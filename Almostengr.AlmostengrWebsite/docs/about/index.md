# About

## "The Almost Engineer" Explanation

You probably are wondering how did I come up with
The Almost Engineer name. I work (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field
of Computer Science, have great problem solving skills, and enjoys fixing things instead of paying
someone else to do it for me. However, I have a Business degree from the University of Alabama
(Roll Tide!) instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer.

## Programmer in IT (Information Technology)

My day job is working as a programmer and I have years of experience in building web based
applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living,
often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for
that [code snippet](/technology/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times)
and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding
projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for.

## Why Does Kenny Blog?

I have been been blogging  about gardening, [technology experiences](/technology), 
[about life](/lifestyle), and mishaps for several reasons:

* you learn from your past mistakes
* others can learn from your mistakes before they make them
* you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going
* it provides a way to share thoughts
* provides a place for project documentation

## Blog Technology

Originally, I started blogging on Blogger in 2010.
After several years of a having the blog there, the blog was converted to
Drupal 7. At the time of this switch, I was using Drupal 7 on a number
of websites that I was building and maintaining. So it made sense to use
it for personal use.

In 2019, I converted the blog again from Drupal 7 over to MkDocs. The reason
for this conversion was because I found myself spending more time performing
maintenance updates than writing content. I outline this more in my post on
[switching from Drupal to MkDocs](/technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs).
