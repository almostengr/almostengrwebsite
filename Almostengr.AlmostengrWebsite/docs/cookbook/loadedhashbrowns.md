## Ingredients

* potatoes cut on grater or frozen hash browns
* eggs
* ham, bacon, or sausage
* green onions, chopped
* seasonings
* cooking spray

## Cooking

* Pre-heat waffle iron or maker while chopping and mixing ingredients
* If cutting potatoes into hash browns, remove the excess water from the potatoes
* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the cooking spray
* Spray the waffle iron. Added the combined ingredients. 
* Close waffle iron lid and let cook for 10-15 minutes. The thicker the layer of hash browns, the 
longer it will take to cook. 
* Once the hash browns are done cooking, remove them from the waffle iron.

## Other Notes

* Hash browns were difficult to remove from the waffle iron because of the grooves in the waffle iron. 
* Be sure to use cooking spray before adding the food. It will make removing the cooked items easier.
