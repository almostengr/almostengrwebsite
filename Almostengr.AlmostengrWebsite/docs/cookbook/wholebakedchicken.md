# Whole Baked Chicken with Lemon Pepper Seasoning

## Ingredients

* 1 chicken
* Lemon pepper seasoning (or another seasoning of your choosing)

## Tools

* Pre-heated oven at 400 F (205 C)
* Roasting pan or cast iron skillet
* Refrigerator

## Directions

* Wash the chicken inside and out. Remove all the internal organs.
* Season chicken inside and out. Be sure to also season between
the skin and the meat, especially the breast and thigh areas.
* Place the chicken on the roasting pan or other container in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes to one (1) hour. *This will dry out the
skin, thus allowing to cook without oil.*
* Preheat oven to 40 F
* Once you remove the chicken, place it in the oven.
* Cook the chicken until it reads 165 on a meat thermometer.
If you don't have a meat thermometer, then cook for about 1.5 to 2
hours depending on the weight.
* Remove the chicken from the oven. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.
* Cut chicken into pieces and serve.
