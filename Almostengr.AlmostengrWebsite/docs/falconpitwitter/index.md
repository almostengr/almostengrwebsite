# Falcon Pi Twitter

![](/lightshow/images/20201220presentation/twittertweets.jpg)

This project is designed for Falcon Pi Player to provide updates via Twitter on the light show that 
you are running. Those updates include posting the current song and providing alerts when problems
are detected.

This application is ONLY designed to run on Falcon Pi Players that are installed on Raspberry Pi, but it 
may be possible to run it on Beagle Bone Black (BBB).
