## Summary

the automatic shut off functionality built in.

WANTS TO MAKE YOUR CROCKPOT SMARTER I'M
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP
[MUSIC]
SO MOST CROCK POTS HAVE A VERY
TRADITIONAL SETTINGS OF JUST ONE
STANDARD KNOB NO VARIABLE TIMING OR
ANYTHING DEATH SO THAT NATURE LIKE THIS
ONE IT HAS AN OFF LOW HIGH AND WARM AND
SO YOU CAN SET IT HERE THE ONLY PROBLEM
WITH THIS IS YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY
MONITOR THIS CROCK POT OR MAOLI KEEP
TRACK OF THE TIME SO THAT IT DOESN'T
OVERCOOK YOUR FOOD SO INSTEAD OF
THROWING THIS CROCK POT OUT AS IT DOES
STILL WORK TO MAKE THIS CROCK POT
SMARTER I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY CONNECT IT
TO A TIMER NOW WHAT I CAN DO WITH THIS
TIMER IS SET IT FOR A SPECIFIED DURATION
SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE COOKING SOMETHING
AND REQUIRES FOR EIGHT HOURS ON LOW YOU
CAN SET THE TIMER TO BE ON FOR EIGHT
HOURS AND THEN AFTER THAT EIGHT HOURS IT
TURNS OFF NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING THE NEWER CROCK POTS THAT HAVE
THESE TIMERS BUILT INTO IT SWITCH TO A
WARM SETTING TO KEEP THE FOOD WARM UNTIL
I CAN GET BACK TO IT THAT CAN STILL BE
ACCOMPLISHED USING THIS TIMER SO WHAT
YOU CAN DO IS SET IT FOR YOUR EIGHT
HOURS OR WHATEVER THE AMOUNT OF COOK
TIME IS AND THEN AFTER THAT AMOUNT OF
COOK TIME SINCE THIS TIMER HAS 30 MINUTE
INCREMENTS WHAT I DO AFTER THAT 8 HOURS
IS SET THE TIMER TO TURN ALONG FOR 30
MINUTES AND THEN TURN OFF FOR 30 MINUTES
OR YOU CAN ALSO DO TURN ON FOR 30
MINUTES AND THEN ALL FOR AN HOUR AND
THEN BACK ON AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 30
MINUTES AND ALL FOR AN HOUR THIS WILL
KEEP YOUR FOOD WARM AS I'VE TRIED IT
MANY OF TIMES AND MOST OF THE TIME WHEN
YOU DO DO THIS IF YOU GET TO IT SOON
THEREAFTER SO LET'S SAY YOU COOK IT FOR
8 HOURS AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT
FOR 10 HOURS THE CROCK POT IS USUALLY
STILL HOT WITH THE 30 MINUTES ON 30
MINUTES OFF OR EVEN 30 MINUTES ON AND AN
HOUR OFF THEREFORE THESE TIMER IS ONLY
ABOUT 2 BUCKS THE CROCK POT OF COURSE
COST WAY MORE THAN THAT SO IT'S EASIER
JUST TO ADAPT THE EXISTING CROCK POT AND
ADD A TIMER TO MAKE IT JUST THAT MUCH
SMARTER THAN BUYING A BRAND NEW CROP
