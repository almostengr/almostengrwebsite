what's going on fellow engineers today
i actually have a handy job and so i'm
going to be
showing you uh some of the details
related to that job
i have my tools already loaded up and
about head to head out this particular
job is for
a tv mounting this tv mounting
i'm not going to actually do video of me
actually installing
that inside the customer's house because
i don't like to do that
usually i'll just take pictures so i'll
discuss like the steps i do
as i'm mounting it with the pictures
that i'll show you coming up
all right i have pulled up to the
customer's house so the next part of the
process
is i check in on the handy app to let
the
handy though as well as the customer
know that i have arrived
at their location all right so what we
have here is a tv
install this is the tv that the customer
wanted to install
he has like a workout space if you will
a workout room
and uh this is a tcl i believe it is as
you see here it is a 32 inch smart
cv and he wanted it mount on the wall
that way when he works out
you know you can turn it on move it away
from the wall do what you got to do
then when you're done turn it off so be
it
uh also with this tv he provided
the on the tv mount as you see
from this is the instruction manual it
is a 32 to 47 inch mount but is a single
mount so it literally mounts to a single
stud on the wall
and it's also a mount that articulates
so it can be moved in and out and the tv
you know twist turned rather you know
left or right
to position it where it needs to be
positioned
all right the first step in this was to
you had to it came with a template the
mount that is
and you had to drill three holes on the
wall to
mount the three bolts that would
eventually come in that's in a future
step
uh the what i did i had to use my stud
finder to locate
where the stud was on the wall and so
once i found that stud
i like i said drill the holes there
because this room is at a a
rather different angle this wall that is
being mounted to
is a full wall i believe this wall was
eight no excuse me maybe nine or ten
feet
but on the other side of where this wall
is is actually a knee wall
so if you're not familiar knee walls are
usually a short vertical wall
three to four feet high and then the
remaining height
of that wall is a sloped angle which is
the back side of the roof and so
positioning it where it was
and trying to get it in between you know
essentially a
angle like this where you have the
vertical wall on this side and then the
slope group on this side
and to get it high enough so that if the
tv is out you can walk underneath it and
not hit your head
but also not too high
that it bumps the wall over here on the
the sloped wall
or sloped ceiling if you will so that
was a little bit of challenge i measured
it
probably about three or four times and
even when i measured it though several
times i wasn't 100
sure that i actually got it in the right
spot but
i managed to do so so after that uh
the three holes are in the wall the next
step is to mount the
bracket onto the back of the tv and so
this also came
in the bracket that is came with the tv
mount
and also these four screws here and
depending on
this tv because it accepts so many sizes
you see there are multiple holes here
and it actually has
some extension arms that came in the kit
that allow you to attach
for even bigger tvs but because this is
the smallest size that
this mount will accommodate i didn't
need all of that extra hardware
so i was able to use the four screws on
the actual plate itself
alright the next part i mounted the
mount to the wall
and as you see those three holes that i
drilled earlier are where the three
bolts are
at and pay attention because some mounts
do have like arrows of how those mounts
are supposed to be installed and as you
see here
this mount actually has a up arrow
because this is supposed to be
in the up direction because the actual
where the the back plate on the tv
connects to this mount
is designed to only work one way so if
you install it upside down the tv won't
stay on
so pay attention pay attention pay
attention
oftentimes they the manual will also
mention
whether the mount should be a right side
up or upside down or
if it if you can even install it upside
down but like i say pay attention
now if you notice this kind of this hole
here is not straight
centered into the opening and the reason
being is because
well i put the level onto the side of
the mount itself because sometimes you
may not drill
exactly center into the stud that
happens
you know a little bit of user error in
there sometimes
and it could also be the fault of stud
finder because all stuff finders are not
a hundred percent accurate all the time
that being said though
this one is like i said it's not square
center in here but the mount itself
was vertical you know 100 level because
i put the level on it once i got the top
bolt in
then i put the level on it and moved it
over as it needed to be so that it
remained level
and then secure the bolt in place
all right now here's a different angle
for the mounts
the top and bottom bolts have
covers that go over there that way you
don't see them when the tv is moved away
from the wall
the middle one doesn't because i think
the way they designed it they
would think hey if you're going to put
this tv on the wall that middle mount is
not i mean that middle screw
is not as significant to be seen so
there was no cover for that one
you can also see that i've mounted the
tv here and
up here is two screws that actually
secure the mounting plate which is this
right here to the
mount itself and the top half doesn't
even actually have
bolts in it it just has this kind of
like a hook like this
and so the arm just sits on top of that
and so that's how the top of it is held
in and then as
i mentioned the bottom part is held in
with these two screws here
and here is the final a different view
of the final installation
so as you see and here there is this
angle
uh slope of the ceiling as well as over
here
but it does fit in the space and it can
be moved
you know at any angle and here's a
different angle of that room as you see
again this is the this is the back side
of the roof
or the ceiling for this room because it
does have knee walls so it's very
of a very tight space i didn't run
the cables down to the outlet the
customer stated that he has some
additional cables that he wanted to run
and he wanted to get
the they have this uh what they call
like a wire channel
and he wanted to get that and install
that but he said he would do that
himself
so i left the plug off of there because
there is no plug
up here in this area the plug was uh
directly below where this went so
if it wasn't on this stud it may have
been on the next stud over
so he probably would have had to get
like a surge protector or an extension
cord of some sort
to be able to run that distance in
addition to being able to
uh have enough slack in here so that he
can move it in and out as need be
when he's in the room and with that the
tv install is completed as you saw the
installation was in a fairly tight space
but the customer is
happy where it was placed because that
is where he wanted it to be
so i've now checked out the handy app
and that completes
this job so with
this job in particular it was booked for
two hours but i was able to finish it in
roughly 45 minutes or so
so when that happens handy still pays
you for the full two hours because that
is what the customer booked
so you know the faster you work and you
know of course if you
book if you do it faster and get it
right then you're hourly pay rate
if you will essentially goes up so for
that particular
install i got i think it was paying 50
for the two hour period so because i did
it faster than
maybe i got 50 an hour so
not bad for you know hours worth of work
not including the
drive time to and from the customer's
house
