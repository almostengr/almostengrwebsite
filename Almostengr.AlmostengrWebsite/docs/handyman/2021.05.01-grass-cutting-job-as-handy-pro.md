what is going on fellow engineers this
video
is another handyman video although today
is not saturday i am doing
some work i have a customer
who has marked me as a favorite customer
on handy
i'm assuming just based off the ratings
because i have not done any work for
this customer
before and this customer has me
scheduled for
a lawn service so cutting grass
edging those type of things and they've
set me up already
even without seeing like seeing my first
work i just like i say based off the
rating
that they want me to be a recurring
thing
so i'm headed to do that work now
and let you know once i check in
*Music*
this job did not go how handy described
it
in it they said that the customer's yard
was about
no more than 5 000 square feet coming to
find out
he actually had a little bit more
probably
close to no more than 10 000 square feet
uh and that you know because of that
i had my mower you know but he allowed
me to the customer allowed me to use his
mower
which was a riding mower and
i was able to get the job done in about
an hour
that's from using the riding more in
addition to
blowing off the driveway so
pretty good experience he you know
said hey you know probably want to use
you again
even though he did not have knowledge
that this particular job
was already booked for the next
um several weeks out
so that was kind of a surprise to him
so he made he said he may cancel it but
you know pretty much he does want me to
come back for
a future job and so our future grass
cutting that is
so that is a good thing um
i that was my first time using a writing
lawnmower so i had to get a little crash
course on how to use it
pretty simple and straightforward though
um
do i think i need a riding no more not
really if i was
full time in the grass cutting business
yes i would definitely get one
but for the odds of one-off
jobs that are slightly bigger than the
other probably not
most of the grass-cutting jobs that i
have they are in the city
and not in such an area like where this
particular customer was where it's kind
of a mix
of city and rule so i usually don't have
that type of
problem um where the customer
will say hey yeah this is a little bit
too big
one of the other things that handy did
not specify that once i got to
talking with the customer is he wanted
the clippings bagged
instead of left bottle on the lawn um
but nowhere in there did handy specify
that piece of information which would
have been very helpful
so um
yeah so sometimes they don't always get
it right but you know
you have to deal with it as much as you
can
and go forward so ultimately i did do
a good job according to the customer
so no concerns there and no worries for
future jobs so if you have any questions
