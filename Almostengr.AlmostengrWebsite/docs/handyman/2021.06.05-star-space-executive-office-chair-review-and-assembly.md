## Problem

The chair that I previous had, experienced a lot more wear and tear during the pandemic as I was working 
from home. Not to mention, the chair had seen better days. It was manufactured in 1965 (really it has the
date stamped on the bottom), so it was time for an upgrade.

## Solution

I purchased a replacement chair. I had considered gaming chairs, but those were not as comfortable. Thus 
this executive office chair. I talk about it in more detail in the video below.
