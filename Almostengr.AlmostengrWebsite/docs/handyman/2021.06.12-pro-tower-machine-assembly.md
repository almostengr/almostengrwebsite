what's going on good people today's
video
i'm going to be talking about the
assembly for a
pro pt 600 power tower it
is a workout machine um that i had to
assemble for a customer
here we go
*Music*
all right this particular machine i like
i said i had to go
and assemble it for a customer i
don't have the specifics of like how
long
they how much it cost or anything of
that nature but
i did once i started opening the
packaging and
following the assembly instructions it
did show a reference to
dick's sporting goods so if you are
interested in that you probably can get
that from dick's sporting goods
and so this is the box i did not take as
many pictures as i
normally do when i do these type of
videos um
that's just something a mistake on my
end
uh but this is the finalized machine
you know once it is assembled and so it
has
multiple workout uh that multiple
workouts that you can do on here
and so this uh i guess cushion here
actually it goes here on the back but it
can also go down here
on the bottom as you see there's this
support here and support here so you can
take it off and then put it down there
and then use it as a
knee pad of sorts to do other
workouts on the machine and so
uh the machine for this uh for as large
as it is the
assembly was relatively easy to do i was
able to complete everything in about an
hour
uh majority of the bolts are the same
so it has a pretty much every bolt that
you see
here with the exception of probably
about
six maybe eight of them
are exactly the same so it's very
difficult to
make a mistake when trying to assemble
this because of the fact there's so
there's a lot of the same parts that go
on the majority of the machine
and for these bolts that are here
is pretty much a bolt you put a washer
on one end
you slide it through wherever it's
supposed to go then you put a washer on
the other end and then you put a
nut on the end of that bolt and all the
nuts on here are
locking nuts so that they do not back
out easy as you are
doing the workouts or whatever the case
um i did do a couple of reps on it and
it was able to hold me
you know fine the maximum capacity
according to the assembly instructions
is 300 pounds for this particular
machine
the bars here the pull-up bars where you
can do your
i believe you do your dips these
actually do come out this orange ball
here
and there's one on the other side you
pull these out and then these
drop down so that you have more space to
do
your pull-ups which is up here
as i mentioned you can move this from
this position down to the bottom here
and then you also have like things where
you can do like leg curls and so forth
so it's useful um i actually have
considered getting one of these myself
just to be able to do some
body weight workouts but it was fairly
easy to assemble like i say
in and out in about an hour i did have
to use
my hammer drill i probably could have
gotten away with using like a
socket wrench or um just a regular
wrench to tighten up the nuts and bolts
but given that those lock those lock
washers on
on there pretty strongly and so pretty
much every time i went to
go and tighten the
bolts on here the hammer function like
immediately
almost kicked in uh just to
put the nut on the bolt so uh
i think it's pretty sturdy on here i did
take care to make sure that
those were not too tight that actually
that the hammer drill didn't tighten so
tight that actually started bending the
metal
but the metal uh i think i may have over
drilled it just a little bit on some of
them but the metal did not flex
after maybe a little bit over tightening
those
um the only other
i guess concern about this is so when
you're putting this together
the instructions do have like written
steps
because i'm so used to putting the you
know furniture and other assemblies
together without actually reading the
written steps
i was able to do it strictly just off
the photos the diagrams on there are
pretty clear
on how you're supposed to assemble it
and what bolt goes where
the only thing i will say is
i will add to that that the instructions
also mentioned that you are supposed to
assemble everything
hand tighten only in the beginning and
that's what i did so i got all the bolts
in
and hand tighten them so that they
didn't you know the whole thing didn't
fall back apart as i was still
assembling
assembling it and then once i got the
whole assembly together
then i started on the side over here
starting and making my way from one bolt
all the way around
and then came back on the other side and
did the same thing
and everything worked out fine
the rubber feet that you see here was
already
attached to the uh metal supports here
so i didn't even have to do that part
it was literally just put in all the
bolts so screw i had i did have to
secure these uh
armrest pads on the uh horizontal
supports here and this back pad to
this cross plate here um but other than
that
everything else was straightforward
didn't have to paint or anything
of that nature so this is just a
walkthrough of how you know easy was to
assemble this
fairly straightforward if you have any
questions about this particular product
