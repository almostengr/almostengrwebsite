## Technology Blog

A programmer that does not talk (or in this case write) about technology probably is not a good programmer. 
I share my code snippets, difficulties with coding, and  things technology here.

## Projects

When you do work that solves a problem, show it off. I have done many projects over the years. Each project
had a challenge with an end goal in mind. I share my personal projects here and the source code on 
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, 
so that others may learn from my previous work.
Check out [my projects](/projects).
