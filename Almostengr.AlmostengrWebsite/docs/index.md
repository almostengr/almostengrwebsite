## Featured Project - Christmas Light Show

Each year, I do a animated [Christmas light show](/projects/christmas-light-show). The show posts song 
countdown to Christmas and posts song information 
<a href="https://twitter.com/hplightshow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> via a custom software application.
More information about the project, including song information, show times, and links to previous 
years show videos, are avaiable on the [project page](/project/christmas-light-show).

## Technology Blog

A programmer that does not talk (or in this case write) about technology probably is not a good programmer. 
I share 
[my code snippets](/technology/2022.09.17-length-of-shell-variable/), 
[difficulties with coding](/technology/2021.08.12-jquery-validator-with-parameter/), 
and other things technology here.

## Projects

When you do work that solves a problem, show it off. I have done many projects over the years. Each project
had a challenge with an end goal in mind. I share my personal projects here and the source code on 
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, 
so that others may learn from my previous work.
Check out [my projects](/projects).
