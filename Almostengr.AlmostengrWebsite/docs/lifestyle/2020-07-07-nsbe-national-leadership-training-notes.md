### General Session

* Ready, Set, Grow
* read the plan that was shared by the Genius Group

### NSBE Scientific Journal

* option 1) have a website within the existing website.
* option 2) have a printed copy of the journal, cost estimated $30K
* my preference is that a digital copy be provided, and if they want printed, then they
can print it themselves
* there's a need for students and professionals to do studies so that they can better themselves
* articles in journal would have a particular focus, have to go through a review process

### Cross Functional with Finance and Communication

* database of licensed professionals
* offer funding for courses, outreaches
* scholarships for the Professional members
* have a social media campaign with promoting the course; have the members
promote the event in a social media blurb
* leveraging open source software instead of using the paid software; CiviCRM and GIMP mentioned
* need to set up donation circles, and publically recognize the individuals that do donate. That will
encourage those that have not already donated to do so.
* how we can better have the Finanace Zone integrate with the Communication Zone
* Fonteva, name of the CRM system that NSBE will be moving towards.

### Promoting The NSBE Brand

* brands are identified by their logo; logo must stand out
* 4 official logos can be used, can be downloaded from the national website
* don't modify the logo outside the guidelines
* professionals as a series of logos as well,
* have to submit design, in pdf, to the National Publications chairperson; there is a logo approval form;
* need to have a consistency in sharing our message
* Sometimes the conversation online, needs to move to email or DM to be fully addressed. Sometimes the
conversation can be blown out of proportion if not done in that manner.
* Sometimes members dont want to receive certain emails; thus will miss some of those critical communications
* Page of links to all the forms that exist; therefore members dont have to send emails and those emails
end up getting overlooked.
* need to determine what the brand will become
* collegiate member not interested in becoming a Professional member; need to communicate the benefits
of being a Professional member; have the collegiate members let them know where they can get help
from the Professionals members; let it be known where the seniors are headed

### Marketing 101: Utilizing the Social Media, the Website and Press

* look to see if there was a previous campaign done, perhaps a transition document; editorial calendar;
* need to know the audience and who are you trying to reach; demographics (age, professional, major,
interests, education)
* Have links or forms, hashtags; allow for interactions to happen
* advised to use 3-4 hashtags, max; tag sponsors
* Check the analytics for your social media
* ask about if Google Analytics will be part of the new website; will regional Comm zone be provided info
* need a welcome message for the website from the current chair; needs to be done ASAP; video or
text can be provided
* doing a Twitter chat?
* possibly do a "Member Monday" where content is posted to have the members engaged with the social media
platform, to have members facilitate the discussion around engineering and STEM
* multiple ways to distribute information: social media, email, website; draw them to the respective website
* have the same message on multiple platforms at the same time
* Send email to Yvette requesting the analytics information be provided
* why working with the media is important; it can be used as leverage to talk about the campaign that is
currently ongoing; can include the stats in the email; media needs to have a balance of good and bad
stories; 
* be sure in mentioning to the reporter, share the information about the event such as the who, what,
where, when, and why; provide some of the keynote speakers that could possibly be interviewed; be 
strategic in who you reach out too
