# Background

I have had a blog for many of years now. When you combine the stuff that I have hear, plus the stuff 
that I have on Facebook before I set up this blog, that's over 10 years worth of content.  My goal is to be able to continue to share 
content on multiple platforms that those who read the blog can benefit from. 

## Why By The Book?

Occasionally I go in the bookstore to see what's there, not because I am actually going in to buy a particular
book. As I took my usual stroll to the Technology section, I saw "Blogging for Dummies". Before buying 
the book, I took a peek at what was in the table of contents. I saw that it covered some areas that I was 
interested in, but had not yet mastered, such as creating good or great content, marketing that content, 
and using the blog as a source of income. Thus I purchased the book. 

## Construction Ahead

As I read the book, which will not be expeditiously, you will see changes made to the blog. I have actually considered doing a layout redesign as well.
