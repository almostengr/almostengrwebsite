Each year for about the last 5 years, during the month of January, I do a fast. The church that I previously 
attended would do fasting and prayer as a congregation. There are differnet levels of fasting, and 
suggestions were offered as to the levels of food fasting each person could do. Of course, those 
wtih medical conditions, should talk to their doctor first before doing anything extreme. 

For my fast, I always picked a variation of things to fast from. Some included meat, cheese, social media,
sodas, and more. Others were opposite and to make a habit to do more of something instead of giving 
up something.

The goals 

## 2022 Fasting Objectives

As for 2022, things that I will be doing during this year's fast. My objective is to provide regular 
updates to this post.

### No Meat

In the past, I have found that I feel different, like more energized, when have not eaten meat for the 
21 day period.  In addition, I have lost weight, give or take 10 pounds, 
around my midsection without changing my exercise 
routine. Going further by doing no cheese at the same time, makes even more weight come off. I am not a 
dietician, but my theory on this and the documentaries that I have seen, that meat takes longer to digest 
and process out of the body. Thus a lot of us that heavily eat meat and less vegetables (in other 
words the typical American diet) are carrying around dead weight and excess fat from eating so much meat. 
Now there are vegetarians and vegans that are fat, but that is not solely because of what they eat. 

### Daily Scripture

Reading the Bible offers wisdom and knowledge. I had not been doing this judiciously in 2021, so I want to 
make a change in this habit. I have two Bible apps on my phone and sometimes I dismiss the daily 
notification to read a scripture. Will not do that during this period in hopes to make reading the Word 
a regular habit.

### Pack A Lunch

After making all the payments to have a wedding in 2021, I need to recoup my finances and start taking a 
lunch. When I do cook, I have a tendency to cook too much and thus can eat it for a day or two afterwards. 
Furthermore, the cost of everything has gone up since the pandemic. Inflation, inflation, in-fla-tion.
I remember when the small back of chips were 25 cents. Now those similar size bags, because they have reduce the 
size of the bag so that people still buy them instead of increasing the cost, cost 75 cents in some stores.

### Completing More Projects Before Starting New Ones

I realize that I have a lot of ideas and goals to accomplish. Problem is that I regularly start something, 
and can be hesistant to complete it. For example, my house has knee walls. In some parts of the wall, the 
insulation has fallen out from the wall cavity. I purchased some insulation in early 2020 with the intention 
of replacing the worn, squirrrel-chewed insulation with new insulation and enclosing it in the wall cavity. 
That insulation is in the same spot and in the original packaging
from when I brought it home after purchasing it. Smh at myself. Thus my goal during this time and this year, 
is to work on these in progress projects, both coding and home improvement, before starting new ones. 
I will be posting these projects on my business

## Day 1 - January 10

Ended up buying a lunch today since I did not cook a dinner that did not have meat the day before. That 
lunch consisted of eating collard greens, corn, cornbread, and fried okra.
I did avoid meat and cheese on this day.
