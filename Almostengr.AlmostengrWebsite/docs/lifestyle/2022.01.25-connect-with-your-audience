## Speech Outline - Gardening with Technology

### Intro 1

At one point in time, before World War 1 and the Industrial Revolution, most Americans had a garden or farm on their property. The Industrial Revolution changed all of that. Now we go to grocery stores to get food that has traveled for days or weeks to the store and not be as fresh. What if there was a way for us to go back to gardening at home and not have to put in as much effort as a farmer?

### FarmBot (Range Rover)
