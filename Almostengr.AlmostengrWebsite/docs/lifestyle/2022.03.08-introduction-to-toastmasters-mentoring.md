Below is the outline for the speech that I did for Level 2 of the Innovating Planning tract. 
This speech is to be related to the topic of mentoring. 
The objective is to write
a 5- to 7-minute speech about a time when you were a protégé. Share the impact and importance of having a mentor.

## Introduction

* mentor - Webster defines as "a trusted counselor or guide"
* protege - Webster defines as "one who is protected or trained or whose career is furthered by a person of experience, prominence, or influence"
* thesis: starting journey with experience, offer different perspectives

## Starting Journey With Experience

* the protege learns from the experience of the mentor
* puts you in a better position than starting with no experience
* human internet, since people don't use libraries anymore (or like they used to); wealth of knowledge
* 

### Mentor and Protege Examples

* pastor and congregation
* boss and employee
* teacher and student

## My Experience



## Different Perspectives

* young can learn from old and old can learn from new
* best practices change over time, and thus more efficient way of doing things can exist if you learn from 
those younger than you
* different experiences, both lifestyle and working styles, impact the perspectives that each person 
has; sometimes can relate, sometimes cannot


## Conclusion

*
