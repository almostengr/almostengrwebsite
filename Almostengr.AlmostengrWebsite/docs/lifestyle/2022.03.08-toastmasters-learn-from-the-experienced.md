Below is the outline for the speech that I did for Level 2 of the Innovating Planning tract. 
This speech is to be related to the topic of mentoring. 
The objective is to write
a 5- to 7-minute speech about a time when you were a protégé. Share the impact and importance of having a mentor.

## Introduction

* describe a time when you were a protege;
* mentor - Webster defines as "a trusted counselor or guide"
* protege - Webster defines as "one who is protected or trained or whose career is furthered by a person of experience, prominence, or influence"
* thesis: starting journey with experience, importance of mentorship 

## Starting Journey With Experience

* the protege learns from the experience of the mentor
* puts you in a better position than starting with no experience
* human internet, since people don't use libraries anymore (or like they used to); wealth of knowledge
* mentor can provide you guidance so that you don't repeat the mistakes that 
they made when going down similar paths or journeys
* always have tried to position myself as protege because there's always something new to learn, 
especially when working in technology; new trends and best practices all the time

### Mentor and Protege Examples

* pastor and congregation
* boss and employee
* teacher and student

## College
 
* pair programming when working in IT office
* took similar classes and were able to discuss the changes that had occurred with the course
and the differences in the technologies and best practices that were taught
* able to take the things learned from the mentor and applied them to the assignments in my classes 
and the work that I currently do as an IT professional 

## Importance of Mentorship

* young can learn from old and the old can learn from young
* best practices change over time, and thus more efficient way of doing things can exist if you learn 
from those younger than you; reciprocal learning
* different experiences, both lifestyle and working styles, impact the perspectives that each person has
* representation matters; when you see and interact with people that do what you are trying to achieve, 
you are more likely to succeed in that endeavor 

## Conclusion

*
