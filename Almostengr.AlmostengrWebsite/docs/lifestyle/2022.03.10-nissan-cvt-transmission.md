I see a lot of articles and videos that talk about how Nissan CVTs (Continuously Variable Transmissions) are trash and 
as an owner of one I wanted to share my thoughts.

At the writing of this article, my Altima has 129K miles on the odometer. My car was one of the first ones to come 
out with the redesigned transmission. Within the first year, I had to take it back to the dealership to get the 
transmission reprogrammed twice because of two different Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) that were issued by 
Nissan in relation to the transmission. 

## Change The Transmission Fluid

Now I recognize that there are some situations that transmissions in Nissans do fail. The majority of the failures
that I have seen 
due to people failing to change the transmission fluid at the appropriate interval. My thoughts 
are that the cones that are inside the CVT transmission, can operate within a particular viscosity range of transmission
fluid. 

As the fluid becomes dirty and breaks down over time, they do not provide the correct amount of pressure to the 
cones, thus keeping tension on the belt or chain (V6 engines have chains, 4-cylinders have belts) becomes more difficult. 
In the worse case scenario, too much pressure is applied to the belt, and as a result the belt pops. Not enough pressure 
could be applied to the belt, and as a result the transmissions slips but recovers. 

### Manual Transmissions

When manuals were more common, you didn't have to change fluid in them because they didn't have any. There are some 
exceptions, like those that use brake fluid or clutch fluid to control the clutch. You would know something was 
up because you need both of those systems to drive. In addition, the one that uses brake fluid to control the clutch, 
if the fluid went low, the brake light on the dash would come on indicating a problem.

It seems to me that not changing the fluid in transmissions is still a thing today. Some that manufacturer geared automatic
transmissions do not have a problem with theirs because
