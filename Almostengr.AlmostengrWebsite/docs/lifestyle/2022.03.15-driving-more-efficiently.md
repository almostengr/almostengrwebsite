With the conflict going on between Russia and Ukraine (really Russia bullying Ukraine), the 
cost of gas continues to go up. This is similar to how gas went up during the 2008 recession and
housing crisis. During that time, I was in college. Gas got above the $1 USD mark and 
never looked back. In places on the west coast, 
I remember seeing photos of gas being over $5 per gallon. Here are some of the things that I am 
doing or consider doing in an effort to save on gas with my vehicles.

## Use E85

One of the vehicles that I own can run on E85, but designed for regular gasoline. This type 
of vehicle is called Flex Fuel vehicle. There are a number of things that I have noticed with 
driving on E85 and regular gas. 

### Price

The price for E85 is lower than that for Regular gas at every gas station that I have been to. In
some cases, that price is 15 cents cheaper. In other places, it can be up to 50 cents cheaper. 

### Fuel Economy

When using E85, I do notice that the fuel economy is less than when using regular gas. On the 
contrary, E85 has higher octane, meaning that your engine makes more power when running it. In 
my truck, using E85 and driving at city speeds, results in the truck going into 4 cylinder mode
more often once the crusing speed has bene reached. 4 cylinder mode means that less
gas is being used to run the vehicle instead of using all 8 cylinders.

## Limiting Left Turns

I had read some time ago that UPS designs their routes so that they have little to no left turns. 
By eliminating or having few left turns, this allows them to get packages delivered 
faster and to save money. Packages are delivered faster because they are not waiting at red 
lights to make left turns or for cross traffic to clear. I can agree with this. At some of the 
intersections in my city, the major roads only allocate 30 seconds maximum for left turns when 
the entire phase for a signal may be 1.5 minutes and entire cycle being 3 minutes.

I have started do this where I have and sometimes it does make you go a bit out of the way, but 
it does keep you moving and in some cases you get to your destination a few minutes earlier.
The most beneficial of no left turns are at protected left turn intersections. 

### Protected Left Turn

A Protected Left Turn is a lane that has a designated turn lane and has a phase that allows 
traffic turning left to turn while opposing traffic stops. For me, I try my best to avoid 
these type of left turns, even if that means running my errands in a different order. 

Left turns that have protected and unprotected phases or that have unprotected phases, then 
I still will make a left at these intersections.

### Example

Why are this gas wasters? Lets say a traffic light has a cycle time of 2 minutes, or 1 minute 
for each street. Then Protected Left Turn for each street might get up to 25 percent, or 
15 seconds, for that streets max time for the cycle. That means you and everybody turning left
has 15 seconds to get through the green, and if you do not, then you have to wait another almost
2 minutes to get another opportunity. 

<a href="https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/vCalc/Cost+to+Idle" target="_blank">vcalc.com</a> has a 
Cost to Idle calculator. The formula that they use is 

```text
fuel cost = fuel consumption rate (gallon per hour) * cost of fuel (dollars per gallon) * idle time (minutes)
```

Using the example above, that means 

```text
fuel cost = 0.6 * 3.96 * 2.0 = 0.08 USD
```

That means it costs 8 cents each time that you wait on a protected
left turn, not to mention the 2 minutes that you are waiting.

Vehicles with bigger engines will have a higher consumption rate than those with small engines 
and hybrids.

## Traffic Patterns and Routes

I have different routes that I take to get to different places. Sometimes those routes are not 
the most perferred routes because they go through residential neighborhoods or the road least
travelled, but what I have found is that they have fewer number of stops, or they have
