Last year, when I got home a dog was waiting for me. Didn't ask for it. Wasn't ready for it. Dog was just there, 
hiding between mine and the neighbor's house. I give more details about his initial days with me in my 
[National Puppy Day 2021 post](/lifestyle/2021.03.23-national-puppy-day) and 
[becoming a dog parent](/lifestyle/2021.03.30-becoming-a-dog-parent).

## Territorial

The neighbor has a dog that roams freely about the neighborhood. He always comes back to their yard to rest 
and eat, and supposedly does not like to be chained up in the yard and not stay inside the house. Thing is with 
Buddy is that anytime he sees the neighbor's dog, even if the neighbor's dog is in his own yard, he starts
barking like crazy. 

There was one instance where my dog attempt to go across the street to the neighboring dog's yard, preassumably 
to mess with him, and I had to yell to get him to course correct. He caught a mouthful of words after that 
a knew that he messed up.
