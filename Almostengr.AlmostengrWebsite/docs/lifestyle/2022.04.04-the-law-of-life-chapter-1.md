Was invited to participate in a book club discussion about the book titled 
"The Law of Life: Healing from Disease, Depression, and Damaged Relationships"
by Mark Sandoval. This discussion was regarding Chapter 1 of the book.

* When looking a a tree, the source of the problems start with the roots and soil 
of the tree. Thus cutting off the fruit or leaves of the tree will not fix the 
problem since the tree gets nutrients from the soil.
* disease and other dysfunction in the body usually originate with sin and disobeying;
as we were going through this meeting, the saying "Disease is caused by dis-ease", which
was a phrase that I heard in a sermon years ago
* Proverbs 26:2 - if you get to the root cause, then you will eliminate the problem
* primary and secondary... when you are a second hand smoker, you can still get lung cancer, 
although you were not the one actually smoking the cigarette
