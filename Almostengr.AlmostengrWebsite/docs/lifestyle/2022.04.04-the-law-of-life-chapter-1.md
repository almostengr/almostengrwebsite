Was invited to participate in a book club discussion about the book titled 
"The Law of Life: Healing from Disease, Depression, and Damaged Relationships"
by Mark Sandoval. Below are some of the discussion notes and thoughts that I had from the 
book club session and from reading the book. As I read and the club meets, the 
notes here will be updated accordingly.

## Chapter 1

* When looking a a tree, the source of the problems start with the roots and soil 
of the tree. Thus cutting off the fruit or leaves of the tree will not fix the 
problem since the tree gets nutrients from the soil.
* disease and other dysfunction in the body usually originate with sin and disobeying;
as we were going through this meeting, the saying "Disease is caused by dis-ease", which
was a phrase that I heard in a sermon years ago
* Proverbs 26:2 - if you get to the root cause, then you will eliminate the problem
* primary and secondary... when you are a second hand smoker, you can still get lung cancer, 
although you were not the one actually smoking the cigarette
* Health is a road. The symptoms are the shoulder, disease is the ditch, and death 
is beyond the embankment 
* Men hate going to the doctor because of the "Pride Line". Pride can get you into some 
bad situations as delaying to resolve issues, means that you can get to the point of no return
"If men dealt with relationships like the way they deal with cars and women dealt with 
their cars like they do with their relationships, then things would be better". 
When it comes to it, when attempting to diagnose car issues, the resolution to the problem 
are fairly straighforward. When it comes to relationships, the resolution to a problem 
is not always as straightfoward because of the other person that you are working through 
that issue with.
