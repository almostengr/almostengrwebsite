For this Toastmasters speech, I had to present a proposal about the topic of my 
choosing. I chose to discuss the traffic and switching to not doing things the 
American way in hopes to improve traffic effiencies
 
## Executive Summary 

* improve traffic with designs from other countries

## Introduction

* Traffic in America is bad
* Traffic designers have a number of tactics that they use to make traffic easier, but ends up being confusing 
* example: San Diego, Mira Mesa bike lanes caused confusion; common in other countries though
* Propose that we follow traffic designs and systems used in Netherlands and other countries

## Statement of Need

* traffic will continuously increase as time goes on. From December 2019 number of miles driven increase by 1.3% from December 2018 https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/19dectvt/
* With more traffic, comes more accidents
* When roads become congested, build more lanes; however more lanes are not the answer due to "induced demand"
* Katy Freeway, 26 lanes at its widest

## Description (Solution)

* replace with improvements instead of ripping out and starting over
* build more intelligent traffic systems to prioritize public transit; no sense in bus waiting like a car
* fund more public transit 
* prioritize emergency vehicles; state of Minnesota implemented EMERGENCY VEHICLE PREEMPTION “PRIORITY” for all state DOT managed lights
* reduces response times
* less likely for emergency vehicle crash with passenger vehicle

## Needs Analysis

* additional measures for smarter traffic lights will cost 
* some additional cost for more paint

## Vision for the Future

* roads are more friendly for those that are not in or on a motor vehicle
* being able to get to destination faster
* 

## Summary of Main Points
