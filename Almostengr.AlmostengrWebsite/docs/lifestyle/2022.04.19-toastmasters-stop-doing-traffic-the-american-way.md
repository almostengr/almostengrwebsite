For this Toastmasters speech, I had to present a proposal about the topic of my 
choosing. I chose to discuss the traffic and switching to not doing things the 
American way in hopes to improve traffic effiencies.  This is the Level 3 "Present A Proposal" 
project of the Innovative Planning path. 
 
## Executive Summary (Thesis)

* improve American traffic with designs from other countries

## Introduction (Overview)

* Traffic in America is bad
* 46,000 died on American roadways
* Traffic designers have a number of tactics that they use to make traffic easier, but doesn't solve the problem
* Michigan Left; indirect left turns; carpool lanes; 
* example: San Diego, Mira Mesa advisory bike lane caused confusion; common in other countries though
* Propose that we build better roads like the Netherlands and Europeans instead of building roads "the American way" 

## Statement of Need (necessity and benefits)

* traffic will continuously increase as time goes on. Per Federal Highway Adminstration, December 2019 number of miles driven increase by 1.3% from December 2018 https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/19dectvt/
* With more traffic, comes more accidents, more congestion
* When roads become congested, build more lanes; however more lanes are not the answer due to "induced demand"
* brand new neighborhoods with no sidewalks; implies that you must drive to go somewhere
* have to be a light before phase starts; else have to wait on entire cycle to get a green
* induced demand - increase in demand by improving traffic flow and infrastructure
* Katy Freeway in Houston, Texas; 26 lanes at its widest

## Description (Solution)

* replace when doing improvements or upgrades instead of ripping out and starting over
* cities like Carmel, Indiana have been replacing traffic lights with roundabouts since 1996
* build more intelligent traffic systems to prioritize public transit; no sense in bus waiting like a car
* prioritize emergency vehicles; state of Minnesota implemented EMERGENCY VEHICLE PREEMPTION “PRIORITY” for all state DOT managed lights
* reduces emergency response times
* less likely for emergency vehicle crash with passenger vehicle
* follow advice given in book "Strong Town", which shares practices 

## Needs Analysis (explain costs, equipment, materials, etc required and how costs would be covered)

* additional measures for smarter traffic lights will cost 
* some additional cost for more paint and signs
* cost savings from no traffic light operation and maintenance costs ($200K for signal, $5K per year electric)

## Vision for the Future (possible outcomes)

* Roads are more friendly for those that are not in or on a motor vehicle
* Being able to get to destination faster
* No idling a traffic lights because more roundabouts will be used;
* Carmel, Indiana increase population and fewer accidents and even fewer fatilities 

## Summary of Main Points (recap everything above)
