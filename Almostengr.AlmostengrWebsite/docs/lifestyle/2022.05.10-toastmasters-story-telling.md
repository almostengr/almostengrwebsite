* 5 - 7 minute speech

* the goal: start a youtube channel and build it to make passive income

## Getting Started

* made videos of projects and tasks that I was working on at my house; home repairs and building software
* did video club in high school, but the "advanced" tech that we had was a VCR
* had to expand the skill set; use video editing software like Kdenlive
* struggled to find identity with the channel because it was too broad, not niche specific
* tried to follow the professional creators way of creating videos, but proved to be difficult or well beyond where I currently was
* montetization threshold moved; already had money but not paid and had to wait

## Building A Portfolio

* started posting similar content on personal social media pages
* that lead my followers to start asking me to do work for them
* posted about doing that work, effectively creating a content generating machine; do the work, talk and share about the work
* 
* signed up as an independent contractor; Handy, Wal-Mart, HomeAdvisor; plenty of opportunities, not plenty of money 
* 

## Legal and Legit

* filed the paperwork for business in 2021
* learn from others that are in business and run youtube channels
* cutting left to right, wont get hit with trimmer debris; right to left and get swarmed
* continued to produce content, but overworked at times
* created automations and looked for ways to improve processes; being more efficient 
* being more efficient, then can do more work and thus more money
