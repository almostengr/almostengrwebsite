* 5 - 7 minute speech

* the goal: start a youtube channel and build it to make passive income

* made videos of projects and tasks that I was working on at my house; home repairs and building software
* had to expand the skillet; did video club in high school, but the "advanced" tech that we had was a VCR
* learning video editing software, Kdenlive

* started posting similar content on personal social media pages
* those that I did not really know and did really know decided to ask me to do work for them
* then started posting about that work, effectively creating a content generating machine; do the work, post about the work

* started the business, filed the paperwork 
* continued to produce content, but overworked at times 
* created automations and looked for ways to improve processes; being more efficient 
* being more efficient, then can do more work and thus more money 
*
