Managed to avoid it for this long, but I caught COVID. Think it was when I went out to pick up 
some items for a customer for work at their house, but not 100% sure of this.

I am documenting my experience with this so that others may learn from it. I will post updates 
on this post as they are available.

## Day 0

Later in the evening, developed a slightly sore throat. Had no issues or symptoms all day.

## Day 1

Woke up about 1:30 AM to a even more sore 
throat and fever. 

Went to get checked out the following morning after a not well rested night. Was tested for 
strep throat and COVID, because my symptoms matched both. Got a confirmed test of COVID postiive.

Was advised by the doctor to:

* drink plenty of fluids, including sports drinks for headaches
* self-quarantine at home for 5 days
* take over the counter medications that correspond to the symptoms that I am experiencing
* if still not feeling better after 5 days, come back and they can retest
* wear a mask if you have to go out

Took over the counter medicine as advised during the day and before going to bed.
Did note that I was a bit more sleepy than usual, even during
the day time. 

Developed a headache during the day, but it would come and go in waves.

I have heart rate and O2 meter on my phone. I used it to check my stats and the O2 was at 92%. 
Now it is a known fact that devices like this can misread for people that have dark skin as it 
uses infrared light to do these measurements. In fact, I had to do the reading multiple times, 
because it kept malfunctioning when doing the reading as if my finger was not on the sensor.

Sleep well though, but that could be because of the medication that I took before going to
bed.

## Day 2

Still had a fever. It would fluctuate between mild and body seriously shaking. 

Drank plently of fluids. Probably was drinking too much, because sometimes the "output" 
came out clear. However, this is not a bad thing long as it is properly balanced with drinking non-water
fluids as well.

Didn't really have an appetite, but I ate anyway. Lack of appetite was probably because I had been drinking 
a lot more fluids that usual. I was able to taste and smell my food contrary to what others have said.

I remember when a former boss had got COVID. One thing that he said that he did was going outside for 
walks. Using Google Maps, I used the Measure Distance tool to measure the perimeter of my backyard. 
Figure this would be a safer option than walking up and down the street in case something unexpected 
where to happen. With the Tool, my backyard as a perimeter of just over 300 ft. I wanted to do a least 1 
mile per day so I did the math. 8.5 laps is about 1/2 a mile in my backyard. That evening, I did half a mile 
in the backyard.

Took OTC medication before going to bed as well as vitamins. Slept throughout the night. Sweated a lot 
during my sleep. Normally when I sweat in my sleep and wake up, I have a difficult time going back to sleep.
This time, I didnt have that problem. I adjusted my sleep position, and fell back asleep.

Will add that I slept on my sides and not face up. Supposedly sleeping on sides or face down is the best 
way as it forces your lungs to work harder and prevents the condition from getting worse.

## Day 3

Woke up and did the morning 1/2 mile (0.8 km) walk in the backyard. Did not have any issues. 

Would occasionally cough up mucus. Had a dark yellow tint to it and there was not a lot of it.
When I did have to cough, it would be 
a rough, dry, burning cough, but you could hear the lungs trying to get rid of mucus. 

Thermometer still read as me having a fever, but I did not have body chills like in the days past.

Had a partially stopped up nose basically all day. Took OTC medication for symptoms.

That afternoon, did another 1/2 mile walk in the backyard.
When walking, could feel a bit dizzy, but not enough that I would fall over. Definitely did not try running.
Was able to navigate steps and uneven terrain without problem.
