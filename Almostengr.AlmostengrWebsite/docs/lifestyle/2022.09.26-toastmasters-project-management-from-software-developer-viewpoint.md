## Spring Planning

* pick items from the backlog that can be completed in the upcoming weeks or month
* dont overload the truck
* measured using team velocity; equivalent to how fast are we going

## Do the Work

* code your items
* confirm that your items work correctly 
* burn down chart, shows velocity; similar to speed limit
* have the items tested for quality and user acceptance
* release them (send to production) for use by users

## Sprint review - how well or bad things went

* removing the bottle necks
* ways to make the cycle go faster (reduce review time)
* 

## Repeat
