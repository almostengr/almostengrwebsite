This is the outline for my speech on Level 4 of the Innovative Planning, Manage 
Projects Successfully. I talk about what a typical sprint looks like as a Software 
Developer. 

The first part of this speech is to talk about what will be done in the project. For 
sprint planning, that is looking at the backlog and selecting items. 

## Engineering Day at the Park

* have grade school students learn about STEM
* publicize the event - social media, local news, other platforms
* have sponsors to provide food, supplies, or donations
* select projects that can be done by the students
* reserving the space, Oak Park
* filing necessary permits with city
*
