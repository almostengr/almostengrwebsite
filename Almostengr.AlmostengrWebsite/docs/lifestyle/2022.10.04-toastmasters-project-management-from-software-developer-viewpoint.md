This is the outline for my speech on Level 4 of the Innovative Planning, Manage 
Projects Successfully. I talk about what a typical sprint looks like as a Software 
Developer. 

## Do the Work

* code your items
* confirm that your items work correctly 
* burn down chart, shows velocity; similar to speed limit
* have the items tested for quality and user acceptance
* release them (send to production) for use by users

## Sprint review - how well or bad things went

* removing the bottle necks
* ways to make the cycle go faster (reduce review time)
* what did and did not get accomplished

## Repeat

* start a new cycle
* can see who performs fast and does not
