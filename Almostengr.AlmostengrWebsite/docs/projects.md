## Coding Challenges (2021-Present)

Coding challenges are ongoing projects to learn new coding designs and practices. 
I periodically do coding challenges. The reason that I do challenges is to test my knowledge of the
programming language and expose myself to different aspects of the language.
I elaborate further about why I suggest that others do coding challenges in a blog post titled
[Why Do Coding Challenges](/technology/2021.06.25-why-do-coding-challenges).
<p>Technologies: C#</p>

## NSBE Montgomery Professionals Website (2020)

<div class="col">
<p>
The National Society of Black Engineers, Montgomery Professionals (NSBE-MP) is a chapter of NSBE. This
project consisted of redesigning the previous version website to the current version.

The previous webste ran on Drupal 7. Since Drupal 7 was nearing retirement in summer of 2021, a decision had
to be made. Either upgrade to Drupal 8 or change to a different website platform. The decision was decided
to change to a static generated website because using a traditional content management system could
put the website at risk if it was not kept up to date.

The current website is a static generated website. With the use of
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> the static website files
are created and automatically deployed to the production environment when updates are made. Effectively
GitHub serves as the content management system for this website. As part up this update, the website was
updated to use
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> so that it would be mobile friendly.

## Ubuntu Automation Scripts (2018-Present)

<div class="row mb-3">
<div class="col">
<p>
The purpose of this repository is to hold scripts that use for routine tasks, such as updating packages,
starting virtual machines, and automatically commiting files. When you run the same commands over
and over again, it is often best to put them into a script and then just call the script when you need it.
I have created a playlist that contains some of the scripts used. You can

<div class="col">
Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology.
Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home.
I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community.
The documentation for <a href="https://home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> can be
somewhat daunting for the beginnger. By providing my
configuration, hopefully it will assist you and others with their configuraiton of their own instance.

## FarmOS NWS Drupal 7 Module

<div class="row mb-3">
<div class="col">
<p>
The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service to allow it
to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.
Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as
temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the
maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.

## Scrap Code Dump Blog (2010)

This was the first version of by blog hosted on Blogger. In 2015, I moved the blog from Blogger
to a dedicated site for a business that I was starting. That business idea did not succeed,
so I decided to take the existing content and make it part of my personal blog. Thus the current
website, The Almost Engineer, has this content.
