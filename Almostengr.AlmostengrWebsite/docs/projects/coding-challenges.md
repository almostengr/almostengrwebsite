Coding challenges are ongoing projects to learn new coding designs and practices. 
I periodically do coding challenges. The reason that I do challenges is to test my knowledge of the
programming language and expose myself to different aspects and concepts of the language.
I elaborate further about why I suggest that others do coding challenges in a blog post titled
[Why Do Coding Challenges](/technology/2021.06.25-why-do-coding-challenges).
