title: FarmOS NWS (National Weather Service) Drupal 7 Module
---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow 
<a href="https://farmos.org/" target="_blank">FarmOS</a> to use data from the 
<a href="https://www.weather.gov" target="_blank">National Weather Service</a> to allow it
to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as
temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the
maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.
