## Kdenlive to YouTube (2019)

This project was to build an automation that would take video projects that I have created
with Kdenlive, generate them, and then upload them to YouTube automatically.

The first phase of this project, which was to render videos from a queue of
Kdenlive archive files. I have videos on my YouTube channel that discuss some of the
aspects of the code.

**Technologies:** Java
