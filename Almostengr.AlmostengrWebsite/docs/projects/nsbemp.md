The National Society of Black Engineers, Montgomery Professionals (NSBE-MP) is a chapter of NSBE. This
project consisted of redesigning the previous version website to the current version.

## Previous Technology

The previous webste ran on Drupal 7. Since Drupal 7 was nearing retirement in summer of 2021, a decision had
to be made. Either upgrade to Drupal 8 or change to a different website platform. The decision was decided
to change to a static generated website because using a traditional content management system could
put the website at risk if it was not kept up to date.

## Current Technology

The current website is a static generated website. With the use of
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> the static website files
are created and automatically deployed to the production environment when updates are made. Effectively
GitHub serves as the content management system for this website. As part up this update, the website was
updated to use
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> so that it would be mobile friendly.
