# Scrap Code Dump Blog

This was the first version of by blog hosted on Blogger. In 2015, I moved the blog from Blogger
to a dedicated site for a business that I was starting. That business idea did not succeed,
so I decided to take the existing content and make it part of my personal blog. Thus the current
website, The Almost Engineer, has this content.
