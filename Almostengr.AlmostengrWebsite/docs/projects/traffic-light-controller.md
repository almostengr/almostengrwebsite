## Purpose

Pupose of this project was to replace the Raspberry Pi traffic light controller
([Traffic Pi](/projects/traffic-pi)) that I had created. Problem with using a Raspberry Pi 
for projects like this is that the operating system has to be constantly updated. In addition, 
Pis are known for having issues when they are not properly shut down. To reduce the risk of 
having an unexpected failure, I decided to change replace the Pi with a controller that 
ran on an ESP32.

This controller will be sold as a product that model railroad and traffic light enthusiasts
will enjoy. To purchase, visit
