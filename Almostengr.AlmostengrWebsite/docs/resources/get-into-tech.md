As a follower of #BlackTechTwitter and participating in a number of tech related groups on Facebook, sometimes 
I see or get asked questions about how to get into tech. For some, they want to change careers from a non-tech 
career. For others, they are trying to get into tech and have little to no work experience. Below are a list of 
questions that I have been asked and the answers that I provide to people.

As I get asked more questions, I will update this page according with my answers to those questions. If you have
a question that is not answered here, you can reach out to me on

## General

### I want to get into tech. What role should I take?

Tech is a wide, like the ocean wide, industry. There are so many different types of roles that it is not possible
to advise one on which they should take. My suggestion is that you look to see what interests you the most. 
Then from there, you narrow those down, look at YouTubers that do that line of work and find people on LinkedIn
about the work that they do. From that point, you can then narrow your list down further to one option. 
Once you have that final option, then you can find online resources (online courses, YouTube series), 
books, conference workshops, and groups that relate to the work that you are interested in.

### What's the fastest way to get a job in tech?

Anytime someone asks this question or similar, it is blaintly obvious that they have no real interest in tech 
and are only trying to get in for the money. That being said, I tell people up front that if you are 
wanting to get into tech solely for the money and not because you have a passion for it, you will easily be 
found out and will not get hired. Having sat on the interviewer's side of the desk, these type of people are 
relatively easy to identify as they all have similar patterns or attributes. What are those patterns? 

* They are more concerned about how much money they will be paid and not really interested in the job duties.
* They do not have deep knowledge about the area of tech that they want to get into.
* They fail at doing technical interviews (e.g. answering basic questions relating to databases, or the 
difference between an int an double)

## Certifications

### I don't have a degree. Can I get into tech with only certifications?

Yes you can, but your path to getting a job may be more difficult. Common misconception is that you can get 
a tech certification (Security+, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure Cloud) and it will automatically get them 
qualified for the job. This is never the case. What I share with people is that when you interview, you have 
to demonstrate the knowledge that comes with the certification. Yes you can study for an exam, but can you put 
the knowledge that was on that exam into practice. If you cannot, then you will not get hired. 
Read the [previous question](#do-i-need-to-have-a-computer-science-or-tech-degree-to-get-into-tech) for 
further explaination.

### Which cloud certification(s) should I get?

That will vary. The certifications offered by the big three (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsft Azure) are all similar in nature, but 
specific to their particular implementation. What I tell people is, if you already have a job and your employer
has stuff in the cloud, then get the certification with whatever cloud provider(s) that they are using. If you 
do not have a job in tech, then find an employer that you want to work for, see what cloud technologies that they 
are using, and then get the certifications for that cloud provider.

### I have a certification(s) but I am not getting job offers or interviews. What can I do?

If you have a certification and do not have experience or have knowledge of IT concepts and best practices, 
then you will not get hired. The lack of these things are often evident based on your resume or based on
how well (or bad) you answer technical questions in an interview. One thing that I always tell people is that 
people who have experience, both on the job and personal projects, will get hired before those that do not 
have any experience. The reason is that if you have expeirence, then that demostrates and validates to the 
interviewer that you know what you are talking about. Companies are less likely to hire people that they 
will have to train, because training people does not add value to the company nor does it help make 
the company a profit.

## Degrees

### Do I need to have a Computer Science or tech degree to get into tech? 

No. I will say that having a Computer Science, Information Systems, or similar degree will 
grant you more employment opportunities than having a non-tech degree. Having a degree, regardless of what 
kind of degree, will make you better qualified for a tech job than having no degree at all.

A lot of jobs are requiring that you have a degree, and not necessarily a tech degree. Having been on
the interviewer side of the desk, the reason that degrees are required, but not necessarily a tech degree, 
is because a degree is proof that you have a certain level of compentencies to be able to do the job. In 
addition, those with degrees, regardless of the level of degree, are considered to be more mature, less likely 
to commit crime, and are more established than those who are not.

### I have a degree in a non-tech subject. How can I get a tech job?

This depends on what your degree is in. I have listed some examples below of people that have asked this question
and the positions that I thought would be best where they get a job in tech and leverage their existing degree.

* Individual has a Communications degrees (Bachelors and Masters). I suggested to her was to look into 
Business Analyst or Project Management roles. Reason being is both of these roles are usually customer facing and 
require that you present information (e.g. project progress, design features, questions from developers) to the 
product owner or customer. 
* Individual has a Nursing degree (Bachelors). I suggested that the individual consider working as a technican 
repairing and maintaining medical equipment (e.g. heart monitors, blood pressure machines, MRI machine, etc). 
Having a medical background would give them an advantage because they know how those machines should work and 
would only have to learn the technical aspect of the machines. In addition, having previously worked in a
hospital environment, they would already be familar with hospital procedures and protocols. 

## Programming 

### What programming language should I learn first? 

I suggest that people who are new to programming learn either C++, C#, or Java. I do not suggest that people start
learning Python or JavaScript as their first programming language. The reason being is that most large, enterprise
level organizations, are running applications that use C++, Java, or C# for their systems and back ends. Furthermore,
these three languages require that you learn the object oriented programming techniques and the data types. Python, 
JavaScript, and PHP don't require that you use data types when setting variables and allow you to get away with 
a lot of things that are not allowed in other languages. 

For example, in C, if you define a variable to be an 
integer (int) and try to set that variable to a string, the application will throw an error. In Python and JavaScript, 
it will allow you to set a string to variable that originally had a integer as a variable. Thus your application can 
end up with a bug that would later have to be fixed.
