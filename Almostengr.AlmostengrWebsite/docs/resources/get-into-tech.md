# Get Into Tech

As a follower of #BlackTechTwitter and participating in a number of tech related groups on Facebook, sometimes 
I see or get asked questions about how to get into tech. For some, they want to change careers from a non-tech 
career. For others, they are trying to get into tech and have little to no work experience. Below are a list of 
questions that I have been asked and the answers that I provide to people.

As I get asked more questions, I will update this page according with my answers to those questions. If you have
a question that is not answered here, you can reach out to me on

## General

### I want to get into tech. What role should I take?

Tech is a wide, like the ocean wide, industry. There are so many different types of roles that it is not possible
to advise one on which they should take. My suggestion is that you look to see what interests you the most. 
Then from there, you narrow those down, look at YouTubers that do that line of work and find people on LinkedIn
about the work that they do. From that point, you can then narrow your list down further to one option. 
Once you have that final option, then you can find online resources (online courses, YouTube series), 
books, conference workshops, and groups that relate to the work that you are interested in.

## Degrees and Certifications

### Do I need to have a Computer Science or tech degree to get into tech? 

No. I will say that having a Computer Science, Information Systems, or similar degree will 
grant you more employment opportunities than having a non-tech degree. Having a degree, regardless of what 
kind of degree, will make you better qualified for a tech job than having no degree at all.

A lot of jobs are requiring that you have a degree, and not necessarily a tech degree. Having been on
the interviewer side of the desk, the reason that degrees are required, but not necessarily a tech degree, 
is because a degree is proof that you have a certain level of compentencies to be able to do the job. In 
addition, those with degrees, regardless of the level of degree, are considered to be more mature, less likely 
to commit crime, and are more established than those who are not.

### I don't have a degree. Can I get into tech with only certifications?

Yes you can, but your path to getting a job may be more difficult. Common misconception is that you can get 
a tech certification (Security+, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure Cloud) and it will automatically get them 
qualified for the job. This is never the case. What I share with people is that when you interview, you have 
to demonstrate the knowledge that comes with the certification. Yes you can study for an exam, but can you put 
the knowledge that was on that exam into practice. If you cannot, then you will not get hired. 
Read the [previous question](#do-i-need-to-have-a-computer-science-or-tech-degree-to-get-into-tech) for 
further explaination.

## Programming 

### What programming language should I learn first? 

I suggest that people who are new to programming learn either C++, C#, or Java. I do not suggest that people start
learning Python or JavaScript as their first programming language. The reason being is that most large, enterprise
level organizations, are running applications that use C++, Java, or C# for their systems and back ends. Furthermore,
these three languages require that you learn the object oriented programming techniques and the data types. Python, 
JavaScript, and PHP don't require that you use data types when setting variables and allow you to get away with 
a lot of things that are not allowed in other languages. 

For example, in C, if you define a variable to be an 
integer (int) and try to set that variable to a string, the application will throw an error. In Python and JavaScript, 
it will allow you to set a string to variable that originally had a integer as a variable. Thus your application can 
end up with a bug that would later have to be fixed.
