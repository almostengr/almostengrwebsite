Since first learning how to code in 2002, holding various part- and full-time paid positions since 2008, 
a follower of #BlackTechTwitter on 
<a href="https://twitter.com/almostengr" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, 
and participating in a number of tech related groups on Facebook, sometimes 
I see or get asked questions about how to get into tech. For some, they want to change careers from a non-tech 
career. For others, they are trying to get into tech and have little to no work experience. 

I decided to compile the questions that I get asked about getting into tech or changing from non-tech role 
to a tech role into the resource that you see here.
As I get asked more questions, I will update this page with my answers to those questions. If you have
a question that is not answered here, you can reach out to me on

## General

### I want to get into tech. What role should I take?

Tech is a big, wide industry. Like big as the ocean wide.
There are so many different types of roles and way to get into tech, that there is no one answer to this 
question. My suggestion is that you look to see what interests you the most. 
Then from there, you narrow those down, look at YouTubers that do that line of work and find people on LinkedIn
about the work that they do. From that point, you can then narrow your list down further to one option. 
Once you have that final option, then you can find online resources (online courses, YouTube series), 
books, conference workshops, and groups that relate to the work that you are interested in.

### What's the fastest way to get a job in tech?

Anytime someone asks this question or similar, it is clearly obvious that they have no real interest in tech 
and are only trying to get in for the money. That being said, I tell people up front that if you are 
wanting to get into tech solely for the money and not because you have a passion for it, you will easily be 
found out and will not get hired. Having sat on the interviewer's side of the desk, these type of people are 
relatively easy to identify as they all have similar patterns or attributes. What are those patterns? 

* They are more concerned about how much money they will be paid and not really interested in the job duties.
* They do not have deep knowledge about the area of tech that they want to get into.
* They fail at technical interviews (e.g. unable to answer basic questions relating to databases, or the 
difference between an int an double)

### I want a work from home (WFH) role.

While work from home roles sprung up a lot more during the COVID-19 Pandemic, working from home can be 
worse for some people. Below are my pros, cons, and suggestions for working from home. Consider these before
accepting a role that allows you to work from home full-time.

#### Pros

* Save money on gas, car maintenance by not having a commute
* Do not have to spend money on work-specific clothes
* Gives you more time to do other things because you are not sitting in traffic
* Allows your kids to remain a home during the day instead of sending them off to daycare, thus saving money

#### Cons

* Extroverts can become depressed due to the lack of social interaction, especially if they live alone.
* More distractions (e.g. kids crying, tv on, making dinner, convenience for midday naps) can cause your
work to suffer or you to miss deadlines.
* Increased electrical usage. Since you are home more, your utilities are more than likely to go up.

#### Suggestions

* Have a dedicated work space (e.g. home office). When you "clock out" for the day, leave that work space and power off your computer.
* Take walks or exercise outside when weather permits. Lack of sunlight is known to contribute to depression and Vitamin D deficiency.
* Do not work in the same clothes that you sleep in. This is easy to do, especially if your company culture 
is to not turn on cameras in meetings, but refrain from doing this as mentally it blurs the lines between 
work and non-work times.
* Let other members of your household know that when you are in your work space, to keep interruptions 
to a minimum.
* If you get to a point where always being at home is having a negative impact physically or mentally, 
then seek professional help or find a role that requires you to leave the home.

### I want to get into tech, but have prior convictions. What can I do?

<a href="https://underdogdevs.org/" target="_blank">Underdog Devs</a> 
is a program that is designed for those 
who have prior convictions or come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are trying to get into tech. You are 
partnered with a mentor and given tasks to complete each week. I know someone personally that signed up 
for this program and he said that it has helped him a lot, in particular with his confidence with him 
getting a job in tech and motivated him to work on his tech skills.

## Certifications

### I don't have a degree. Can I get into tech with only certifications?

Yes you can, but your path to getting a job may be more difficult. Common misconception is that you can get 
a tech certification (Security+, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure Cloud) and it will automatically get them 
qualified for the job. This is never the case. What I share with people is that when you interview, you have 
to demonstrate the knowledge that comes with the certification. Yes, you can study for an exam, but can you put 
the knowledge that was on that exam into practice. If you cannot, then you will not get hired. 
Read the [previous question](#do-i-need-to-have-a-computer-science-or-tech-degree-to-get-into-tech) for 
further explanation.

### Which cloud certification(s) should I get?

That will vary. The certifications offered by the big three (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) are all similar in nature, but 
specific to their particular implementation. What I tell people is, if you already have a job and your employer
has stuff in the cloud, then get the certification with whatever cloud provider(s) that they are using. If you 
do not have a job in tech, then find an employer that you want to work for, see what cloud technologies that they 
are using, and then get the certifications for that cloud provider.

### I have a certification(s) but I am not getting job offers or interviews. What can I do?

If you have a certification and do not have experience or have knowledge of IT concepts and best practices, 
then you will not get hired. The lack of these things are often evident based on your resume or based on
how well (or bad) you answer technical questions in an interview. One thing that I always tell people is that 
people who have experience, both on the job and personal projects, will get hired before those that do not 
have any experience. The reason is that if you have experience, then that demonstrates and validates to the 
interviewer that you know what you are talking about. Companies are less likely to hire people that they 
will have to train, because training people does not add value to the company nor does it help make 
the company a profit.

### Should I list my certifications on my resume and LinkedIn?

Yes, if they are relevant to the work to the job that you have or want to have. Having a food handler certification 
is irrelevant to being a network engineer, thus would not make sense to list this on your resume or LinkedIn.
Having AWS certification listed when going for a Azure cloud position is relevant, although they are 
different technologies, and should be listed on your resume.

### I don't have the money to spend on a certification or practice materials. What should I do?

Consider the money that you spend on getting a certification as an investment on yourself. That being said, 
do not go cheap on yourself. Any investment that you make in yourself, will get you better opportunities if 
done correctly.

Depending on which certification that you are going for, sometimes there are vouchers available that will reduce 
or eliminate the cost of the exam and/or study materials. Check with the certificate issuer about any 
vouchers or other offers they have to reduce the expenditure for taking the certification exams.

## Degrees

### Do I need to have a Computer Science or tech degree to get into tech? 

No. I will say that having a Computer Science, Information Systems, or similar degree will 
grant you more employment opportunities than having a non-tech degree. Having a degree, regardless of what 
kind of degree, will make you better qualified for a tech job than having no degree at all.

A lot of jobs are requiring that you have a degree, and not necessarily a tech degree. Having been on
the interviewer side of the desk, the reason that degrees are required, but not necessarily a tech degree, 
is because a degree is proof that you have a certain level of competencies to be able to do the job. In 
addition, those with degrees, regardless of the level of degree, are considered to be more mature, less likely 
to commit crime, and are more established than those who are not.

### I have a degree in a non-tech subject. How can I get a tech job?

This depends on what your degree is in. I have listed some examples below of people that have asked this question
and the positions that I thought would be best where they get a job in tech and leverage their existing degree.

* Individual has a Communications degrees (Bachelors and Masters). I suggested that she look into 
Business Analyst or Project Management roles. Reason being is both of these roles are usually customer facing and 
require that you present information (e.g. project progress, design features, questions from developers) to the 
product owner or customer. 
* Individual has a Nursing degree (Bachelors). I suggested that the individual consider working as a technician  
repairing and maintaining medical equipment (e.g. heart monitors, blood pressure machines, MRI machine, etc). 
Also suggested that this individual consider working for an MSP (Managed Service Provider) that contracts or 
provides services to hospitals. 
Having a medical background would give them an advantage because they know how those machines should work and 
would only have to learn the technical aspect of the machines. In addition, having previously worked in a
hospital environment, they would already be familiar with hospital procedures and protocols. 

## Linux

### There are multiple distributions of Linux like Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Fedora. Which one should I pick to learn with?

It does not matter, but do pick one that is free and not paid.
Some distributions of Linux, like Red Hat, require that you pay for them, simliar to how Microsoft requires that you 
pay for a Windows OS license. I do not recommend paying for any distribution of Linux that you will be practicing with. 
Majority of Linux distributions, do not require that you pay for them as they are open source.
From my experience, Ubuntu is one of the easiest to install a on system or virtual machine.

### I have installed a Linux VM (Virtual Machine) and use the GUI (graphical user interface) to practice with.

You are doing it wrong. I suggest that you install the server edition of Linux (does not matter what 
distribution of Linux) which does not have a graphical 
user interface (GUI). Reason being is that servers that are used by AWS and any enterprise, do not have a 
graphical interface because the GUI takes up additional system resources that could be used by the application, 
database, firewall, or something else. In addition, by not having the GUI available, it will force you to 
learn how to do things only using the terminal or command line.

### I hate using vi or vim. I prefer nano or gedit.

I always tell people that while vi or vim can be difficult to use, every Linux and Unix based system that I have 
used either had vi or vim. All of them **did not** have nano or gedit or any other text editing program. While you 
can have your favorite, having basic knowledge of how to edit a text file in vi or vim will allow you edit files 
on any Linux based system even if your favorite editor is not available.

## Programming 

### What programming language should I learn first? 

I suggest that people who are new to programming learn either C++, C#, or Java. I do not suggest that people start
learning Python or JavaScript as their first programming language. The reason being is that most large, enterprise
level organizations, are running applications that use C++, Java, or C# for their systems and back ends. Furthermore,
these three languages require that you learn the object-oriented programming techniques and the data types. Python, 
JavaScript, and PHP don't require that you use data types when setting variables and allow you to get away with 
a lot of things that are not allowed in other languages. 

For example, in C, if you define a variable to be an 
integer (int) and try to set that variable to a string, the application will throw an error. In Python and JavaScript, 
it will allow you to set a string to variable that originally had an integer as a variable. Thus your application can 
end up with a bug that would later have to be fixed.

### Python is talked about so much. I should learn that because it has a lot of uses right?

While it is true that a lot of YouTubers talk about how they have built programs and automations with Python, 
from my experience, I have never ever have had to use Python in my career. That being said, do not 
believe the hype about Python because it could lead you down the wrong path. Python does have its use case 
in certain environments and use cases, 
but larger corporations and governments are not going to convert all of their enterprise applications
to Python because a number of people are talking about Python. 

What I tell people is that larger, more established companies do not use Python in their applications. They are
most likely using C# or Java for those. Smaller companies and start ups are more likely to use Python because
it is easier to code with and is not as rigid as strongly typed languages like C# and Java.

### What all do I need to know as a programmer?

This will vary depending on who you work for, but there are some core compentencies that you will need to know
that are universal. 

* CI/CD - Continuous Integration, Continuous Development
* Programming best practices and concepts - clean code, SOLID, DRY
* Programming language - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web development; Java, C# for desktop applications
* SCRUM and Agile concepts
* Version control - Git is the most popular source control system
