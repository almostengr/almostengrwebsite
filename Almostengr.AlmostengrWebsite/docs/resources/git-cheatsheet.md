# Git Cheat Sheet
Cheatsheet of commands to use when working with git. This is a quick reference for the commands that are most commonly used when working with Git.

A description of what each command does if executed, is provided under each command.

## Commands

```bash
git init
```
Creates a new repository in the current directory. 

```bash
git branch
```
Lists all of the branches that are in the current branch. 

```bash
git add .
```
Stages all of the files for commit in the current and subirectories.

```bash
git add -u
```
Stages all of the previously commited files in the current and subdirectories.

```bash
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
Commits the changes made to files, removal of files from the repo, and addition of files to the repo. 
```MESSAGE``` should be replaced with a details of the changes made since the last commit.

```bash
git clone REPOURL
```
Makes a copy of the repository from Github to your local computer. This allows for changes to be made 
from your local computer. ```REPOURL``` should be replaced with the URL from the remote repository.

```bash
git status
```
Shows the current branch, files that have added but not committed, files that have been removed but not 
committed, files that have not been staged for committing. 

```bash
git rm FILENAME
```
Removes files from the repository. If removing directories, "-r" option needs to be used. Replace 
```FILENAME``` with the name of the actual file. 

```bash
git diff --cached COMMITHASH
```
Shows the changes that have been made between a previous commit and the files pending commitment. 
If no files have been staged for commit, then this command will not return any output.  
```COMMITHASH``` should be replaced with the unique identifer of a previous commit.

```bash
git diff --cached $(git log | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
```
Performs the same command above, but automatically gets the latest commit from the ```git log``` 
command. This command will only work on Unix or Linux based systems.

```bash
git diff $(git log | head -1 | awk '{print $2}') $(git log | head -7 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}')
```
Shows the changes between the latest commit and the previous commit by pulling the commit hash from 
```git log``` command.  This command will only work on Unix or Linux based systems.

```bash
git log
```
Shows the commit history. This include the commit message, date, time, author, and commit ID (or hash). 

```bash
git clean
```
Removes files that are not being tracked.

```bash
git push origin BRANCH
```
Pushes files from the origin branch to the git server that hosts the repository.  ```BRANCH``` should 
be replaced with the name of the branch, although it does not have to be specified. if ```BRANCH``` is 
not entered, then the current branch will be pushed.

```bash
git pull origin BRANCH
```
Pulls the latest version of the branch from your git server. ```BRANCH``` should be replaced with the 
name of the branch, although it does not have to be specified.

```bash
git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm
```
Deletes the local files that have already been removed from the git repo.

```bash
git branch | grep -v master | xargs git branch -D 
```
Deletes all of the local branches except master. Useful for when multiple remote branches have been removed and you need to remove the local corresponding branches.
