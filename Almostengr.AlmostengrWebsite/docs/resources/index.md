# Resources

Here are some resources that you may find beneficial. My goal is to share the knowledge that I have 
with others in hopes that that will pass it forward like I have done. This list will be updated as I find 
and create resources related to programming and working in IT (Information Technology). Some of the 
links are resources that I have used myself. Each of the links go to a person in tech, tech related group, 
or tech related organization.

Additional resources nad suggestions can be added to this list by messaging me on 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/almostengr" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/almostengr" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
