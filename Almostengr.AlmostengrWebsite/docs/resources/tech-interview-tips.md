Having sat on both sides of the interview desk, there are certain things that I have learned 
and have created this resource to share those details. They are in no particular order.

## Preparation

### Do make sure your entire outfit matches, including your socks.

I once did a mock interview session for some students. I went into the waiting room, called 
the next interviewee, and as he got up something stood out to me about his attire. 
He had on gym socks, which did not match his shirt and tie attire.

Granted his socks would be covered by his pants when walking or standing, I saw his socks 
while he was still sitting down in the waiting area. In the feedback portion of the interview, 
I mentioned that his socks were ready to go to the gym or play sports but the rest of him 
was ready for an interview. He explained why that was the case, but I shared with him that those 
minor things could result in him not getting the job because it demonstrates a lack of detail.

## Questions

## I don't know the answer to a question. Should I wing it or should I say that I don't know?

It is best for you to say that you don't know. You are probably thinking that it is bad that 
you don't know something, but 

If you wing the answer, and wing it incorrectly, 
then it becomes more evident that you do not know what you are talking about or lack the 
knowledge in the subject being asked.
