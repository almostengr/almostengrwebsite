On March 1, 2020, I will be hosting a Linux training.

This training is free. For more information and to register, please visit
the event page.

This event is designed to get more people familiar with Linux OS and Kernel since
it is a highly demand skill in the tech industry. You do not have to have any
experience but I do suggest you to bring your laptop and enjoy yourself.
