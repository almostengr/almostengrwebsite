# Power On Wemo Switch After Power Failure with Home Assistant

## Summary

This tutorial shows you how to power on a Wemo switch after a power failure. 

When a power failure occurs, the Wemo switch will default to the Off state. I'm using the Wemo switch to be able to remotely restart the router if I have internet connection issues.  

A power failure recently occurred before shooting this video. This resulted in the internet connection being down until I was able to return home and turn on the switch. 

By having Home Assistant switch on the modem after all connections and power has been restored, I don't have to worry about not being able to access my network remotely after a power failure.
