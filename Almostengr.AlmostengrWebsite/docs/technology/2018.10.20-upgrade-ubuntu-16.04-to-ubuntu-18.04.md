UPGRADE YOUR ABOUT TO 1604 LTS SERVER
ADDITION TO A BUN TO 18.04 LTS SERVER
ADDITION EVERY TWO YEARS
UBUNTU RELEASES AN LTS OR LONG TERM
SUPPORT ADDITION OF THEIR OPERATING
SYSTEM THE LTS ADDITIONS ARE SUPPORTED
FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR RELEASE
THIS IS BENEFICIAL AS A BUN TO OS HAS AN
UPDATE EVERY SIX MONTHS WHICH OCCURS IN
APRIL AND OCTOBER THE FINAL VERSION OF
UBUNTU 18.04 WAS RELEASED ON APRIL 28
2018 TODAY I'M GOING TO UPGRADE MY
DEVELOPMENT SERVER TO THE 1804 VERSION
THE COMMANDS THAT ARE USED IN THIS VIDEO
WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE DESCRIPTION
BELOW IT WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE AS A
SHELL SCRIPT FROM A GITHUB REPOSITORY
THE LINK TO THE REPOSITORY WILL ALSO BE
IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW TO BEGIN YOU'LL
NEED TO OPEN A TERMINAL WINDOW AND SINCE
I'M RUNNING THIS FROM A VIRTUAL MACHINE
I AM GOING TO USE THE TERMINAL WINDOW
THAT IS CONNECTED TO THAT VIRTUAL
MACHINE AND SO THE FIRST COMMAND I'M
GOING TO RUN IS LSB UNDERSCORE RELEASE -
A AND THAT WILL SHOW THAT I AM RUNNING
UBUNTU AND THAT I AM RUNNING THE 16.04
RELEASE OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM NEXT I'M
GOING TO UPGRADE THE OS - AND HIS
PACKAGES TO THE LATEST VERSION TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE HAVE ANY LAST-MINUTE
CHANGES THAT MAY NEED TO BE DONE ARE
ALSO PULLED IN SO TO DO THAT I'M GOING
TO RUN SUDO APT-GET UPDATE AND THEN SUDO
APT-GET UPGRADE AS ONE COMMAND WITH THE
DASH Y OPTION AFTER UPGRADE AND IF
PROMPTED ENTER YOUR PASSWORD FOR SUDO
AND NOW THAT THAT HAS COMPLETED YOU WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ALSO USING A
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUCH AS
GIT OR EVEN SUBVERSION THAT WAY IF YOU
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH YOUR CONFIGURATION
FILES YOU CAN RESTORE THOSE FILES BACK
TO THE SYSTEM AND THEN REBOOT YOUR
SYSTEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE
CONFIGURATION FILES YOU'LL END UP HAVING
TO REINSTALL THE OS FROM SCRATCH AND SET
UP EVERYTHING ELSE FROM SCRATCH I HAVE
ANOTHER TUTORIAL THAT SHOWS YOU HOW TO
SET UP THE SC DIRECTORY AS WELL AS ANY
OTHER DIRECTORY WITH GIT OR ANY OTHER
VERSIONING SOFTWARE TO CONTINUE ON THE
NEXT YOU'LL NEED TO RUN THE UPGRADE
COMMAND WHICH IS SUDO DO - RELEASE -
UPGRADE AND IT WILL GO AND CHECK FOR THE
LATEST ABUN TO RELEASE US AVAILABLE TO
BE DOWNLOAD AND THEN IT WILL DOWNLOAD
THAT VERSION YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
HAVE A STABLE INTERNET CONNECTION IF YOU
DON'T HAVE A STABLE IN CONNECTION THE
INSTALL OR UPGRADE WILL FAIL THIS WILL
TAKE SOME TIME TO COMPLETE IF THERE ARE
ANY CONFLICTS WITH THE CONFIGURATION
FILES THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE THE SYSTEM
WILL MANUALLY PROMPT YOU FOR HOW TO
RESOLVE THOSE AFTER THE UPDATE HAS
COMPLETED YOU'LL NEED TO RESTART YOUR
COMPUTER IF IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY
RESTART WANTS TO COME BACK ONLINE CHECK
THAT YOU HAVE THE LATEST OS INSTALLED BY
RERUNNING THE COMMAND
SO I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
INSTALLED OF MY SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR
WEBMIN IS ONE OF THOSE ADDITIONAL
PACKAGES THAT IS FINDING THE SOURCE LIST
AND IT WON'T CONTINUE UNLESS I GIVE IT
PERMISSION TO DO SO SINCE IT'S ASKING
FOR CONFIRMATION SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO
AHEAD AND HIT ENTER SO THEY CAN CONTINUE
ON
AS YOU SEE HERE I'VE REACHED A PROMPT
WHERE IT HAS CHECKED ALL THE PACKAGES
THAT ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLED ON A SYSTEM
AND THE NEW PACKAGES THAT WILL NEED TO
BE INSTALLED AS PART OF THE UPGRADE AS
YOU SEE SAYS THERE ARE THREE POCKETS
THAT ARE NO LONGER POOR TIT SO THOSE
WILL BE PROBABLY BE REMOVED THERE ARE
FIVE PACKAGES THAT ARE CLEARLY GOING TO
BE REMOVED
147 PACKAGES THAT WILL BE INSTALLED AND
555 PACKAGES THAT WILL BE AN UPGRADED
THERE WILL BE A DOWNLOAD TOTAL OF FOUR
HUNDRED AND EIGHT MEGABYTES THIS
DOWNLOAD WILL TAKE ABOUT 51 MINUTES
BASED ON A ONE MEGABYTE DSL CONNECTION
AND ABOUT FIVE HOURS WITH THE 56K MODEM
I CURRENTLY HAVE A 100 MEGABIT
CONNECTION SO BASED UPON THIS
CALCULATION THAT IT HAS ALREADY DONE
THAT SHOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY FIVE
MINUTES AS IT STATES THIS PROCESS CAN
TAKE SEVERAL HOURS HOWEVER ONCE IT'S
DONE IT IS DONE SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD
AND CONTINUE BY ENTERING IN Y AND
PRESSING ENTER AND I WAS SHORTENED THE
SEQUENCE OF THIS ALTHOUGH THE FULL
SEQUENCE WILL BE POSTED IN ANOTHER VIDEO
NOW THAT THE UPGRADE TO ABOUT TEEN 18.04
HAS COMPLETED WE WILL LOG BACK IN AND AS
YOU SEE ON THE LOGIN SCREEN IT ACTUALLY
MENTIONS THAT THIS IS THE 18.04 VERSION
SO YOU LOG IN WITH YOUR SAME CREDENTIALS
THAT YOU USED BEFORE
AND WASH YOU DO GET LOGGED BACK INTO THE
SYSTEM YOU'LL WANT TO RUN SUDO APT-GET
UPDATE SUDO APT-GET UPGRADE WITH DASH Y
AT THE END AND I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING
WHY AM I UPGRADING THE SYSTEM WHEN I
JUST INSTALLED THE LATEST VERSION OF THE
OS THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
THEY PACKAGE THE OS THAT THE LATEST
VERSION OF THE PACKAGES ARE NOT INCLUDED
IN THAT LATEST RELEASE CODE VERSION SO
AFTER YOU DO THE INSTALLATION OF THE
OPERATING SYSTEM YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE
SURE YOU GO BACK TO GET THOSE PACKAGE
UPDATES AS WELL THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED
SINCE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE
OPERATING SYSTEM AND AS YOU SEE IT'S
PROMPTING THAT I HAVE A PACKAGE THAT
IT'S NO LONGER NEEDED AND SO I CAN
REMOVE THAT AS WELL SO I CAN USE SUDO
APT-GET AUTO REMOVE NOW USE THE PURGE
OPTION AND THEN I USE PHP CONSOLE -
TABLE AND I DON'T USE THAT'S WHY ON THIS
ONE AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU REMOVE ONE
PACKAGE IT WILL HAVE A BUNCH OF
DEPENDENCIES THAT WILL ALSO BE REMOVED
AND IF YOU USE THE - Y OPTION IT WILL
REMOVE THOSE WITHOUT PROMPTING SINCE
THIS IS THE ONLY PACKAGE THAT IS GOING
TO REMOVE I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO CONTINUE
ALRIGHT NEXT I'M GOING TO GO TO MY ETSY
DIRECTORY AND SINCE I HAVE THE
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT MAINTAINED ON
THIS PARTICULAR SERVER I'M GOING TO RUN
GET STATUS ON HERE AND SINCE THE ETSY
DIRECTORY IS OWNED BY ROOT I HAVE TO USE
THE SUDO COMMAND IN FRONT OF THE GET
STATUS AND SO IT SAYS ITS UPDATE WITH
THE LATEST VERSION HOWEVER I'M NOT FULLY
SURE ABOUT THAT SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD
AND SWITCH THIS WITH THE ROOT USER BY
USING SUDO SU AND THEN OUR AND GET
STATUS AGAIN AND IT SAYS IT IS UPDATED
WITH THE LATEST VERSION SO I WILL DO GIT
ADD AND IN PERIOD AND THAT WILL ADD ANY
NEW FILES IN HERE AND WILL ALSO ADD ANY
EXISTING FILES THEN I WILL RUN GIT
STATUS AND THERE ARE NO NEW FILES THIS
