Below are the notes that I took from this online presentation with 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ardalis" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a>. This presentation was done
very early into the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to learn more about C# and the .NET Core framework, 
I found that this event was happening on
<a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">Meetup</a>. So I decided to attend. You can also join 
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/The-SLC-NET-User-Group/" target="_blank">The SLC .NET User Group</a> on Meetup.

## Applying Clean Architecture to ASP.NET Core

April 9, 2020

## separation of concerns

* dont let your plumbing code pollute your software
* avoid mixing different code responsibilties in the same method, class or project

### the big three

* data access
* business rules and domain model
* user interface

## single responsibiity

* avoid tightly coupling your tools together
* works in tandem with Separation of Concenrs
* class should focus on single responsibily; should only have one reason to change

## Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY)

* put repetitive code into functions
* group functions into cohesive classes; dealing with the same responsbility
* group classes by folders and namespaces by responsibiltiy, level of
abstraction, etc
* further group class folders into projects

## Dependency Inversion

* Would you solder a lamp directly into the electrical wiring in a wall?

## invert (and inject) dependencies

* both high level classes and implementation-detail classes should depend
on abstractions (interfaces); should not be hard coded
* classes should follow explicit dependencies principle; classes should be explicit
about all of the classes that they need; dependencies are defined in the class constructor
* make your types honest, not deceptive
* dont have a constructor with a lot of dependencies. consider using additional
classes if this is the case
* advised not to use property dependency injection

### abstractions/inferfaces must be defined somewhere accessible by
* low level implemetnation services
* high level business services
* user interface entry points; usually done in configure services

## Dependency Graphs

### Direct Dependency Graph

* Class A -> Class B -> Class C

### Inverted dpedency graph

* Class A -> Inteface B -> Class B -> Interface C -> Class C
* this allows the actual class to be swapped out and easier to test

## Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard

* UI classes shouldnt depend on infrastructure classes (file system, database, external resources, etc)
* how can we strcuture our solution to help enforce this?
* business / domain classes shouldnt depend on infrastructure classes
* avoid repeating or copy pasting (DRY)

## Class N Tier Architecture (or N Layer)

* originally, everything was in the same layer (Classical)
* over time, that changed to N-tier where each layer is separated

### Transitive dependencies

* this resulted in everything on the database because the top layer depended
on the later below it
* this mean that the database had to be reset each time the tests were ran

## domain-centric design

* better than data centric design

### domain model

* model of the problem that exists of entities, interfaces, services, and more
* should be able to work independent of the database
* interfaces define contracts for work with domain objects
* everything in the application (including infrasctrucutre and data access) depends
on these interfaces and domain objects

## clean architecture (aka Onion Architecture)

* each layer points to the inside layer
* the domain entities at the center; they should be protected from being coupled;
it makes things easier to test
* the middle circles are what everything depends on; outer circles are other services
and depend on the things in the middle

* domain model represents the entities and abstractions; not the repository thought,
just the interface

## clean architecture "rules"

* application core contains the domain model
* all projects depends on the core project; dependencies point inward to the
application core
* inner projects define intefaces; outer projects implement them (like infrastructure)
* abstraction lives in core; impementation lives in outter
* avoid direct depednecy on the infrastructure project (except from integration
test and possbily startup.cs); controllers should not be using things from the infrastructure
* framework independent
* database independent
* UI independent
* it is very testable
* everything knows about core

## refactoring to a clean architecture

* best: start from properly configured project
* next best: start from single application project
* most difficult: large, existing investment in multilayer architecture

## the core project (domain)

Minimal dependencies - none on infrastructure
What goes in it

* interfaces
* entities, value objects, aggregates
* domain services
* custom exceptions
* domain events
* event handlers
* specifications

## infrastructure project

all dependencies on out of process resources

* repositories
* ef core, dbcontext
* cached repositories
* web api clients
* file system
* logging
* email / sms sending
* system clock
* other services
* interfaces (sometimes; these are for the ones that depends on infrastructure stuff)

## web project 

* controllers 
* views 
* view models (or api models, or binding models)
* filters 
* binders 
* tag / html helpers 
* other services 
* interfaces (that depend on UI stuff)

## shared kernel 

* items that are shared between multiple solutions 
* referenced by the core projects
* ideally distributed as nuget packages 

# solution structure - clean architecture

functional test -> web 
web -> infrastructure 
web -> core 
infrastructure -> core 
unit tests -> core 
integration tests -> infrastructure 
core -> shared kernel 


## how to keep controllers smaller 

* dont use a lot of logic in them; especially if it is not UI related 
* accept a type (view model, api model) 
* perform model validation 
* do work 
* create model required for response 
* return with result type (view, page, ok, not found)

### do work 

* get entity from injected repository 
* work with the entity and its methods 
* update the entitys state using the repository
