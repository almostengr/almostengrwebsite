WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANKS TO YOU
FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO AND IN THIS
VIDEO I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE
CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST IN YOUR CIVI
CRM INSTALLATION ON WORDPRESS HERE WE GO
[MUSIC]
ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK SO IF YOU'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS VIDEO SERIES OF
ME MOVING MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS
YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE PROGRESSION THAT
I'VE GOTTEN TO AS FAR AS CONVERTING THE
EXISTING SITE OVER IT'S A WORDPRESS
MOVING CONTENT AND SO FORTH ONE FEATURE
I WANT TO ADD IS TO HAVE A MAILING LIST
FUNCTIONALITY ON MY WEBSITE AND SO IN
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO
USE CP CRM I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING WHY DID
I NOT USE LIKE A MAILCHIMP OR SOME OTHER
SIMILAR TYPE OF SERVICE THAT HAS THIS
FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE I DID THINK
ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO
WHEN YOU'RE USING THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES
ONE OF WHICH IS COST SO USUALLY THERE IS
A THRESHOLD OF ONCE YOU HIT THAT
THRESHOLD YOU HAVE TO START PAYING ALSO
THEY HAVE YOUR DATA AND SO IF YOU WANT
TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT THEY CAN CHANGE
THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN POINT AND
SAY WELL TO PAY TO GET YOUR DATA YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW SO IT'S
EASIER TO COME OUT HOST YOUR OWN THINGS
USING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OFF THE
SHELF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND
THAT'S WHY I'M USING SEVERE CRM FOR THAT
PARTICULAR PURPOSE SO AS I DISCUSSED IN
LAST VIDEO SEVERE CRM IS DESIGNED FOR
NONPROFITS HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE SOME USE
CASES FOR
STUFF OUTSIDE OF A NONPROFIT ARENA ALL
RIGHT SO SWITCHING OVER TO THE COMPUTER
I DID INSTALL SUPER CRM IN MY LAST VIDEO
SO IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THAT GO BACK AND
WATCH THAT THERE WILL BE A PLAYLIST TO
ALL THE VIDEOS OF THIS WEBSITE
CONVERSION SERIES DOWN IN THE
DESCRIPTION BELOW SO WHEN YOU GO INTO
CIVIC CRM FROM THE DASHBOARD THERE IS A
OPTION TO DO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST
WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND SO YOU CLICK THAT
IT BRINGS YOU TO A LIST OF ITEMS ON YOUR
CIVI CRM INSTALLED AND SO WHAT I
NORMALLY DO IS WHEN I'M SETTING UP A
CIVIC CRM INSTALLATION I START FROM THE
TOP AND JUST WORK MY WAY DOWN AND MAKE
SURE I HIT EVERY SCREEN EVEN IF I'M NOT
CHANGING ANY SCREENS I JUST MAKE SURE I
JUST GO DOWN A LIST AND COVER EVERYTHING
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS
LIST I BUY - I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I
DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR
SCREEN BUT IT'S THERE SO I'M GONNA START
FROM THE TOP WE HAVE LOCALIZATION
ALRIGHT AND SO HERE WE SET THE LANGUAGE
I'M GONNA CHANGE THIS DEFAULT EXCUSE ME
INHERITS EMS LANGUAGE WHICH IS CONTENT
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - YES AND THE DEFAULT
LANGUAGE WILL SET THAT AS A SITE
LANGUAGE AS WELL CURRENCY I AM IN THE
UNITED STATES SO I WANT TO USE USD AND
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE AVAILABLE ONES - USD
I'M NOT SURE HOW WILL THEN WILL CONVERT
BUT YOU KNOW IF I'M USING SOME KIND OF
PAYMENTS
I BELIEVE PAYPAL WILL HANDLE THAT PRETTY
WELL SO NO CONCERN IS THERE MY DEFAULT
COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES SO
I'M GOING TO SET THAT THERE AND THE
DEFAULT PROVINCE I BELIEVE THAT ONE
BLANK FOR THE CONTACT ADDRESS FIELD SO I
WANT TO DO THE AVAILABLE COUNTRIES ARE
CANADA AND GOING TO DO UNITED STATES
OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO DO THE COUNTRY
THAT YOUR HAND AND SPACE AND PROMISES
YOU GOT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THOSE
SO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES AND
YOU'RE ABLE TO JUMP AROUND HERE BY USING
THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD I KNOW YOU
CAN'T SEE THAT BUT LIKE I WANTED TO GO
TO A COUNTRY THAT STARTED WITH L I JUST
TYPE SELECT AND CHECK IN THE BOX AND
THEN HIT L ON THE KEYBOARD AND YOU CAN
EVEN TYPE OUT THE NAME IN HERE AND IT'LL
JUMP DOWN TO THAT ALRIGHT AND ENABLE
MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I WILL IN DUE TIME
BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S
NECESSARY ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING IS THE
ORGANIZATION ADDRESS AND CONTACT
INFORMATION SO THIS IS LIKE I SAY IT IS
DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS THE OXYGENATOR
OKAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR
LIKE YOU KNOW BUILT BUSINESSES THAT I'M
SORRY I'LL PUT THE WRONG THING THERE
ONCE YOU PUT A MAIN STREET HERE AND A
CITY AND MAKE UP A ZIP CODE AND THERE
ARE NO COUNTIES FOR THE UNITED STATES
I DON'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY HAS CREATED A
COMPONENT FOR THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE
COUNTIES FOR OTHER LOCATIONS MORE SO
OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FOR THE MOST PART
IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN THE UNITED
STATES LIKE I AM THIS WILL BE BLANK AND
LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE ORGANIZATION
CONTACT INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW EMAIL
ADDRESS EAR AND
IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION PUT THAT IN
THERE AND SO THAT INFORMATION WILL
ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN THE EMAILS THAT YOU
SEND OUT ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE
LIST IS THE ENABLE CIVIC CRM COMPONENTS
I AM ONLY GOING TO BE USING MAIL RIGHT
NOW BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP
CONTRIBUTIONS EVENTS GRANTS PLEDGES
CASES REPORTS AND CAMPAIGNS I WON'T
ELABORATE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE IF YOU
WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EACH
OF THESE COMPONENTS BEANS IN THEIR
FUNCTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO TO SEE
PCRM ORG AND READ UP ON THE
DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THERE ABOUT THAT
SO I'M ONLY USING MAIL AND REPORT SO I'M
GONNA JUST GO AHEAD AND SAVE ALL RIGHT
AND SO REGISTER YOUR SITE SO CIVIC CRM
WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THEIR
MODULE OR SO SO YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE
MAILING LISTS AND THAT THEY NOTIFY YOU
OF WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING I'VE ALREADY
DONE IT SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT
JUST TO SHOW YOU IT TAKES YOU THROUGH
THEIR SITE AND IT'S A SERIES OF
QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU THERE
ALL RIGHT THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY
PREFERENCES AND SO WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING
A CONTACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FIELDS
THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WELL AS TABS
I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M
GOING TO UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING SO
LIKE CONTRIBUTIONS MEMBERSHIPS TAGS I'LL
LEAVE THAT CHECK EVENTS CASES GRANTS
PLEDGES I'M NOT USING I WILL LEAVE
MAILINGS CHECKED AS WELL AND SO THAT IS
WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT WHEN YOU
ARE EDITING A CONTACT YOU HAVE A NUMBER
OF FIELDS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED I'M
GONNA LEAVE THOSE SELECTED FOR NOW I MAY
CHANGE IT AT A LATER POINT WHEN GOING TO
DO A SEARCH FOR A CONTACT
YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF CRITERIA HERE
THAT YOU SEE I LIKE I SAID I'M NOT USING
ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M UNCHECK WHAT
I'M NOT USING THIS RELATES TO THE
CONTACT SEARCH AND THE CONTACT DASHBOARD
AGAIN I'M GOING TO UNCHECK SOME OF THIS
STUFF HERE BECAUSE I AM NOT USING IT ALL
RIGHT
CIVIC CRM ALSO DOES HAVE A WYSIWYG
EDITOR BUILT INTO IT THAT'S JUST
SELECTING SETTING THAT AND THE DISPLAY
NAME OF EACH PERSON IS ALREADY
CONFIGURED IN HERE BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT
TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I BELIEVE THE
THEME THE WAY IT IS YOU CAN SET IT TO A
DIFFERENT THING BUT LEAVE IT AS IS
ALRIGHT NEXT IS ADDRESS SETTINGS AND SO
IT HAS THE ADDRESS AUTOMATICALLY
DEFAULTED TO THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE
CHOSEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT OTHER
DETAILS IN HERE USING THESE TOKENS OR
TAKE THESE SOME OF THESE DETAILS OUT I
AM GOING TO UNCHECK LATITUDE BECAUSE I
HAVE NO NEED FOR LATITUDE AND I'LL LEAVE
I'LL UNCHECK COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE I'M
NOT REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRACKING
THE COUNTY IN HERE AND IF YOU WANT TO
USE A ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION PROVIDER
YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED
STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO
PUT IN YOUR CREDENTIALS THAT YOU WOULD
GET FROM THEM THIS LINK HERE WILL TAKE
YOU THERE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SETTING
THAT PART UP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO
THAT SO I'MA LEAVE IT BLANK
NEXT IS MAPPING IN GEOCODING SO IF
YOU'RE TRACKING ADDRESSES YOU CAN
ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THESE MAPPING
PROVIDERS HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THE SETUP
IT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A KEY AND YOU
CAN PUT THAT KEY IN HERE AND SO THE
BENEFIT OF THAT IS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY
USING THOSE ADDRESSES YOU CAN PULL UP
THAT CONTACTS INFORMATION HERE AND IT
WILL SHOW YOU ON A MAP WHERE THAT
ADDRESS THAT THAT CONTACT HAS IS LOCATED
IN THE WORLD
AGAIN I'M NOT USING THAT IT'S JUST I'M
ONLY DOING SENDING OUT EMAILS FROM HERE
NEXT IS THE SEARCH PREFERENCES SO PRETTY
MUCH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
REALLY IN HERE I NEED TO CHANGE SO ALL
OF THE DEFAULTS ARE FINE BUT BASICALLY
THIS ICON UP HERE IS SEARCHES AND YOU
CAN CHANGE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SEARCH
FOR JUST BY SELECTING IT ALL RIGHT SO
NICKNAMED A PAGE ORDER QUICK SEARCH
OPTIONS I'LL LEAVE THOSE AS IS AND TIM
RESULTS ALL RIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUST SAVE
IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING I ALWAYS MAKE IT A HABIT OF
WHEN I EXIT OUT TO SAVE JUST IN CASE I
DO CHANGE SOMETHING THEY FORGET ALL
RIGHT SO THE NEXT ONE IS THE
MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS SO CONTRACT
CONTACT TRASH AND UNDELETE I WANT TO
LEAVE THAT AT YES THAT WAY IF YOU
ACCIDENTALLY DELETE SOMETHING YOU HAVE
THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TRASH
AND RESTORE IT DON'T NEED TO DO ANY
LOGGING AND I DON'T WANT TO ATTACH PDFS
TO THE RECEIPTS THAT MAKE YOUR EMAILS
UNNECESSARILY BIGGER AND ALSO MORE LOAD
ON YOUR SERVER IF YOU'RE GENERATING
LETTERS LIKE IN BATCHES YOU CAN HAVE THE
OPTION TO CHANGE THAT HERE I'D RATHER
HAVE ONE PER CONTACT SO THAT'S FINE AND
THESE ARE OTHER SETTINGS RELATED TO
VARIOUS THINGS LIKE SENDING EMAILS AND
SO FORTH AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS
RECAPTCHA ON HERE IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU
CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THAT IT WILL BETTER
PROTECT THE FORMS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR
SITE OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE AN ERROR
HERE SO I BELIEVE MY MAX PHP AND MY
EXCUSE ME MAX UPLOAD SIZE AND MY
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS SET TO 2
MEGABYTES SO I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I
ORIGINALLY HAD 3 HERE WHICH WAS THE
DEFAULT
ALL RIGHT SO NEXT IS THE CONTACT TYPES
SO BY DEFAULT THERE ARE THREE CONTENT
TYPES BUILT-IN ORGANIZATION HOUSEHOLD
AND INDIVIDUAL DEPENDING ON YOUR USE
CASE YOU CAN TURN THESE OFF AND AND OR
AB OR OR DELETE THESE THAT ARE HERE FOR
RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO DELETE THOSE THAT
ARE HERE BUT I AM GOING TO EXCUSE ME
DISABLE THOSE NOT DELETE THOSE THAT ARE
HERE AND THAT WAY I'LL JUST STICK WITH
THE CORE CONTACT TYPES I MAY A LATER
DATE AND MORE TYPES HERE BUT FOR NOW
JUST HAVING INDIVIDUALS AND HERE IS
SUFFICIENT ALL RIGHT SO I'M DONE WITH
THAT LET ME GO BACK TO THE CONFIGURATION
PAGE ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE DONE CONTENT
TYPES
NEXT IS THE FROM EMAIL ADDRESS SO THIS
IS WHERE YOU WERE SET WHEN YOU'RE
SENDING OUT MAILING LISTS EMAILS THIS IS
WHERE YOU WOULD SET THAT INFORMATION I'M
ASSERTED TO NO REPLY YOU KNOW MOST
ENGINEER COMM ALL RIGHT AND IF YOU WANT
TO PUT A DESCRIPTION IN HERE YOU CAN
ORDER AND WHETHER IT'S THE DEFAULT
OPTION ALRIGHT SO THAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT
I'M GONNA GO BACK THIS TIME TO THAT
CHECKLIST BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT SAVE
ME TO THE WRONG PLACE OKAY ALL RIGHT
OUTBOUND EMAIL SO HERE IS WHERE YOU
WOULD SET WHETHER TO SEND EMAIL USING
SMTP SO IF YOU'RE WANTING TO USE A GMAIL
ADDRESS YOU CAN USE THE SMTP INFORMATION
YOU CAN USE THE SMTP OPTION AND THEN PUT
THE SMTP INFORMATION IN HERE TO BE ABLE
TO USE A GMAIL EVEN ADDRESS OR SOME
OTHER SERVER THE DEFAULT OPTION IS THE
MAIL BUT YOU COULD ALSO DO SMELL DISABLE
ABOUT EMAILS OR HAVE THEM WRITE TO
DIRECTLY TO THE DATABASE YOU MAY WANT TO
USE THESE LAST TWO OPTIONS IF YOU ARE
USING THIS IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT OR
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE EMAILS YOU
PROBABLY SEND IN PAPER LETTERS INSTEAD
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NATURE SO I'M
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO REDIRECT TO THE
DATABASE BECAUSE THIS IS MY DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT AND THEN I WANT TO SAVE ON
THAT ALL RIGHT
PAYMENT PROCESSORS SO IF YOU WANT TO
COLLECT PAYMENTS YOU CAN ENTER THAT
INFORMATION IN HERE IT HAS A DUMMY
PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOU PAID ATTENTION
TO THE LAST VIDEO THAT I DID YOU'LL SEE
WHERE I WENT IN AND SELECTED THE LOW
DUMMY DATA AND SO IT AUTOMATICALLY PUTS
A DUMMY PROCESSOR IN HERE HOWEVER I CAN
ADD INFORMATION IN HERE FOR PAYPAL SO
USING ANY PASSWORD AND SO FORTH AND MAKE
THAT ACTUALLY WORK LIKE IT SHOULD AND
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE WEB PAYMENTS PRO
STANDARD AND OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT
ALRIGHT SO THAT COVERS PAYMENTS GO BACK
TO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST AND THEN
NEXT YEAH THE TAGS OR CATEGORIES SO YOU
CAN SPECIFY THOSE MANAGE GROUPS SO LIKE
LIKE IT GIVES AN EXAMPLE STEERING
COMMITTEE AND IF YOU HAVE CUSTOM FORMS
OR SCREENS YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN PUT
THOSE IN AND THEN LASTLY THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED
WITH SEVILLA CRM YOU CAN GO THROUGH EACH
ONE OF THESE AND CONFIGURE THOSE I'M NOT
GONNA GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT AND THERE'S PLENTY
OF DOCUMENTATION ON THE SAVVY CRM
WEBSITE ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH
THESE ITEMS AND SPECIFY THE OPTIONS THAT
YOU NEED TO DO TO SET THEM UP SO THAT
