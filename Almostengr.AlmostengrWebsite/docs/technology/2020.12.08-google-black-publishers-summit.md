before leaving your website

* Affinity Categories: takes details of a users interests to better identify what your audience is interested 
in; use this to consider to expand content categories; in particular when topics can cross reference

### Reach your audience

* organic search =/= google ads
* prioritize what pages should be crawled on your website using robots.txt file 
* make sure that your pages add value to the user; do not publish existing or duplicate content

#### 1) focus on users 

* PageSpeed Insights
* Lighthouse

#### 2) let's communicate more 

* search console
* use the trainings and Search Console videos

#### 3) get your website searchable

* search for your domain only; if you have content appearing, then it is good and you have a ranking problem
* one way to stand out, structure your webpage data and include images if they apply
* for those that apply videos on website, there are structured that can be included. This allows to allow for 
parts of the video to be skipped to; this is done automatically on YouTube
* developers.google.com/search
* use cross promotions; promoting the content of others that are in similar industries

### Engage Your audience

* be staratetig about posting with a content calendar 
* start from the date you want the content to appear; then prepare 
* repackage existing content to create new content; do posts each week and then a summary at the end of the month
* create evergreen content (content that is always relevant to your visitors)
* Google Analytics can be used to determine when the content should be posted
* NCI (news consumer insights); it will provide actionable recommendations
* RES (reader engagement score) - used from the also 30 days; the score is dynamic; used to show you the 
most valuable traffic sources
* goo.gle/datatools


* try to increase content organically; do things like improve the user experience, work with other creators 
to cross promote; more users you have, the easier it is to improve traffic to website
* Analytics can used to identified sources of traffic; from there, the earnings can be connected
* difference between GA and NCI - GA provides info regarding the site, older tool;  need to have GA in order
to use NCI, NCI takes data from GA to provide a different set of insights
* most dont use Analytics 360
