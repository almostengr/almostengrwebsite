## Transcript (Unedited)

welcome back
i am continuing the process of the
update on the website
and i know you're probably thinking like
how many parts this is going to be
well it's going to be a is it it may end
up being a lot of parts
and the reason being because i want you
to be able to watch this in smaller
segments instead of trying to do the
entire project
in one large long video um
that way it's easier to you know stay
track and pick up on things
and so forth you know so you can take
breaks in between kind of like how i am
taking breaks
in between and recording each of these
video segments
where we last left off we did some
updating on the carousel
and put some images in so i've copied
some more images over to
this repository i've also made some
changes to the footer
and i figured it would be a little bit
better
to have this the same color we're going
to make some additional changes
to the footer though on video so that
you can see those how you transition
from this format
to a different format without further
ado
we'll go ahead and get into it
welcome back to the almost engineer
channel if this is your first time
checking out this
channel please be sure to subscribe by
clicking the subscribe
button below each week i come with new
videos and discuss
how to do technology on tuesday and how
to do diy projects on
saturday so if you're interested in
those topics
be sure to subscribe this week is a
special week because it is engineering
week and so as part of engineering week
i am actually doing my
national society of black engineers
website over during this week
and i'm doing it as a coding session so
that hopefully
you the viewer can learn something new
about
programming when it comes to website
design or just
how to code whether css html or
bootstrap even so picking up where we
left off i did make some changes to the
footer
in the previous video this was black
in the background and i've changed it to
the same color
as the nav bar because i saw some
designs that were set up that had
the nav bar and this bottom footer the
same color
so next what i'm gonna do is actually
change this from a
single color layout that goes all the
way across the screen to
a four column layout i'm not sure how
that's going to work with this banner
here but
we'll go ahead and convert it and then
figure out the banner part
at a later point
so i'm going to go ahead and go down to
the
bottom where my footer is
all right so here's the footer and in
visual studio code you can actually put
breakpoints here
i think there's another way you can
actually do a bookmark but i'm not sure
how to do
bookmarks in here so breakpoints help
out because ebbs you wear
keep track of your points in the various
places in the file
and what i'm going to do is actually can
change this container
to a
we're going to go with a row and i
believe that padding there and i believe
that
twitter class there but i'm gonna change
this to a row
and then on the next section i'm going
to do
all of that with a column of uh
for anything that is a large screen or
above it'll be a column of three
otherwise uh calls
i think it's sm will be 12
and yes so that's how i want that
i'm going to remove the horizontal line
and put that back
and then we're going to do the same
thing for the remainder of these divs
and we'll also need to
add an additional div and
remove the footer excuse me remove the
uh remove these additional containers
because
the parent container will address
everything else that i'm doing in here
and so uh so i need to put one
here and i need to add one more i
believe or do i have four on this page
let's see so i have one two
three four so i need to put this into a
footer and i'll probably leave this
copyright down here at the very bottom
but put these links off to the side in a
vertical lock if you will all right so
the last item this will actually need to
go
into a div because it does not currently
exist in one or yes it does well
the whole thing doesn't so right so
do a uh div here
and remove that so-called intelligence
from
intellisense trying to figure out what i
want to type
all right and we'll close the existing
div that's above
and so that should if i remove
these horizontal rows
and let's see all right so that should
be
it let me go ahead and do the formatting
on here to make sure my indentations are
correct
and it looks like i might be missing a
div somewhere
but let's go to the page and check it
out just to make sure
all right so everything is in a single
uh well that's not in there
all right um we got div container
and we want this
all right so we know this is the closing
container i need to move
this one and a corresponding div
and this one with the corresponding div
out of the way
if you do format let's see how that
lines up
it does not line up for well yeah it
does okay
let's move this down here i think that
might be correct
all right so we got uh the four cards
within
there and they are set up correctly
i know they're not centered like they
should
so let me do a
margin
of x auto hopefully that'll center there
we go
all right and this one is outside of the
car like i say we'll address that in a
little bit
and then the last thing is i want to put
these links up here i also need to
change the anchor text
for hover event to be
some other kind of color or just to stay
white whichever the case may be
so what i'm gonna do is go ahead and
copy the existing
copy the existing card here and i'm
gonna restructure
these links here and um
comment that one out do i need
card text card text card text art text
so actually i do need this one and i'm
gonna change this to links
and then card text i'm going to leave
that paragraph there i'm going to copy
these unordered lists
and put those inside of the paragraph
and well maybe not put them in a
paragraph let's see how they do
without being in the paragraph going to
go
current um
that out all right so what do we have
okay so we have some links over here
which look good like i say
this will be corrected and i actually
need to remove those down at the bottom
here
so we'll take this entire div comment it
out
uh let's uncomment this one first
and then i comment that
or comment that rather okay so now we
have what we're looking for
and this footer with the copyright in it
i guess that looks fine might need to
change the footer up here
uh class footer so it's probably
something in the css i think that's what
i said
um in the pre in an earlier video where
there was a margin yeah padding and
margin at the bottom
so we'll comment those two out for now
and so that should be
uh save it yeah so that should be closer
to the bottom
i think i need to run the minify
okay if not that's fine all right now
the
next thing is to
so i like this particular setup right
here i may want to take this border off
of the cars
or put some margin in between each of
these
and to do that let's go back to
base and
i want to do a m
x of 1 that's a margin on the x axis of
one
all right and so what i have to do is
actually so
when you do a column of three
and you have four of them then when you
try to put margin in
what happens is one of those columns get
kicked to the next
row which is not what i want so what i'm
gonna do is
actually change some of these to a
column of two
and remember all of your columns are
supposed to add up to
a total of twelve
so two two two
well actually we'll leave that one as a
four and then i'm gonna leave that one
as a three
and i know you're thinking 4 2 and 2 is
4 plus 4
is 8 plus 3 is 11 that is not 12. and
that is correct and the reason being is
because i want
them to be on the same line here but
also
want to have possibly a little bit of
margin
in between and that may be a problem so
i may end up having to take this margin
out
let's see what happens if i put padding
here instead
okay and padding may be the way
that i end up going i i'm kind of
hesitant
at this point so let's take that out
okay and
so i have a three
all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm
going to change this last column
so that column is three the amazon is
four
i need another one so we'll set this
donations one two three
and okay
so that looks fine not really
so three and three so three and three is
six
plus no yeah three and three is six plus
four is
ten plus 2 is
12. not sure if i want to leave it that
way
i may make the links a 2 and make the
join today
a 3 so let's give that a go
so links can become a two that way all
the links are in a single column
and then these others are in a wider
column
which is fine and then i'll probably
separate these links out
um
that's what i'm thinking maybe maybe not
if you have any questions about this
design drop a comment down below
um i would love to hear whether you
think these should be wider or narrower
that's a difficult word to say narrower
um but yeah especially with these
because these links actually have
multiple
are broken across multiple lines so
while i'm at it let me go ahead and
change the css
for these so the footer
[Music]
what is it something that turns red
the default text is a hover event
all right so we have the
footer line yeah so here we go so the
photo links
don't need to do that so on hover
i'm going to do a font weight of
bold on those and so when you mouse over
now they kind of jump up
and i think that's better that may work
for now i may change it again
later on but for right now i think this
does the job
cool all right now this banner here i
think i might just get rid of it all
together
and we just put something here that is
slightly different um
trying to find that code for that
better which is so that's the page
here we go we got the blocks
or did i wait a minute
where's the bookmark at there we go okay
so and see again this is where bookmarks
come handy
you can just look for the bookmark you
see it over here on the left
but it's not so much
as evident on the right as it is
on the left um in some i believe is
visual studio
it actually will make a when you have
break points on the left-hand side it
will actually show them on the scroll
bar as well
on the right-hand side so it's a little
bit easier to identify
but this here only has them showing on
the left so you kind of have to
scroll i do believe there's an option or
there may be an option
you um
i guess not sometimes there is an option
let's see jump to breakpoint
uh so you got enable audit point there
you go so go to the next break point
so that kind of helps uh if you're by
just stepping through the code and as
you see it jumps down there
um so that when you're doing debugging
you can utilize that all right coming
back to what we were working on
um so right now i'm going to
[Music]
so what i'm going to do is change this
right now because i don't like
that banner and at some point i have to
log
in and get the things for that banner to
be able to
officially do it a different way what
i'm going to do is
go what i am going to go ahead and do
now though
is to put a plain
text uh banner here
that represents that same
piece of information for amazon and
while this may not be the best way of
doing it it will work now
and maybe i'll take this javascript
that they have as well as this iframe
and give it a page by itself on the
website
that way the site will still blend in
together but then for the amazon small
it has its own page
and we can refer to that page directly
in our promotional items and so forth
to uh that way you know people don't
necessarily have to go to the site they
can
well they can go to the site still but
then they can use that as a
place to jump to a different page very
quickly without having to
go through multiple steps to get to it
because that was one of the complaints
that i had
uh received about how like you got to go
to
our site to get to that every time and
originally yeah that was the case
unfortunately that's how i was set up
but i
there's a different way that that can be
done now so amazon
smile
all right so there's that and if i go
back to our current
sites um
got it all right so uh shop and i'll
change this so
since we have this here i can actually
go back and change this to
all of these to threes and
or maybe even yeah so i think i can
change all of these to threes
and so they're equal now we'll get each
of these on a
line these links that is on a line
by itself may even put in the bullet
points as well
not sure why that careers link is not
showing up on the line by itself
that is kind of oh well
okay that makes sense because it's
listing each item as an inline item
which
it i don't want it to now
so go ahead and take those inline item
text out
save so now each link
is being displayed there and broken the
cm
css board which is
uh slightly inconvenient but that's fine
um
and i'll come back and do that one later
okay so
amazon smile is here i need to figure
out some text
to go on the amazon smile
thing so i'm just going to say if you
job with amazon um
please consider
using
for your purchase
and
all right that fills that text in i'll
go back and re-agree to
define it and clarify it at a later
point but that's enough to at least get
started for
right now and then uh
i guess i can go ahead and take that
page content so this right here
and um
well first let me uncomment it and then
go ahead and copy it out
and create a new page in the
not the theme so we want that in the
sites directory
and call it um
i want a separate page
all right so we can do that here so i'm
gonna just do it here
if i think it needs to go on a separate
page i might give his home page but for
now this will work
and
there we go all right so
and i think i want to put this amazon
smile thing up here first
granite we get more from directly from
direct donations over amazon smile but
i think a lot of people will be more
inclined because of the fact they're
using
uh they're using
this information to purchase
then go from there and actually i'm
probably going to reorder this because i
want this donations
text to be up here this is what we do
with the donations we provide them
use them into other programs so
scholarships
community awareness and outreach such as
our engineering day at the park
um yeah so
go ahead and save that and
[Applause]
save the page itself and so if i go to
the what is it donate yes go to the
donate
page the amazon smile thing is there got
to figure out how to get rid of that
white space but for right now it is fine
since i
am still testing things out i'm not too
alarmed about it but
long term this will move up or we even
have a different banner here
going back to the amazon smile thing
let's
go and in the base
need to add where is that link
um so amazon smile so
just copy what they have here and
and so this particular set of text was
provided from the template so i'm just
copy that
and do donate with a pound sign of
amazon
smile in here and that will
all right so with that this will take
you to the donate page as well as jump
down to this section of the page
so to demonstrate that let's go back to
the homepage
and scroll down past all this text and
hit shop today
and there we go we jump down to the
bottom where it says amazon smile
all right next let's go and fix the css
for the links over here on the right
hand side
so that will be in the
what i take out the left nav item list
item
i think that was this you know footer
yeah
so i took out this class but that should
address that problem
i think okay so it is bolding so i need
to do
also um the ul
footer i don't need the hover event i
need the
other pieces of the event here we go
all right so now my links are again
white
so that's what i want next i need to go
back and fix the links at the top
part of the page that have
this class this class needs to be
removed
is there a more efficient way of doing
this yes you can do find and replace
and in that find and replace you can do
[Music]
for it to search only the selection
and then do a find and replace based on
that selection um but i didn't do that
in
this particular scenario as you saw uh
it's not that many items and sometimes
crafting that uh find and replace
expression it takes a little bit longer
than just going through and doing each
line
that way all right so we have
our bottom section here of our top
section there
and there we go all right any point i
could
change this to black but i chose to go
with the red it seems to be a little bit
more of a subtle color
and i may even just change this back to
black though who knows
all right so we have all of that there
let me go ahead and change these to
buttons
i think it would give a better visual
appearance
if they were buttons so we just do a btn
on the not that that's the wrong button
a button as far as each of those
because it i think it will look better
that way but if it doesn't
um it can easily be undone if you think
it would look better with buttons
feel free to drop a comment to say
yes or no and in addition to the
buttons i need to also do a
class that corresponds to said buttons
because i want the buttons to stand out
and so if i have let's say
btn and then btn footer
there we go and then we'll do another
class btn
footer with a background color
that is black and text
color that is white
semicolon all right and
i need a border around this thing so
border with um gotta type it right
we'll go with uh 1px and
order color and we'll do black
save all right so we got that and then
there's another thing i thought it was
the background color but i guess it's
not
um let's see if i can
do this so btn
dark let's see what happens
uh oh okay so on mouse over it's working
not quite want it to look like this
without having to be moused over and so
let me see what other attributes it is
setting
bottom border which is fine left border
top color i don't know
what's doing so
how about this let's disable the css for
the moment
and see how it looks once it or if it'll
refresh
all right so button
start
okay so it does that right now if i
wanted it
so the background color is dark red
i think that's because the css
for that is telling it to be that way
overwriting it's not an inline style but
if i do an inline style
it would overwrite so i need
um btn
footer uh
yeah let's just stick with btn footer
re-enable that
and
yeah there we go i want the text to
still be white
so i have a hover event that is changing
that text to black not sure where is
that
on hover on hover on hover vtn
homepage
so we got a black with a body div dope
footer footer photo photo sub footer
um the background color is dark red
ah so here we go i think that does that
have cart link on it
yes it does all right so let's take this
out
and see what happens once it okay
so stop today has btn and btn
footer um
and the footer is defaulting to white
well that's just a general um
[Music]
all right so let's do inspect element on
this item
we got div card body let's see if
there's a card
body in here
spelling helps no okay so
the styles that is inheriting so you
gotta border
background color i want the background
color to be
uh if we can change that
one two three all right so a b t
n i'm trying to see where is btn
ah there we go all right so
black text is white
there we go now on hover or
a
um and i may have to narrow this down a
little bit
because that is not doing exactly how i
want
all right so btn footer so let's do a
dot btn dot footer
all right and change this abtn
back to dark red
and save okay and so now that is more
specific to what will show up here
and this and that's what i want
all right so coming back to the base
uh template going to change all the
class cards or class excuse me change
the class on all of the
links over to
btn btn footer and that's what we want
we want these buttons to
kind of or we want the links to appear
as buttons
and that they stand out and so when
click
they still go there which is cool all
right so
close the dev console and make sure all
the links
are working as it should be which they
are um maybe want to add a little bit
of flair to that
where here so let's do
a card title
so we can extend the card title i don't
think there's one already in here
title no good all right so we do card
title
and div dot card title
with a text uh decoration
of underline
and it did not do what i thought it was
going to do
all right so what other classes do we
need to add to make this
possible so i did a div
i don't think i need to do a div let's
come back so there's really a
h5 not a div that explains why that
didn't work
all right and so now we have that there
and
i really don't want that just on that
part
so i may go with a border bottom
of 1px or 3px
and then border style
of solid
all right and um
border bottom style
i'll play that century there we go and
so now we have
our length uh line that goes all the way
across the bottom here
and um i would say that's pretty decent
for the bottom um close dev console
i may want to let's get rid of this
border that is around the card
so coming back to the css
i want to do card and set the
order width to zero so i'm going to do
div dot card border
width width spelling okay
0px and save
all right and so now we have cards for
each of these
as you see there is no border here and
if you really can't see i'll zoom in
so now you see there's no border also
when we get to a certain size
that the divs go from side by side to
stacked on top of each other
which is the behavior that we want
all right and i'm probably going to put
another i put a horizontal rule down
here at the very bottom
to separate the bottom of the page
that copyright information out so come
back here and
the copyright information is down here
so we want a let's just do a hr i could
do a border in
in that div but hr should be sufficient
hr by the way stands for horizontal rule
and that needs a class with a
background color of white
all right and so there you see we have
that stretched all the way across
and so we are good to go on that aspect
of things
okay next step or next item
i have some pictures brought in and
they are sitting waiting to be leveraged
so what i want to do is to fill some of
these pages
such as the membership page that i was
on previously up
with some content and to also
work on some of the other pages i think
i had a scholarships
page yes and so i'm going to put
the picture that we have from previous
scholarship
years up so that
people i guess you could say no that is
real
and they can see some of the scholarship
recipients
and i'm not sure which photo is which um
i could actually pull up these images
in visual studio code if we do a refresh
on that directory and here we go all
right
so and i loaded several images in here
because i want to be able to do this so
this is one of the
community programs that we did we had
a number of people here myself back here
in the very back
and of course my traffic light all the
way up here in the front on display
um so i'm not sure which of these may
use let's see
when load the image that's convenient uh
that's myself with some other gentlemen
who are also in nsbe or where at least
when they were in college
all right so we'll go with this
particular photo here
and so this will be a community outreach
photo and if you go to
programs i want to put this photo
on the top of this page
so from the previous video we talked
about
uh having
alts yeah having things that uh images
on here and using that in the metadata
uh photo with participants
t-i-c-i-p-a-n-t-s
all right so we come back to the
programs page
so i should have okay so i have a bad
link here that's not what i wanted
oh images is plural save
all right and so what i'm gonna have to
do is to go to
my css and i'm gonna ultimately have to
resize this image
because as you see it is super large
um it was that's the original file so
i'm gonna have to resize this for the
web
but as a quick and dirty way of doing
this
uh what i'm going to do is to want to
create
a uh class
some create a class for image and we
call
uh head image all right and we'll save
that
and then we'll come back over to the css
file
and do dot uh head image
age parentheses and do a
width of um
let's say 100 i think that's what it's
supposed to be and height
of auto i think that's how you would get
that to resize yes
so what will happen is what it's doing
now because i put this css here
is that it's saying take 100 of the
width
of the page i mean excuse me 100 of the
parent container
and then the height being auto means
that this
image will resize itself to fit
that same space so for instance let's
say the width of the screen
is 500 pixels and so it will resize the
height
based upon that and so when you resize
it like this right here
to that nine through the smaller space
the image will automatically resize and
will not get cut off that's how you
avoid getting that right hand scroll bar
now ultimately i'm gonna resize this
again
so that it's not as high resolution
because if we do the image info this is
4 000 by 2 000 approximately
pixels which is a pretty large file for
the web and as you see is scaled down to
1080 by
608 all right so
um just keep that in mind but i wanted
this particular photo here because it
does relate to some of the community
outreach programs that we do
and the participation that we've had in
doing some of the things
that we do here um so
now that i've got that one there we'll
come back over here to
the abouts and that's kind of scaled
incorrectly too
and i maybe i may have to just do this
one individually
and when it comes to scaling uh these
particular set of images
and uh
maybe there's a different way of doing
that so
i auto maybe i'll just do height auto
and with auto
and let's see what happens then all
right so that resizes itself accordingly
this one is still too large there's a
way to do it so that it
fits um
so actually come think of it so let's do
a max width
of 100 that's what i'm thinking and
so that will fit there and then if we go
back to the about
there we go so that resized accordingly
to the way it should be
so that way you don't have these ultra
large images
stretching beyond the screen and so
again
max width will make sure that it doesn't
extend beyond
the container that it's in and this is
in particular two images
so what i really can do is actually do
image img
dot head image so that i know that
that's specific to images
all right um coming over to the
membership page
i do have another photo that i would
like to use
and the goal is to not use the same set
of photos over and over again
um and then the ones i do not need
i will take out uh
let's see okay that's a lot of the same
photo
all right so here's one that we do for
our
toy donation that we do all right so
this one is the one that i want to do
for the scholarship so because this is
the scholarship banquet that we had some
years ago
and let's go back to
let's go to the scholarship page and
then we'll put in
image url of slash images
with the file name and
i notice this is uppercase so let me fix
that right quick because
while some sys like if you're your
server if your website is hosted on a
windows space system
it will not make a big deal if that
file name is uppercase or lowercase but
on a linux based system
it will make all of the world of
difference if that is not done correctly
all right so the image alternate tab tag
rather is the scholarship recipients
um scholarship
recipient
spell check does not help that's the
thing
s-c-h-o-l-a-r
all right so that's there all right so
now if we come back to
[Music]
if we go to scholarship so we go to
programs
and scholarship boom we have an image
that is fairly again fairly large but it
can be resized
a little bit better i can actually set
the
max width so let me go to the css i'm
going to set the max width to 75
with the height of auto and so that's a
little bit more realistic
and where it should be i mean you can
even go down even further to as
fifty percent of the max width of the
screen
of that transparent container and to get
this a little bit smaller but i'm okay
with 75 percent
depending on some of the other images i
may need to adjust it accordingly and
this is
kind of similar as well as far as that
percentage goes
alright so that photo looks great and i
need one for the
membership i think i have enough uh
photos
six eight i use that there uh three six
one that's a different one
okay so maybe i need to go copy a few
more photos
because i think i might be missing some
from somewhere all right uh
yeah so go back to programs right quick
and we do have some engineering photos
i think i actually downloaded some hold
on i did download some here
i believe this is one i just need to
copy it over
okay so there we go
all right so this is another one i
actually just need to move them over
to the appropriate directory because i
forgot about those so
copy and open containing folder
because easier to go back
alright copy images paste
there we go all right so now that we
have those two images in here we can
come back over here and refresh and make
sure that they
work so use this path
um that's a very long file name that's
what happens when you
download images from that particular
social media site that starts with f i'm
not gonna call the name because they may
be listening
but we can rename that at a later time
uh let's see we have
membership programs
scholarship engineering day
ah okay so what i want to do
i need to go find a few more images but
what i want to do is also add some
images
to this carousel which is what i
previously mentioned in the
last video so we'll come back up to the
carousel
and i need to get this image off the
clipboard so i don't erase it
all right so i'm just going to copy a
carousel item well before i do that
let me go up here and i'm gonna add some
slides so i got
zero one two three and four
all right and yes that's good
all right so we got a div and we need to
go from
that div to i believe is
this one or the next the next one okay
i think that's correct save
all right and we'll run well probably
don't want to run the formatting on it
just yet
all right so copy that and i'm going to
remove that
paste and i'm going to check to make
sure it didn't break anything in process
okay so the image is there and i got a
couple of
i got one more or two more that probably
want to drop in
so that's that one that is a
i guess i can use this one on the
membership page granted all the people
in that particular photo
are not members but
majority of the people in that photo are
members so
image url and
do slash images slash that dot jpg
and image alt um
uh members
uh that's all right so there goes that
and so if you have that here boom so
cool for as the images go
[Music]
all right that needs to really be a h3
tag
so since i'm here change that to an h3
uh all right now back to the carousel i
think i had
a cup one more or two more photos
not that one this one yes all right so
we'll put
uh that down here and then there's
another
photo that's it
[Music]
yeah that's it so we'll go with this one
and
put that one down here as well and we
come back to the carousel
item and scroll down
to the div there copy
paste and paste and
we'll take this file here paste it there
and take this one here and paste it
there
and save and now i
think i have all of the carousel items
correct
all right so like a mist type
the jpg is it lowercase jpg and so this
is what i was talking about when you go
and do file names and the file names are
either lowercase or uppercase and they
don't quite match that you have that
problem
looks like the url is correct 12
54 17 jpg
saying that the file might be corrupt
which is weird
um because it just got through showing
it so i'm not sure how it's coming to
the conclusion that is corrupt
all right so that's what i copied
that one works that was worse okay
um so save again and see
images images got it all right so
scroll through scroll through woo
that is massively large and then that
one doesn't work
okay how convenient
all right so the width is auto and the
height is 100
uh percent of the parent
and looks like i'm missing the image
all right so we got how many
so let's collapse okay i don't want to
collapse that
one two three four
five six okay
so i got one too many images up here let
me take
this last one out and save so i got one
two three four
five and the number of images you have
needs to correspond to
the number of indicators on your
carousel
otherwise you're going to get a carousel
image that doesn't have
well it's going to scroll to the
carousel item that doesn't have a
corresponding image which will be a
problem
uh looks like i might be missing a
something on a div somewhere not fully
sure
all right so let's take one of these out
see
i think that's correct all right so if i
do that
and three four
and it should glitch which it's doing
that's fine with me
all right so this image i probably don't
maybe i don't need to use that
particular image
um all right so let's put that there
well that's the same fault how
convenient
5459 okay so let's try this one instead
all right and with that there
that should work carousel next and first
okay okay there we go
all right so one two three four five
i think this because this image is so
large it's
not really sure how to handle it which i
don't quite agree with why it's not sure
with how to handle it
um so let's do this let's
take well that styling probably doesn't
need to be in line
i think i need to put a class there
instead
so let me do a style
on this last one so let's do a style
uh but that's not going like that
can i do that nope doesn't like it got
it
all right so we'll just cut it put it on
the line by itself comment
and then do a class of head
image it's what i use technically i'm
not
trying to use this on this line but
trying to see if it will actually make a
difference and make this fit or not
and it doesn't look like it will make it
fit
um which is fairly weird that it
wouldn't
want to fit there so let's uh
we'll go ahead and do style equal width
of 100 percent
and heights is auto for this
and see what happens with that
particular image
okay so it's a little bit better uh
than what it was before still not
scaling the way that i would like it to
75 on that one and see what happens
a little bit i'm not sure why still
trying to scale
because it's supposed to scale to let's
take this one out
it's supposed to scale to the parent
container which is still not there
okay and i might just have to just
ultimately resize this image all
together
to 50. all right go back
okay so now i have the whole image but
i'm not sure why it's not
trying to fit to this container here um
usually that doesn't happen or at least
in my experience it doesn't happen
but uh
yeah there's that at least it is
scrolling all of the other images
and they're fitting for the most part
let's view this image
so okay so the bottom part of this one
is also being cut off i didn't realize
that
um so if we go back so you see here
the desk and the floor are not seen in
this part
and i may need to make some alignment
adjustments to
this particular photo so i'm actually
probably going to do
a text was it text line
center on that one and see if it moves
it
up or not okay so it didn't move it up
a little bit tricky to deal with but
uh yeah we'll go with that for now
and so actually i did the wrong image or
did i
okay so we're going to change i think i
did do the wrong image
and yeah so let's trace this to
about 60 of the width
and height auto and if we come back
so 60 percent is still within reason for
that so all of the images
are now looking fairly good in my
opinion
okay that being said i'm going to do
some cleanup here
so don't need these h1s anymore
worst case scenario go back and copy
them out of their respective
templates so i'm going to leave
that div there in case some text does
need to be put in in the future
but as you see right now i really don't
need that
all right so there's that there's that
whoops
three and
all right and i know i mentioned in a
previous video
that sometimes i leave code in like
commented out until the very end
as i just absolutely certain that i'm
not going to use it but this
i know i'm not going to use so i'm just
going to go ahead and
remove all of this out
so again at any point that you're
watching this video
you know or even after you get done
watching this video feel free to drop
any comments that you may have or any
questions about how i am doing things in
here
and so once you remove all your comedy
code make sure you haven't broken
anything in a process
because yes while the code is commented
out sometimes you actually can break
stuff in the process
and that's not a good thing so
all right so we have our images up here
at the top and we have membership has a
photo
programs as a photo the events pops to
another site
photos i probably get another image
there and then
we have this uh city image here
and we're going to get officers listed
as well as
their positions i'm going to do that
later i may or may not do that
particular part on camera
so continuing on the
next item i want to work on is the home
page
so what i did was look at some of the
other chapters websites
and they do have the
these header items here that i commented
out so i'm just going to go ahead and
restore
this particular set of items and go
ahead and fill it in
so let me go ahead and format this
section here or format the document
um it may have formatted the entire
section though
and i think i don't have a corresponding
item
all right so and i have a container at
the top
i believe no i don't so um
[Music]
so this does not need to be in the co
well yes it does
okay so i only want these
heading i guess they call them
featurettes or something of that nature
you only want those on the home page so
i'm going to extend my if condition
for my carousel the image thing that
at the top of the home page so this
thing here is called the carousel so i'm
going to extend
that or loop include this part of the
uh header thing to only show when this
down here is not showing as well and
[Music]
then
yeah we'll leave it at that and so for
the
page body of the index home page i
don't need any content so what i'm going
to do is to
say adios to everything in here delete
save and so all of this text down here
the bottom should disappear
which it has and then all i have now is
the
headings that are hardcoded into the
page which is what i want
all right so let's do another formatting
of the document to make sure everything
is in alignment and it looks
like it may or may not be i think i
actually
don't have i need a closing div for that
container slash div
all right and so now i have to do a
format
i think that's correct now yes
and all right so i want to highlight
certain aspects of the website in this
heading section and to do that
i'm just going to pick out various
things so one of our
signature programs is engineering in the
park
we call it e day at the
park all right so i typed that in
and looking at it making sure that it
actually fits in this space
looks good the other thing i want to do
is ask people to join so that will be
the left block
and then on the right hand side i think
i'm going to go with
programs all right and
there we go so we have drawing
either at the park and programs should
be plural
not singular looks like we might have
caught it there we go
all right and so next we'll have
the links so this will go to the
programs page
plural this will go to the eday page
and this will go to the membership
page and we'll need to put the leading
slash on there
all right and so if we test these out
they go to the membership page which is
correct
go to the e-day page which is correct
and goes to the program page which is
also
correct and then i got to figure out
some text to drop in
i may just do like some preview text so
we already have some text here
i may just take this copy it
and for this particular paragraph drop
that in
paste and obviously it doesn't like
that long line format and let it wrap on
its own
and there you have it for
yes so whoops no not down here here we
go
right here all right and so i'm gonna
put a
end container tag of
uh and
headings and that way as i scroll
through this template because this
template is fairly long
um it's 450 lines exact
and that is because of some of the
comments are still in here and so forth
but i still want to be able to scroll
through and be able to find
like the beginning and ending of the
divs and not have to
be like tracing like i've kind of been
doing as you've seen me do
so this is a little bit easier way just
to put a comment there at the end
of it and the same thing with like your
closing conditions so like for instance
at the top of this file here
i have several uh conditions here
so like this one so for instance this
meta tag so at the end of this one i
could actually do this
in title condition or something like
that nature
and that helps you be able to find uh
that in the file so when you're
scrolling through
you know if you have five or ten
conditions in there that you're looking
for
it helps you find that ending fairly
quickly so you know where to start from
and where to scroll back
up to all right so i did that for that
one
let's copy the text for engineering date
at the park
and i'm gonna just put this here at some
point i probably will go back and refine
this set of text not while on camera
though
uh because you know sometimes you can
spend a lot of time trying to figure out
what to put here and
it's still not come out right all right
so
and i like when i have paragraphs i like
the text in the paragraph to be on its
own line
that way when i start if i were to add
like classes those classes could take up
this entire line
you know depending on how many you put
in here i know some people they rather
have their paragraph
as concise as possible but i am not
necessarily that way
readability of the code is more
important to me
than being concise but there are
different schools of thought on that
so think about it as you may
all right so for this last thing uh
we'll go ahead and copy and paste and
i'm actually have to change the text i
don't know if you actually read it
before i saw
complete all of these steps listed
on the membership page
all right and so if you come back here
to the home page now
all right so we have joined asby we have
programs
and i'm gonna like i say redef refine
these paragraphs here um and also try to
make a little bit more even
than what they currently are and
there's that okay
and so uh yeah
this is coming out pretty well i did not
need to
click that page
all right so so far so good like i say
depending on
the feedback i get from the other
members in the chapter this
color scheme may change as it stands
right now i'm sticking with
this dark red but it may change to black
um
at you know a later point so if you're
checking this
at some point in the future after this
video has already been released
just know that it may change from the
way it looks now
and so when you look at it don't be like
hey he's got red in the video but black
in actuality
or green in actuality and that is
probably going to be the reason why so
just keep that in mind
all right so that will wrap things
up for this video series
um as you see i've taken if you have not
seen the other videos in the series
a link will be in the description below
uh
starting from the beginning to the end
this
you know has been a very week uh
education for me because
uh in some of the other videos i
actually learned how to do things myself
for
some of the css items that i was not
familiar with so
it's kind of surprising but you know as
i'm teaching others
the good thing about it is when you
teach others you also learn something
yourself
um so you're able to even further that
advancement of the knowledge that you
have
to other people so any questions
drop those down in the comments section
below if you have learned anything from
this video series i ask that you please
give this video
and the other videos in the series a
thumbs up
if you have any questions comments if
you don't want to put your question in a
comment
shoot me a message on instagram or
twitter
at almost engr the handle is up in the
upper right of your screen
i do respond to messages that i receive
i do reply back to the comments that are
posted
so it may take some time for me to do it
but i do see it and i do respond
alright until next time peace out
and hopefully you have a good engineers
week
