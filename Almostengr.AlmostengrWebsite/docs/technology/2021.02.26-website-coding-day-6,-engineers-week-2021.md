## Transcript (Unedited)

 i
have the contact form created
and the only way to access it is to
click down here at the bottom i also
have some links within the pages
themselves
that will have a link to the contact
page
so i want to show you how i'm about to
do this form
now i could put the email form in
the markdown file but i don't want to do
that because i
tried my best to avoid having html in
the markdown file
i've done this here but when it comes to
an entire form that is a lot of content
to have in there so what i'm going to do
is actually
kind of copy some existing code that i
already have
and so on my website what i did was
normally you cannot submit
with a static website submit data
so uh and that's kind of a bigger
problem
because there you have to have some kind
of server side
processor that will have the ability to
be able to
handle the data that is being passed
to it so what i have done was on
my website i created a php file
and this is it so i'm just going to go
ahead and copy it as
is and put it in over here
so again i talked about in an earlier
video
about reusing code that you've already
written nothing is wrong with that
some people frown upon it but i enjoy it
because
hey it saves me time like literally i am
not having to write this over again
and uh
visual studio code is trying to be
intelligent right there with all of that
but
i have no um
no need to try to fill all of that out
all right so what i've done is i've
actually
copied this code and what it does is
you're basically checking to see if a
value is set and if it is set you're
going to take all the content
that is in that form and
so here we go so it's a post array and
you will literally
split that array out into the message
body of
the email and then you will
add the date time to that email as well
as
uh the service type which i'm gonna have
to change
to customize to this form with the
current time
and then the headers which is the from
address
and then i have a helpdesk email which
is a variable that is being sourced from
the environment variables which i will
show you how to do that here shortly
i do not put my environment variables in
the
version controls it's just a file that
sits on the server in production
and then a different file that sits in
development so it's kind of like a
i treat it like a configuration file and
that way it's not ever committed to the
code base that way i'm not sending
emails when i'm trying to test my code
i'm not sending those emails from my
development environment to
actual email addresses that would be bad
um so by making this environment file
uh that works there so basically you got
the helpdesk email which i have an email
dedicated to
a dedicated email address in production
for my particular website
on this one it will be a email that is
dedicated to the organization kind of a
generic email
and then that email has forwarding built
into it so that
you send it to one address and then that
one address forwards it to
i think it's like four or five different
of the executive
uh officers of the chapter so uh
pretty much want to level that setup and
if the mail was successful then redirect
to
what is a submission page if not then
you
do a unexpected error and
fail out and then if somebody tries to
come to
this page directly then it redirects
back to the home page by default
that being said all right so i have my
submit.php
and so what i'm going to do is to add a
condition in here
that will check to see if
we are on the con contact not contract
contact page so if page.url
is equal to contact i believe that's how
that's set up
with the there and then i also want to
do a else
and then so if we're not on the contact
page show the page content
if we are on the contact page show this
particular form that i am about to
code out format all right there we go
so that being said you want to have
you want to have some information in
here
let's see you want to have the form in
here so that
uh it shows only on that page okay so do
form
and we're going to have the method of
post
and the action will post to
the submit php page that we just created
and close that form out cool now i
recommend having
recaptcha on your forms i'm not going to
cover how to do that or i may come at a
later point and cover how to do that but
uh recapture basically you go into
google then you
do a search for google recaptcha and
they give you a key and token and so
forth and then you copy the text the
copy what they give you
to paste it on your page and that
verifies
it somehow magically hooks i think with
the use of shell script i mean cell
scripts
javascript it will hook into your form
and so basically if the recaptcha
is not completed then your form is not
allowed to be submitted
so that's a you know helpful way to
prevent
from getting spam all right so pretty
much i'm going to replicate
what is already here on the current form
that we use on the website
and so go ahead and start out
trying to see let me look at the source
for this particular page
um curious on how this was set up now
mind you this is a drupal form
and so uh the drupal way of doing things
may not be the
most efficient way of doing things but
it is here nonetheless okay so they have
a
form id with the method of posts and the
form post back to itself
and then it looks like each element or
each field on the form is contained
within a div
and they have a label as well as a
input for each of those items so that is
very doable here
so we'll do a label
and we'll do a label for and the uh
we'll call it uh requester name
i try not to use keywords in
my labeling or uh attributes if you will
of the page so that's where that comes
from all right and so we'll call it name
and the next one we'll do an input
of type text
and once you have it
with a placeholder it says
enter your name there we go and this
field
is going to be required and
i know some people they just like to do
the single attribute so
they'll type required like that
personally
i hate this because when you look at it
if you're just scanning and looking at
the attributes it looks like this
particular attribute
does not have a value associated so what
i
usually do is required equals required
and i know that's like well but that's
that is valid html um believe it or not
so when there is a
attribute that has that really doesn't
have a value
usually the attribute is also the same
thing as that value so required equals
required and um
i think there's a yeah mainly so instead
of just
people just typing two or three letters
for
the sake of this you should want to try
to get them to type their full first and
last name in here
so i'm gonna set the min link to four
and so that way if they try to type it
in and it doesn't
uh it should not pass
for that reason all right so i also want
to include the form control on
this particular form and the reason
being is because the form control
provides some css styling that
is built into bootstrap and so i want to
be able to leverage that
i also need to set a name
in here and i probably need to wrap this
on the well
probably wrap itself so set the name to
request their name
on this and i mean you could just set
this name
set the label for equal to name and then
name equals name but that
in my opinion looks rather weird so i
tried to avoid
those type of setups i know some people
they don't mind it nor do they care
they're more concerned with if it works
it works and
i shouldn't be concerned with what it
actually says but you really should be
concerned with what it actually says
all right so the next one is the email
field we're going to change this to
email
address likewise email
address
and i don't know what i just did there
email address the type is email and yes
that is a valid type
enter your email address that field is
required
and a main length let's see is really
a one two
so even if you had a at b
dot c a
at b dot c so it's at least five
characters so we're gonna set that to
five that way the forum won't just be
submitted
um it'll probably be a pain for some
people that are just trying to get
through this form really quickly
but we're really trying to reduce the
amount of spam submissions that are
being submitted
so uh that's how you do that you set
them in link
all right so phone call
is what i'm gonna call this instead of
phone number um because some spam box
can figure out these things
so or uh
actually we'll have a little bit of fun
here so i'm gonna name this field call
tyrone and the label is actually going
to be phone number
and we're going to call tyrone oh
type equals phone i think there's a type
uh is there a type of telephone so let's
see
uh input field types
phone number
all right so for phone number you have a
telephone type and hey
well why not just go ahead and copy this
piece of snippet here i didn't
there we go all right so paste use that
pattern
and that pattern is a regular expression
um depending on where you're at that may
or may not work
uh so just a placeholder
and do it
five five five five five five
five five all right um
we'll set this to required
uh and then length
is uh
let's see that is ten digit phone number
with two extra characters so a min
length of 12
and close that out in that div
so div class form control
and we have another which i'll go ahead
and copy
copy paste say
form control and if you come back to
here we have
subjects i don't really think we i mean
short summary may be helpful but i think
i'm gonna go ahead and inject my own
summary here
uh when the form processor so i'm
actually going to do this last one
as message comment or
question not request
and we'll do this as message
and actually probably want to do this as
a i believe that is a text
area not a input yes it is all right so
we're going to
cancel that i mean not cancel comment
that for the moment
so text area and name is message
and let's see what we have so we have 5
rows in 60 columns
and the placeholder is messaged with the
name and required
okay all right so we'll do uh required
is
equal to required no not requester
required there we go all right name
rows is five
columns we'll stick with uh
well we're not gonna specify the columns
we'll see how that plays out
without that piece of information being
present
and let's see placeholder
uh enter your message
text all right so if we come back and
refresh the page
we do not have the page body and it's
probably because of
this url all right so there we go
all right so we have our page body it
looks weird because well it is weird
nonetheless
all right need to see where
things may be going a little funky with
this
um so we have a div that's inside of a
container
we have a form and a form has a form
control
uh maybe that
form control is the problem because hey
my message message message okay that's
there
um all right so let's take
these divs out matter of fact let me
start at the top and work my way back
down
to see if that will make a difference in
the presentation of it
okay so that works um
and i was going off of what existed
previously but
you probably should not have dev
okay all right so that being said now i
need to
i'm going to use paragraph tags instead
that way i don't have to do line breaks
after each one and
it should automatically break yes there
we go all right so
uh that's a closing okay
there we go that there that there
that there and that there
all right safe all right and so now to
get
our labels above
um do line breaks on each one you could
put your label on the line by itself to
be honest
and so instead of this do that
and then do that whoops there we go safe
now how does that look so that looks
pretty well and if i put
the class uh form
control on here it should do some
styling here
yeah so it stretches it out the entire
width of the screen which is what i
want all right so to do the same
for the other elements some have to
oops copy yeah there we go and
go ahead and move this up paste and
while we add it remove that other code
that is no longer needed
so that
there right save so now um
the next part is to actually i didn't do
that for the labels like i should have
so we'll come back here and drop that in
behind each of the labels
and then we'll save and then come back
and put the
label excuse me the class
of form control on each of the labels
copy
paste put that in there
paste do a format right quick because
that's a little
iffy looking all right and now we have
our
labels accordingly
so if we come back again to our labels
i want to make sure that people know
that they are required
so there's a label attribute called
required
um or is it is required maybe this is
required
okay that's not there i may have to come
in and define that
we also want to do font weight bold
on this all right so that is bolded
and that's what we want and
so come over to the css
uh that's bmp css there we go all right
and i'm gonna go down here at the bottom
and do a dot required
and i want to is it after
something uh let me see how i did it in
here because there is a way that you can
have
your page excuse me there's a way that
you can have the css
to add characters to the beginning
or the ending of an element and i'm not
sure if i
i know i've done it on other sites i'm
not sure if i've done it on this one yep
here we go
so label required and literally i can
just copy this
and paste that in required after and
label that required
and i want to use the um
we'll go with the nesby red on this one
since this is a brighter
red color so if you come back to the
page
uh not required the required is a class
and that class is on that label it
should accept
oh it doesn't accept that because i need
to
minify the file and there we go
all right and so my metaphy file is
being referenced in my html here
so that's why that did not work all
right
the next thing um
these attributes look a little bit
small compared to
what they probably should be on the page
and also kind of look a little bit
spaced out in my opinion so let me do
this
with the line break instead and that's a
little bit closer and then i think i'm
gonna make this a little bit bigger
so we can just take out each of these
paragraphs
and replace them with line breaks
and sometimes you'll have to do i know
you're thinking well you just typed that
code in now you're taking it back out
yes because sometimes when you're
designing things you run
you know you type it initially and then
when you actually look at it once you've
implemented
your light that doesn't look right it
needs to be fixed and so
that's essentially what has happened in
this case for me
is i didn't like the way it looked so i
went back and redid it
being very proficient with the keyboard
and the shortcut
short keys or excuse me the short being
proficient
with these keyboard and the shortcuts
on the keyboard for the application that
you are using helps
i use visual studio code for my personal
development
but i also use
uh visual studio in my day-to-day work
and so
sometimes that has a tendency because
i'll type the wrong
shortcut in and get either no
action or get an unexpected action and
that's always
interesting to have to deal with after
the fact
all right the last thing i need is a
input button
of type submit with
name submit
and value of submit
that is proper cased
and saved and then also need to add the
class
of vtn and
the btn
um there's another btn i'm not sure what
it is
hold on all right so i got to input
let's go to the css
and look for the dtn classes so we got a
btn got a btn
footer you got a regular btn
for the links all right so
whoops and that's associated with that
all right so
coming back so let's do btn.dark
for the moment and see what that looks
like so that looks fine
um i don't know if it's black or not let
me see
inspect element and pcn dark
is dot black all right so
what i think i'm going to do is to go
ahead and
overwrite so btn do a class
btn-dark and
um we'll do a
background come on
color that is black and save and so
re uh modify the file
that will update the css for it and if
we refresh the page
and do an inspect element this should
have
all zeros which it does so that is good
to go
all right so we'll close out the dev
console
and come back over here and copy the
text off of the
uh wait a minute
oh i do have text on this page okay so
let me
do come back to the page because i
realize
now my if condition is incorrect so i
don't need this
else here but i do need that page
content because the page content
and actually in this particular scenario
the page content comes above this if
condition
because i want the form to be at the
bottom of the page not at the
top all right now we have everything on
the compact page correct
so we have our introductory set of
information along with social media
and email at the bottom and just a basic
form
message comment question now the submit
handler is set up it
should not do anything well yeah okay
should verify that
this field is not blank all right so
you type that in there it's still
blowing red for the
uh
the phone number which is should because
it's not in the expected format
all right so if we do submit so at least
12 characters you are using eight so
let's see
all right okay so we're still
complaining that
format does not match which is great and
this one is already being validated
because if we come here
should be being validated as an email
address if not
i need to um i'm not sure if i have a
email form so i can come back to
my partial i have a contact i don't
think i have a contact
i do have a request service
page that has a form on that
emailer placeholder you got emailer
men link is equal to five on the form
that i use
and the placeholder text is there
um i don't think i put it placeholder
text in here
so user add i'm gonna do an sbmp.org
to place that and
we'll do
all right so formats of each of those
and we'll change this here to i have a
question
about svmp and
so if i come back to the site and so
placeholder text is filled in behind
here
and if you actually go ahead and click
contact again that will clear out the
entire form
the placeholder text is there if you try
to submit it by default obviously it's
not going to do anything
but that is how that works and then our
submit
function which will be called by this
particular url
we'll send it over to our submit page
and then we need to have a page that the
submit page
or the submit script rather redirects to
so we're going to call that submission
and so
name that submission.md
and looking at my existing code i think
the only thing i have in submission
is that that page is not indexed
and so if we go back over to the docs
folder and
mine i actually think i have it submit
slash index
no that's not it okay so here we go
submission
and so my submission has a redirect
built into it
and that is it so let's look at the raw
text and literally just copy that and
paste that in here
title submission successful and it needs
to redirect
back to the root page i
also need a
[Music]
as you see in the submission page i do
not want google to
index this nor do i want it to follow
the links on this page
um it could follow the link because this
link actually just goes back to the home
page
but i don't want it to follow the link
and i don't want it to index it so i've
added this robot's
uh attribute in here and in my base
template file i have in the metadata as
soon as we can get back up to the top of
the screen here
i have a robots attribute here that
says that if the robot's file if the
robot's
keyword is in the metadata of that
particular page then you follow what's
in there otherwise you can do it index
and follow for
whatever it is so uh no concerns would
this be an index
and should not be to further make sure
that that doesn't happen
we can come actually come down here to
the robot.txt and
come think of it i actually need to move
this so we're going to cut that from
right there and put that
into the docs folder um
there we go so we have a robot txt and
you can have a
disallow attribute here and
do a slash submission be
that and then um
there's also slash submission
slash index.html all right and so
that way it ensures that no crawler
will run across this file and put
the submission page as a page on a
google search result or
go or bing or whatever you use
for your primary search engine and then
the submission page
um this submission script rather
it should email out and if you want this
you can just copy it out of the
repository the link is down in the
description below
where you can view this repository you
will need to define some variables here
i have helped this email in here and i
think i'm still going to leave it at
that
and then that will be sourced in a
configuration file this path may need to
change depending on what it has
or where it's located on the server in
production i haven't logged into the
production server
in some time so i will need to figure
out where i can stick this
outside of the web route so that this
can be called as neby
so that is essentially how i do forms
within
a mk docs website
so if i come back to the contact us page
so as you see we have a full form here
and ready to go i know some people they
put the submit button as the
uh well submit and then there's usually
a link that goes to cancel or something
of that nature
i usually don't do that usually i figure
if somebody's going to go to a page and
they don't really want to submit it
they'll find and go to wherever else
they need to go so they may click
the contact page again and that will
clear that out for them or they'll go up
here and hit refresh and which will also
clear that out for them too
all right that being said move on to the
next item and i think i have all of my
pages covered
so my social medias are working and they
are referenced on the contact page
phone number is working for the chapter
we have our links that point to various
aspects of things on nsbe
and what i want to do that i'm just now
noticing is like i don't have the https
on all of the urls that reference
some of the other sites so i want to go
ahead and put the https in there
does it make a difference maybe maybe
not but
if the https does not work that's not my
fault
that means the url on the other end is
not using https
and while it may penalize my site i'd
rather redirect users to another https
site instead of just the http due to
uh demand in the middle of the tax that
exists
as well as the google
you know factoring in https for its own
site and for its own purposes
so here we have all of these things
corrected
let's do format on this uh
uh actually do a trim on this thing
and then do format all right and so
i notice it's weird i was doing some of
these paragraph tags on one line and
some of them not on the other so let's
do format again
all right so i like to see consistency
in
my work and because i like to make sure
that it is readable
a little bit of ocd if you ask
uh me in some regards but i do believe
that
neatness is helpful and a little bit of
spacing
is useful like as you see i use one
space between
blocks of code i know some people
they'll use four or
three or two after that but i just go
with one
because obviously everything else is
bumped up next to each other so i know
that's one
grouping same thing here with this
particular card i know this entire card
is grouped together
because i have a separator of white
space or blank line if you will
in between the two
all right so contact form is done with
the page content showing
and just to verify that i haven't broken
anything else
again go through your site checking
looking at the various pages
make sure everything is still the same
images are not
you know sideways or anything of that
nature buttons are still
appropriately displayed and
links are still working and that's not
the link that i wanted to click
all right program so we come over here
look at some of the stuff here
at the scholarship and so forth and so
um
yeah so there's that i may do another
role of
these blocks here that also highlight
the
scholarship program that we have
some other information maybe about the
chapter
and maybe another block for membership
um so matter of fact i guess we can just
go ahead and work on that now
and as soon as i can locate the text
alright so here we have
a container and a row so what i'm going
to do is actually just go ahead and copy
this entire row from get her here
copy enter paste there we go all right
and so for this one want to we'll do
join nsbe on this one
and i know in the other video you
probably like from the other video you
probably
may have remembered if you have watched
it it's like did we already do this
yes and i went back and changed them
because i thought that
it would be more appropriate to
highlight the involvement of the
kids and there as well as some of the
other things um
first instead of what i originally had
which i think the first name was join
so we'll put this scholarship
and what's the other thing i can
highlight
uh so i have joined scholarship
and let's see
programs professional development
we got our nesbi jr already highlighted
about
and
i guess we could do meetings as the
other thing because we do have meetings
every
month so we'll do meetings here
and i'm actually going to take this and
put the meetings up here
before programs and
cut that programs off there
and put it down here at the bottom
and save and so yeah
all right and so meetings so and i'm
[Music]
actually
okay for the meetings i really can
display all of the information here for
meetings
and it pretty much is that
uh tuesdays first of each month
all right so if we come over here to
got that we got the first three
and then we got the um so
i'm gonna do like i mentioned earlier
uh have a closing tag so end of first
row
and then come down here to the bottom
well end of headings is fine
so scholarship programs meetings so in
the meetings block
we'll put that there save come back
to the home page and so we have meetings
um clean up this text meetings
are held the first tuesday each month at
6 00 p.m central time
there we go all right uh
and so now i'll come back at some point
later and update this
join i can go ahead and do the links
right now at least
so the join will go to the membership
page
the scholarship will go to the
scholarship page
and the programs will go to the programs
page which is good
and then the meetings will also go to
the programs page
as well and so if we do meetings and
scroll down
and i actually want to do a uh
so we do programs with uh
i guess the jump to professional
development
we'll save that and so if we go here and
then back to meetings it should jump
down to professional development which
it does
so that's good
all right and um
a membership that goes to membership
all right cool and
the scholarship goes there
and so a couple of things i want to get
is a
sign up mailing list sign up page uh
we'll actually get have to get the
information or a piece of the
information from
mailchimp because they provide a like i
think a
form builder in their site that you can
use
and that form builder will spit out
whatever it spits out
and then all you have to do is copy and
paste that into
the page itself and it should be good to
go
all right so if i have some additional
uh i guess
call out actions here i can add that
here but um it looks a little bit better
now that i have more items here
because originally i was just thinking
that there was a few items
um here and it was not very much white
space to be honest and i wanted
a little bit more white space taken up
or more things that's taken up
in the white section of the page
so it's good to have a little bit more
content here on the home page
for that um so if you come back over
here
uh so your jump down links work as well
there like you should
if you come over here so this is one of
the contact pages links that i was
talking about
so you click that here and it goes to
the contact page
and all the contact information is here
melon dress phone and so forth
all right so scrolling through
everything else still
looks like it works like it should this
image here i'm not sure
why this image is still acting the way
it's acting but it is
active when the way it's acting and so
um not really much i can do about that
at this time but
hopefully i'll get that addressed so
these buttons are turning gray
when i mouse over not sure if i'm okay
with that
let's go back over and look at so we
have the secondary
button class here on
those um
is that right yeah i got the center
secondary
button class on here i'm not sure if i
want to keep that secondary button class
or not
i guess it wouldn't hurt that that's
there um
the worst case scenario again and
probably just have to take it back off
and change it to something else maybe
change it to
black so instead of secondary we'll
change this to
btn dark and if we come back up here
which one did i change so the join
all right so that turns black and it
kind of coordinates with the
buttons down here at the bottom so i
guess i'll go ahead and do that with the
rest
so btn dart btn dark dark
dark dark dark and dark there we go
all right so when you mouse over now
they all turn
black well i forgot one oops
which is fairly easy to do sometimes all
right so now that one turns black
all right so we are good on each of
those
and then it's good to see that each of
these headings are lined up across even
though the
items above are not necessarily the same
height
that these second row of things are
aligned because of the fact they are
in a row um so going to resize this
just to show you the resizing of
the items so let's say you're on a phone
and you're looking at this
this is what it would look like so you
have this navigation here
and that's not centered but um
and that's really not centered so that's
something we have to address as well
actually none of these photos are
centered so uh
i had to see how i can address that so
that at least the center of the photo is
there and it is being resized
accordingly because that is not
resizing like how i would like it to or
it to be the carousel
but these the individual heading or
subsections down here on the home page
they look pretty decent to me as well as
the items in the footer they are sorted
how i would like them to be
with the copyright down at the bottom so
if we click the hamburg icon
and just go to the other pages and see
how they look
you want to check to make sure that
when you're building a website that you
resize it now you can use the
dev tools it's the dev tools it does
have a
mobile setup so if you hit f12 and come
over i believe it's over here
there you go so and you can change it to
the corresponding device that you want
to use
but my personal preference is just to
not do it that way
instead i rather take it out of mobile
mode
and i'd rather just resize the entire
screen
over here and then you're able to see it
how things will look in that resized
uh position and so so far everything is
looking
all right to me and i gotta learn that
that the events goes to a different page
not here
all right so this page is pretty
straightforward i'll probably i
actually will put a heading or header
graphic there
just like this has a heading graphic and
to
complete this section here of the
executive board
and all the scroll bars and everything
else um
but what you don't want to have is a
website that has a horizontal scroll bar
meaning a scroll bar that goes left and
right
because personally i hate having to
scroll left and right even when i write
my code
i don't have it in a way now because i
have it zoomed in it's going to have the
scroll bar here when i pull up this
uh left sidebar but when i do that it
is resized and it doesn't have a
horizontal scroll bar
and just to make sure my lines don't get
too long to prevent that i have this
character
line set at roughly about i believe 80
uh characters or something like that
nature or this it says a hundred and
it says 111 so it's probably setting
like 110 or something like that nature
and that way you get a decent amount of
line you know all the way across
and uh it works but not so far of a line
that it just keeps going and going and
going because i know some people they
like to write
their lines as very long and they end up
having to scroll left and right
up and down that's very difficult in my
opinion to manage it's easier if i can
see
like for instance this could easily span
this text area could obviously run off
the edge of the screen if i would have
put another attribute in here
as you see is right at the edge but i'd
rather be able to see this entire thing
on a single line i mean excuse me on a
single screen
versus having it on a single line but
that is a
prep prince that is usually determined
by each developer
all right
yeah so let's see what page i am missing
i have a photos page it'd be kind of
ironic to not have a
photo on the photos page
maybe that's just me so let's fix that
right quick so i have some existing
photos in here
uh let's copy we'll go with this one so
we just copy it and on the photos page
here we go so using our metadata
image url slash images
i wish we would have copied that didn't
i believe this is this is this one or
this one
actually i'll
yeah so let's copy that all right so
that slash jpg and image alt
all right and so now if we come back to
the photo page
yeah there we go and
alternate text so we do view image info
we got the alternate text
it did not say that is it not
there that is weird all right new page
source if i can do that um i actually do
i'm gonna do inspect element and use the
inspector to
so the alt tag did not show up i wonder
why
oh cause i mistyped alt and this atl
versus alt that's a big difference all
right
so now there we go so we have our alt
text and if we do
image info oops image info
there we go we have the associated text
there all right
f12 on that so that's good
and i'm gonna have to come back and
resize that image anyway because
when you do the full size of that image
it does blow up to
mass proportion um because it's in this
original size
and so i need to scale it down so that
when i run the speed test on this site
once it is deployed to us in production
environment that i get a good speed test
rating
a lot of times you will get a bad speed
test rating
not because of the number of images on
the page but because the size
of the emerald images like resolution
size of the images
are way too high like they're in their
original format and so you have to scale
them down
otherwise your speed scores particularly
for the mobile devices
speed score will be very low
or medium to very low
desktops are usually more tolerant of
that
larger file size because they usually
have higher connection speeds
so usually a 100 megabit or even gigabit
internet versus a mobile phone that does
not necessarily have that
type of connection speed so there's the
difference in that regard
that will wrap things up for this video
going back tomorrow for the last part of
the series where i discuss
the automated deployment setup as well
as do a
final review of the website after it has
been deployed into production
until next time peace out
