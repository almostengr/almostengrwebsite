what's going on good people
so this video will be another coding
challenge
this coding challenge will be doing the
fizz
buzz you've probably heard of this one
before
uh believe it or not i've actually done
this in an interview before i think it
had
different words with it but it was still
the same concept
without further ado let's go ahead and
jump it right into it
[Music]
all right so here is the coding
challenge for this video
and it is to write a program that prints
the numbers from 1 to 100
or for multiples of 3 print fizz
instead of the number and for multiples
of 5
print buzz for multiples which
are for numbers which are multiples of
both three
and five print fizz buzz
that being said uh is
pretty straightforward as you see
there's an example here
so let's go ahead and get right into it
as like with the last coding challenge i
will be doing this
in net core and
all right so now that my system is
decided to start responding once again
um what i'm going to do is i'm going to
open a new
actually i need to create a new project
i've created a repository with all of
these coding challenges in it
so a link to that repository will be
down in the description below
if you've missed a previous coding
challenge all that code will be in the
same repository
i figured i would put all of these
coding challenges into the same
repository that way
um they have a central location for
where
they can be easily found all right so
i'm going to create a new project so
again using the.net core we're going to
do net new
console and we're going to give it a
name of
fizzbuzz
all right and that should create a new
folder called fizzbuzz
as well as set up everything we need for
the project so if we
cd into that directory we have our
project
now let's go ahead and create a
uh get ignore file for this particular
directory that way we don't commit
our project files such as the actual
executables
to the repository now that we have done
that
we can go into visual studio code
into the appropriate directory and open
the project that we just created from
the command line
and then we can open our program.cs i'm
going to update the namespace
to customize it to my particular setup
or how i prefer to do things
and i'm also going to remove the hello
world out of here
and it wants to reboot through the
assets required so we'll go ahead and
click yes on that
and now so we have a program that
prevents prints the numbers from 1 to
100
so what i will do is to create a for
loop
we'll do it i starting with 1
and while i is less than or equal to
100 we will increment
i um this is your basic for loop
and this for loop replies to regardless
of what language that you're doing
um the next step so we need to determine
whether the number that we're currently
on
is a multiple of three a multiple of
five
or a multiple of three and five so the
way i'm going to do this
is to do a uh we'll call it a string
with output and we'll set it to an empty
string
and then if i is
divisible by three then we will
add to that string fizz
all right and uh also do
i know you're thinking well should you
do it else if
no so what i'm going to do is i
is
divisible by 5 then
whoa all right we'll do an
output of we'll do plus
equals here buzz
and looks like i'm missing some quotes
all right and let's see
if i okay i think i may have missed done
this so if we do
i divided by five and that
equals
zero that should work maybe i have the
wrong type of slash
there we go all right so i had the wrong
slash on there
all right and so what we're doing is
we're basically doing division
so if i divided by 3
equals 0 which i don't think this is
quite right i want to use the
modulus operator but it seems to be
complaining about the modulus operator
so
we'll go modu
modu lust operator
c sharp all right and so we'll go to the
internet and kind of look into this a
little bit further to make sure we're
actually using the
right thing um because what i want
is so
let's see
ah okay so we want is we want to do the
modulus so we want
the modulus is basically the
uh mathematical representation of the
remainder so when you're discussing um
so let's say if you have 15 15 divided
by three
would be five with a remainder of zero
and so that's where the modulus comes in
and so uh i i think originally when i
was typing this i did have the i
percent three but i didn't have the
equation of what to check and so it kind
of flagged that let's see
if we go back here um yeah so i didn't
like that because it couldn't
convert that type so this is actual
condition so it can convert that
and so the reason i'm doing it this way
is because
i want the fizz buzz to be able to show
up so you have to do it in a certain way
like i mentioned i've done this in as an
interview question once before
um so it took me a little bit moment but
once i worked with the interviewer and
discussed some things
then we did get it correct and uh
outputted
all right so now that we have our fizz
buzz
portions what i want to do next is
check to see if the output length
is greater than zero and if it is
then well excuse me correction
let's do this so we want to do if the
output link is equal to zero
which means that none of these
conditions were
returned true then we want to set the
output equal to the
i dot tostring value
and then we want to console.writeline
uh the value of output
all right and so don't want to remove
too many braces so if we do
format and trim if i run this
in the terminal
and it may ask me to do some other stuff
before it actually runs off
maybe not all right so it is building it
is now running
there we go all right so we have
one two and if we come and pull up our
image
to kind of do a comparison so we have
one two fizz
four buzz is seven
eight fist buzz 11
is 13 14 fizz buzz
and that's where our example stops at
but the pattern continues forward where
it does the
fizz buzz so let's come back to this
code
and do a little bit more elaborate
walkthrough
so we're basically we're do looping over
the numbers
one through 100 and we're initializing
every time we start with another number
we're going to set the output value to
a empty string which is this here just
two
votes with nothing in the middle and
then we're going to check to see if the
number is divisible by 3 and if so
does it have a remainder if it does have
a remainder it will not
output it will not add fizz to the
output if it is
if it does not have a remainder it will
set that to
the remainder will be zero then it will
add fizz to the output
then here we're going to do the same
thing as we did for three but we're
checking for five
instead and this time since we already
we
may have fizz in the previous check
we want to if this condition is true
we want to add buzz to the output so
we're going to do the plus equals
operator
now this operator is the same as
if you were to do output equals output
plus buzz
all right as soon as i can get it type
so that's the
this condition is the same as this
condition this is just a more concise
way of typing this same statement
all right and then the last check will
be if
the output length so the length of this
variable
is equal to zero which the length
by default would be zero then we know
that
it does not have a fizz or a buzz
contained in it
and so based off of that we can set the
number equal to i mean excuse me we said
the output equal to the number
that was currently being done
in that for loop and then the last part
is to print out that number
to the console all right and so
uh that being said i'll run it once more
again
just so you're able to see it um
if you have any questions regarding this
particular project drop those down in
the comments below
a link to the repository where you can
find the source code for this
will be available also and until next
time
peace out oh and well as you see
it ran successfully again the 99
100 there you go all right
peace out
