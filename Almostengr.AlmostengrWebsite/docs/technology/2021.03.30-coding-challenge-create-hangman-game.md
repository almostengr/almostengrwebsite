what's going on good people
this video will be a coding challenge
video
the challenge is actually a little bit
more difficult than what i'm used to
this particular challenge is to create a
hangman game and as you see here there
is some criteria
of the to do items and
pretty much what the objective is on how
to build out this game
this core example starts off with python
but of course
like in convention we will do this in
c-sharp
using.net core let's get into it
all right i have visual studio code
already pulled up
and all of the existing or prior coding
challenges are available on
github in a repo called coding challenge
link will be provided to
that repository to get started we're
going to
create a net core console
application and i'm going to name it
hang hangman
no sense of overcomplicating the name
and once that project is created
i'm going to go into the hangman
directory
and dot net
core uh get ignore
and that's going to create a get ignore
file
uh oh sorry i forgot the new
keyword so it's dot net new cool dot net
new get ignore
mess that up too all right
let's try this one more time dot net new
get ignored
all right there we go so next i'm going
to
open the repository
or excuse me open the project and i'm
going to
create the programs here open the
program cs file
and then we're going to remove this
statement as well as
update the namespace
to my personal convention
uh you can update the namespace to your
particular convention if you have one
for your applications and while we're at
it we're gonna go ahead and let visual
studio code build out the
necessary files to build and launch
the application all right next thing
up is we're going to take the word list
that is provided in
the example code over here and we're
going to
type it in here um
let's see if we can get both of these
kind of yeah
that works all right and
the word list is an array now mind you
this is in python
so i'm going to stick with an array with
this but
i'm going to name the variables
according to the c sharp syntax
so we got aardvark got baboon
got camel and that will be the end of
that
and then we have our to do one
which randomly choose
a word from the word list and assign
it to a variable uh
let's see if we can stretch this out a
little bit or
assign it to a variable called
chosen word all right to do
two says
to ask
the user to guess a letter and assign
their answer to a variable
called guess and that probably should be
in quotation marks
make guess i think that's the
non-quotation mark version of it
lowercase
and to do number three says to check
if the letter
the user guest
with the guess in parentheses is one of
the
letters in the chosen
word all right
so a little bit complex a lot of
comparisons
that will have to be done to make this
doable
um i'm gonna go ahead and make this
wrap so i don't have that horizontal
scroll bar
and
that should be it okay i'm gonna do
format and we'll trim any trailing
spaces before we get started
that being said we need to randomly
choose a word
from chosen word so we're going to
create a
random object
and using the random class we will place
that there and then we need to get a
random and i misspelled answer here
we will need to get one of these three
words at random from the list
so we will
call a integer or define a integer
wordless
[Music]
ant i think that's
we'll stick with that name may not be
the best name for it but we'll stick
with it
and we'll do a random dot next with zero
being the lowest number and
the max being word list dot
leave this link yes all right and so
that make sure
that and this here will ensure that
the wordless.length that is will ensure
that we are not getting a
word that is outside of the
index of the array that is defined up
here on line 9.
next we need to assign the word
to a variable called chosen word
so create a string
called chosen word and set it equal to
word list with word list
ant embraces and that will get
aardvark baboon and i misspelled baboon
babin isn't i don't believe is a word
but it might be
hard baboon and camel will be placed
into the chosen word item
all right task number two is to ask the
user to guess
a letter and assign their answer to a
variable called
guess make guess lower case so we're
going to do
a string of inputs
input is equal to console dot three line
and we're gonna check that to to lower
and we're going to up here
console.writeline
and set this to enter a
letter
there we go all right and
make it lower case so we've done that
and the variable needs to go
into actually it needs to go into guess
instead of into a
input and since it does say one letter
what we could do is actually use a char
called guess
and because chart will only hold one
letter or number or character and so
that will minimize and make this a
little bit easier to
manage to get um
so it does not like that so we may have
to take this to lower out
so let's go ahead and do that there and
then
uh really
okay so uh well maybe not
since it does not like that being done
that way
unless i can convert this read line to a
char
which i do not believe is possible i can
do a char array
and then get the first item out of that
array so i may do
that instead um
yeah so to get the chart array and then
we'll put that
into a um
char open close and then that'll be
called
yes that should be sufficient and then
for
each um var
guess letter we're going to
guest letter in guess we're going to
do and actually that may not be the
right way to do that
so we'll do for it
i equals 0 i
less than um
guess dot length i plus
plus technically you should only be
accepting one letter in here um so what
i'm gonna do
is i'm gonna take whatever the user
types in
but then what i'm gonna do is actually
only
handle or process the first character
that's in
the full input so if they type 50
characters i'm only going to count the
first one and that will prevent it from
trying to
compare a lot at once
or um having too many values trying to
come through at once
all right so we want the first item
out and so we want to set
the we also want to change this
lowercase because that's the other thing
that we have to do with this
so guess i equals
um guess i
dot two doesn't have a two lower case
on here which is uh i believe is
because the lower case only applies to a
string
and so what may have to do is to
temporarily convert this to a string
and make it lower case then set it back
to a car
[Music]
so we'll create a string uh
for now and then do
temp equals temp dot to lower
there we go and then we will set
the oh and also need to convert this dot
to string
and then let's see can we do guess i
is equal to temp
i may have to do converts on this one
dot char 2 char
yeah and
[Music]
no it's not what i want convert dot
sh
[Music]
oh i had to convert the um
so temp dot string
all right two two string two char array
i'm sorry
all right so now that we've converted
everything back from upper to
lower we converted back to
our array and this may not actually
even need to be done this way um
because
[Music]
we're trying to do a single charge to a
whole thing
that may be a problem so i need to do a
um
let's do a char array that is
actually so if i read this and then do
temp
plus equals now that resets every time
so that's not going to work
all right so i need a temp string
outside of this yes
so we'll do temp there
do a temporary thing here set that to
no value actually set that to an empty
string
to start with and then
yes i said to string equals
10 plus equals temp and
no actually i need to change that to a
lower
and then add it to the
variable and then outside of
that to attempt to
back to guess and handle
that so uh essentially this for loop
will loop over every item in the
array in the character or the guess
array
and from that change all of the values
to lowercase equivalence
and then turn around and put that
into the char array
i'm thinking that's probably the best
route to do this
may actually want to change this up
though to be honest
because it probably doesn't need to be a
char array probably just needs to be
just getting the first one so if we get
the
first
um
item out of here and put that in then we
won't need to convert
everything we just need to convert the
zero index uh
assuming that the zero index is
well assuming that there's something
that has been typed in because if
there's nothing that's been typed in
then
that doesn't matter um so we can just do
that instead of looping through the
entire list of items
so we'll do a string temp let's move
this here
and change adjust the indents
um
better yet i'm thinking well since we're
only supposed to store the guess
and that variable name guess
um what i'm gonna do is leave that there
so we'll call
this a uh char
i can't change a chart to a chart array
so we'll change it to a string
for the um
wait guess and
no so we'll call this input
then we'll do input of zero
is assigned to the string guess
and then from here yes
equals guess dot to lower and we can do
away with that
now that seems to be a little bit more
simplified
for what we're trying to do all right so
now that we have the first character out
of our
string we actually probably want to
check to make sure that the string
is actually has a value here
so i want to do
input dot length
is greater well
yeah greater than zero then we want to
do the stuff inside the if condition
otherwise when you go to run this
and the length is equal to
zero then it will throw
an exception for an index out of bounds
and so obviously knowing that you don't
want to code that in
all right so that should
do that particular part all right so the
to do for number three
is to check if the letter the user guest
is one of the letters in the chosen word
so to do that we'll do if
um chosen word
dot contains and guess
yes okay and
actually guest needs to come outside of
this
uh if statement so we'll do string
guess equals to an empty string
and so if that contains
then console right line
the letter you guess is contained in the
word
all right and obviously there's some
more logic that needs to go in here
um but i'm just putting these statements
here for now so
that we know what should go in each of
these statements
the letter and then i can do a
uh the replacement string here
is not contained in the word
and then we'll do guess as that
value then we'll come back up here
guess and letter
there we go is contained in the word got
it
all right so now that we have
this existing logic well this logic in
place
what we want to do is to go ahead and
build it
and make sure that what we have is
running
thus far and also that it will build
thus far
but you will know though is that this
will not
repeat um once i put a letter in
so if i type a letter um
we'll do a capital p
and for some reason i have issues with
this working in
visual studio code so let me open a
terminal and run this application
all right so i want to do dot net
run from here and it should present the
same information
of asking for a letter to be entered i'm
gonna do an uppercase p
and it says the letter p is not
contained in the word
um we do not know which word that it
picked so we probably want to add that
piece of
information to the output as well as
the application uh that we're running
because that's not also being output so
we'll say welcome to
hangman will be a capital h
and we want to say
[Music]
all right so we have the chosen word so
we can do console.writeline
and say that the word
has and we'll do
a replacement there characters
and with that we'll do
chosen word dot length
for the substitution value so now if we
come back over to our terminal and run
this again
before enter a letter shows up on the
screen it should say
the word that we're looking for and so
given that we only have three words it's
pretty obvious which word that we're
looking for
and so the last time we typed p and we
confirmed that p was not in the word uh
whichever word it was but this time we
actually know where it
was which word it is because we can see
the words
and so we can type a letter in here uh
we'll go ahead and type a
and actually i'm going to type uppercase
a just to make sure that the
lowercase comparison is doing
correctly and so the letter a
is contained in the word and as you see
it also dropped the
lowercase or got the lowercase
equivalent
of that so that is working i did notice
that the punctuation was missing so
i'm going to add that in right now while
i see it
all right now we need this to continue
to
loop over instead of exiting like it's
currently doing so what i'm gonna do
is to include a while loop
and i'm going to wrap that while loop
around
this to do and for
starters i'm gonna just default it to
true just so that the error messages go
away but i'm actually going to fix that
here shortly
so that it um
only actually is a legit while loop
condition
and so what we need to do is that we
need to
normally in hangman you have a number of
tries so
to do this number of tries you need to
find a variable that does the number of
tries or
counts the number of tries we're going
to call the int tries
spelling this are uh yeah we call it
entries
and um or guess attempts
would probably be more appropriate and
we're going to initialize that to seven
and then so while guess
attempts is greater than zero because
once you hit zero
then you're out and we want
to see that if the guess
is not uh if the word is not correct
then we want to remove the guess
remove one of the guest attempts
okay so since we also have the guest
attempts
we'll want to print the number of
guesses remaining
to the screen so we'll do
console.writeline
remaining
attempts and
we'll do the placement of the variable
in there
and semicolon and actually i'm go ahead
and rename this to
remaining attempts
because it seems i'm trying to get away
from using the same
uh variable because we already have
guess as a
variable down here so when it comes to
typing
you'll try to make your variables fairly
distinct that way
if you have for example if you have
string guess
2 well when you go to type
somewhere down here guess it's going to
auto auto
excuse me it's going to uh use the
intellisense and intellisense is going
to throw
whichever one it thinks you might be
trying to type which in
most scenarios for me uh doesn't
necessarily make it to the correct one
so i'm going to rename that
for that reason all right now if we
um come over here and run this
and it will build all right so
we have all the information welcome to
hey man the word has six characters
and enter a letter so we have let's say
we're looking for
t letter t is not contained in the word
and as we also see
the remaining attempt has dropped down
by one
to six and if we keep doing this
and if you don't put anything in there
the remaining attempts remains the same
which is what we want
um
letter is not contained in the word and
if we exit the loop
we need to put a condition there that
checks to see what happens after we exit
the loop
because there should be two conditions
where you exit the loop if you run out
of attempts or
if you get the word correct so right now
we're working on the
attempts portion all right so if
remaining attempts
is equal to zero and
we want to console.writeline
you have ran out of attempts
you lose
and i know that's kind of a crude error
uh it's a crude message but that's
essentially what has happened
all right that being said um
the next part we can work on is actually
doing the comparisons for if the guess
is contained in the word
so how do we do
that um so we need to get
the
uh we need to also be able to display
the word
to which is a little bit complex um
but i'm thinking we probably need to do
the display in a separate function
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna build
it out within this if condition
and then take that statement once it's
built out in if condition and move it
over to a function
where that would make sense and so
i'm gonna go ahead and move this over to
a function as well
so we're going to extract a
i believe it's extract method so that
will take that to a
separate method and
[Music]
pass that in and so if we come back up
here
and say exit
game as the name of the function
and
we'll put all of the stuff that needs to
be printed out to the screen
inside of this exit game function and
therefore you get a more concise
uh loop and or main
we'll continue that a little bit further
and then um
we could also leverage some class
variables here too because we're using
this function instead of passing
these arguments in so what i'm going to
do is actually make
this remaining attempt into a
[Music]
if it'll let me do a cut it's not a
constant
um
well one move it near the reference
because it doesn't make sense that it's
that far up uh
all right now let's see if it'll let me
do a
not letting me do it so i'm just gonna
have to force my way to do it
we're going to declare a static variable
with that in it
all right and therefore if i have a
static variable
i do not need to pass the value in
because
the function the variable
is because it's in the class it now
knows what it is
and so i don't have to do that um
but that also means any function outside
of domain can
modify this value which may or may not
be a good thing depending on
how you're writing your code but it's
fine in this case
all right so now that we have our
remaining temps
configured correctly um
the next step is to handle the
correct guesses so we have it checking
that if the letter is there then that is
correct so
we need to do a
comparison of the
we also need to track the letters that
we already have guessed
so let's do a um
i want to declare another
thing i want to declare another string
array that says already
guest letters
and actually no that can't be an array
so it have to be a list and the
reason being that it would have to be a
list
is because that if it is an array
that array will not uh hold the values
in place so what i need to do is to
do list of not word lists
string and we'll call it already guest
letters equals new list of string
[Music]
and we need to import a collection
statement there
for that which is
[Music]
system.collections.generic
and
let's see what else all right so we have
that so we want to
anytime we type a letter
in we want to add that to
the list of already guest
letters so we're going to do already
guess letters dot add
and we want to add after we drop it to
the
lower case or convert it to lowercase
then we want to add it to guess
or add guess to it excuse me all right
and let's see
so that is correct um
one other thing that i noticed that i
probably want to go ahead and
make it a little bit more difficult to
make this
a problem in the future is so the word
list is already lower case
but let's say somebody comes up in here
and types a capital a in here instead
well then we still wanted to remain
lower case so i'm gonna do
dot two lower on this uh
setting of the word to chosen word that
way that ensures that
even if somebody does type a uppercase
letter here that it is handled
properly all right so we're adding our
already guessed letters to
the list and then we need to do a
comparison
of the already guessed letters
versus the um
not already guess letters
what i'm thinking so
um let me change this back for the sake
of uh the way it should have been
and already guessed letters so i want to
i think we need to do
a for loop on
um you probably also need a
variable up here that call uh
that is a string that is called
visible letters
and we'll set that to that and then we
want to set
the divisible letters
equal to wait 1 2 a 4
each var letter
[Music]
in uh
actually no yeah before each in
chosen word we want to set
visible letters
plus equals to star
and that will be our masking
of the letters um
trying to think is that the correct that
may or may not be the correct way to do
it but this is one way that you can do
this
what i'm thinking is we may just need to
cycle through each of the letters and if
the letter has not already been guessed
then that letter is replaced in the
output before it is displayed to the
screen
and that way we know which
letter um we don't have to keep track of
the
word in multiple well we may still need
to do it in multiple variables
won't be as difficult all right
so
let's see
oh for each letter in chosen word
uh or for each um
yeah so for each letter
um in already guessed
honestly
we want to start with the letters that
are already visible and
create a temporary string that will set
so we'll do a
um
call a string display word
set that the empty and then for each
letter
in chosen word
we will do a comparison
so if
letter is equal to
letter let's see no if
trying to think already guess letters
dot
contains and then letter
then and we'll make that a if statement
i've already guessed letters contains
letter
uh with the letter passed in
is that correct
then we will add letter to the output
so we'll call this uh or display so
display word
plus equals letter
and if it does not else
we'll do display word
plus equals asterix and i think that's
the proper way of doing that
um what is wrong with this letter can i
convert
char to string got it
so convert that to string with the
parentheses
that should handle that
all right and so let's see what this
does
i want to remove this for the time being
because i know i'm not going to need it
and we'll come back over to our terminal
window
do clear and then do dot net run
all right the variable visible letters
is never used
hmm okay that's fine
i noticed i misspelled it too so
uh we'll comment that out for the time
being as well all right so
our letter excuse me our word has eight
letters
uh we will have seven attempts enter a
letter
um so let's do an o
all right so o is not included in the
word six remaining attempts now i
noticed something
that the display is not printing out
which it should be so that is a problem
so
let's move the display word
um the display word needs to be reset
every time
it also needs to be visible where it
could be
fined
[Music]
so this way word contains guess
as i'm looking at this i think i
actually have the same condition in here
or than i should because the same
function is going to be
called in either scenario
[Music]
and i need the display word to be kept
in between cycles um
so we'll do display word
and i need another console right line
because what i want to have happen
is see how these are all crammed up
right next to each other i don't want
that to happen
so what i'm gonna do is to after each
attempt
um so remaining attempts is
six remaining attempts remaining
attempts so i'm gonna add another
console.writeline
and just put a blank line there actually
i don't even need
quotes there just do it empty and that
should do
the same thing all right um
now you could do all kinds of other kind
of formatting like separating it with
equals or not
i'm keeping it simple so blank line will
do in this particular
case all right so now that we have
guest letters and so chosen word
contains
yes then
um and we may need to change this logic
all together may rather
need to do it this way instead of the
other way
um i'll leave it there for now
all right so
we need to reset this way word
each time we come through and guess the
right
thing so what i'm gonna do is do display
word
it's equal to empty string
um because if you keep appending to it
then
it won't be pretty after the second go
around
and at the end of the loop need to do
console
dot writeline and display work
and that should be
that all right so let's try this again
clear the terminal run the application
and let it build so
now we have our space there so let's go
ahead and type and
oh all right so the letter o is not
contained in the word
got it so let's type in a it's still not
printing
my the actual word so that is a problem
because it should be still displaying
actual words
so we may need to copy
this here and put this there
all right so let's exit and try that run
again
oops close ring let's run again
let's put the letter o all right so
now we're getting our word here
so let's put the letter a and see what
happens
all right so we got the letter a and our
attempts remained the same
that's correct so we put the letter d
we got our d what is it
aardvark goes r
we got our r and then we got a k
and a v and we've spelled our word
now only thing is a display word
is the same as the
actual contained word but we don't have
a condition in our
loop that would exit out
that being said so we need to do
if remaining attempts is greater than
zero
and if
display word is
not equal to uh
nachos yeah chosen word i believe this
is the correct way of doing this
and then so if
remaining attempts is equal to zero and
then i want to put another statement
here
and have it say it could be an else
statement here but i'm gonna do it this
way if
display and i don't have display word
there
so i probably will use an else statement
here just to simplify this
so if you're exiting the game that means
you've done one or two things you've
either gotten it wrong or
you've gotten it right right line
so you have won the game
um and say you have yeah you have won
the game that should be sufficient
all right so coming back over here
let's do a clear dot that run
and hopefully this time uh
get it right so our six letter word in
our example is baboon
so we can put a capital t in here for
the sake of it
and the letter t is not contained in the
word now one thing we did not test but
it should still work
is if we put a number or a special
character and i know you can't make
letters and numbers out of special
characters and there is a way to check
that and make that possible but for the
sake of this
we are not going to add that logic we
pretty much figure out if you put
something in here that you shouldn't put
in
it's not going to work or it will be
wrong
so i put a pound sign in here and the
letter pound granted that's not a letter
um so we may need to change that output
statement
is not contained in a word so now that
we have that there
and i'm noticing something here is the
original word has
six asterisks here now this word has
six plus six which is 12. so
the condition to
uh if your word is wrong
is not doing something correct now i
believe it's because it's not resetting
the display word here so
we needed to reset the display word
regardless of where it's at
so we need to move it up to here
instead and
i'm going to comment that out for the
time being
and then this here really needs to be a
function because it is the same logic
for both statements so i'm just going to
go ahead and select that now
do control dot and do extract
method and so we're going to call
this method um
check this way i guess we call it um
not check display let's see uh
[Music]
process
display word
all right and i know that's a mouthful
but essentially that is what it's
doing and so since this is the same as
this down here
it's going to go ahead and copy paste
that there
format and trim and then
save so if we go back to our terminal
and we'll try to run this again and make
sure that that
is correct
all right so we have a five letter word
a five-letter word in this example is
camel
so camel does not have an r in it so if
we type r
uh we get our five asterisks which we
still
should still have and then also have one
less
remaining attempt camel does have an m
and we'll put it uppercase m in here for
the sake of it it still should pass
and it does and we still have six
remaining
c a let's do uh
q for the sake of just because and
e l camel
so we have gotten the word and we have
won the game
um now if you want to you can take this
a little bit further and actually do the
drawing
of the hangman part um i mentioned that
earlier
but i probably won't do that on this
particular video because of the fact
of drawing characters or ascii
characters
does take a little bit of effort um so
let's walk back through the code one
more time before we close out the video
all right so we have our welcome to
hangman opening here
um we have our word list this word list
can be longer
just add more animals so dog
you gotta do it in quotation marks dog
elephants
um ferrets
uh efg so um
giraffe there we go all right
so we have one letter
for the first one two three four five
six seven
letters of the alphabet that should be
sufficient and then we did our two do
one which is
randomly choose a word from the list and
assign it to a variable called chosen
word
so that's what we've done with these
four lines here
um we've had to add some additional
variables here because of the fact we
need to have those for our while loop
and
we also added the uh remaining attempts
so that you know how many times you have
remaining before you lose the game
and then enter a letter so we need that
information to prompt to the user
for what for them to do something then
you take that guess
and process it accordingly get the first
letter out of there
if they put multiple characters in there
it is possible you could handle that but
for the sake of simplicity
in this example we're only going to
handle that with the by grabbing the
first letter out of this string
and do already guess letters with ad
and um
i actually come think of it i may
actually have made a mistake
i realize this condition may actually
take
[Music]
um
an error message i mean excuse me blank
string and
decrement the steps or decrement the
remaining attempts but we'll have to
test that again
so already guess letters you add that to
the guest the letters that have been
guessed
and then if the word is chosen contains
the guess then
that letter is contained in the word and
we will
process the display word so that is a
number of arguments that are passed in
and you loop over each
letter in the chosen word and to see if
that's there and so if
if it is there you display that letter
if not you show an asterisk in its place
and then return this back
to the caller um and then inside of that
that would be
it if you're doing this same set of
stuff inside of the else condition you
would decrement the
remaining attempts and you would display
the word uh regardless of you know
asterisk letter combinations or just
asterisks only
once you get done with the while loop
you will exit the game
and that exit game comes down here and
it determines whether you had zero
remaining attempts and if you did have
zero remaining attempts
that means you ran out of attempts and
you have lost the game um
if you have remaining attempts that
means you have won the game
and one thing you probably want to also
do here is do a console.right line
and say the word was and then print out
what the word was
so um because usually
if you lose you find out what the word
is
and so what we want to do is we'll
probably have to set
chosen word as
so i set that one as a class variable
i don't know if i want to do that well
i'll go ahead and pass that
in here as a class variable so
um string
um the word that's what i'll call this
one here
we'll wrong function all right
so that there so therefore
if you run out of attempts you do still
find out what the word is
and so now that we made that one
adjustment
let's do uh net run one final time
so we have seven a seven character seven
character word and seven remaining
attempts
so to enter a letter we're gonna do uh
we'll put an h in there the letter h
is not contained in the word um
so most of the words if not mistaken all
of the words
well most of the words have the letter a
so we can put a letter a in there all
right so the letter a
is in the word and i think i know what
the word is based off what i've already
entered
letter g i
r a f and there's two of those
and we're gonna intentionally run out
of letters even though we're so close
and i kind of noticed something that
well that's working correctly
so if you put the same letter in twice
uh as you see here i have a
and i already had a in the previous go
around it does not count off
against your attempts because that
letter already existed
so that's something to keep in mind
normally if you already guess a letter
that's already been guessed then
you have a output that says that letter
has already been guessed
and that logic can be added in here too
as a if condition
all right so continuing on let's finish
out so that we run
out of attempts and
just gotta make sure i type letters all
right so
here we have it you have ran out of
attempts you lose the word
was giraffe and as you can kind of
figure out that's kind of what it was
based off the other guesses so that
wraps that up for this
video this video took a little bit
longer than the previous coding sessions
all the coding sessions won't
necessarily be quick but um
yeah this one hopefully you have learned
a little bit um
i know there are some video tutorials on
hey this can be done in 10 minutes and
more than likely those 10 minute videos
are because of the fact they've already
practiced it a number of times and
they're just regurgitating that on video
to have it done in a concise manner as
you can see
it took a decent amount of time and a
lot of walking it through
to get it to do what it needs to do so
while you see those tutorials that may
say i can do this in five minutes i can
do it in 10 minutes
actuality they probably practice it two
or three times beforehand
and then was able to go back and record
it in the five to 10 minutes that you
actually ended up seeing
so any questions drop those in the
comments this will
probably not be the last of the coding
challenges that i face
and uh want to share with you so any
questions comments
comments uh the repository information
will be provided so you can look at the
source code for this
until next time peace out
