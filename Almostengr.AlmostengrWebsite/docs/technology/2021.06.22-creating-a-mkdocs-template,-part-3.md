## Transcript (Unedited)

between the last part
and this part of the video series i was
not able to
figure out how to get the jumbotron to
only show
for one piece of content that is
available
so instead i'm going to take a different
approach to
that particular problem and continue
building out the template for the mk
docs website or blog that i'm building
here we go
[Music]
all right so we're going to go ahead and
jump right back into it
all right here we were last from the
last part of the series
we're working on the jumbotron to get it
to show
just for the first piece of content
instead i'm going to actually
change the logic in here that
post this jumbotron so i'm gonna leave
what's in here here
but instead i'm going to actually add an
attribute
in the page that will check to see if
the item is set
to be the featured piece of content and
if it is set to be
the feature piece of content then it
will
show on the page
and what i'm going to do so i'm going to
use nav child
meta featured so that value
does exist
it will put the it
as the jumbotron and the only thing is
i'll just have to make sure that there
are not
two pages in here that have the
feature tag as the jumbotron
uh i mean excuse me there are not two
pages that have
the featured uh meta
attribute set and that should be fairly
difficult to do
just got to make sure you got to
remember what's there and
remove the other one so i'm going to say
feature
true it could be yes it could be one
whatever value goes there because
they're not going to actually display
the value
we're just putting a value there so that
it knows that something needs to be
shown there all right and so here we
have our one
piece of content here now let's go back
to
the page here and we're going to
actually change
the title and we're going to say
nav child i'm going to
nav child title and actually need to put
that in braces
title and
i want to also put in the
link to this particular page so we're
going to do
nav child dot url
we're going to pipe that to url which is
a special
filtering mechanism that is used in the
ninja templating engine and then
for this one i'm going to actually use
the um
i'm actually going to make this an if
condition here
and what i want to do is actually put in
the description for this page
so we're going to take that out and
we're going to check to see
if the uh actually don't need two braces
we just need one if nav child
dot description excuse me now that meta
dot description
then you're going to display the
dab child dot meta
dot description and
if there is nothing else there then
we're going to
do what was done down here
with the truncating of the
nav child content
and i need to close this out so
do and if with the parentheses there
all right now here we have it and it's
working correctly so we have the title
of our post
as well as the description of said post
and how we're triggering that is again
in the content
we have a true flag
in the meta here for featured and so
with that there anytime that flag is
there it will show true
so the only thing is you just got to
make sure that you don't have it set
in that featured meta attribute
in multiple places otherwise you will
get multiple
jumbotrons showing on the home page all
right
and to check the link so it does point
to the
red mountain park post and and going
down
you'll see at the top of the page here
we actually have the post show
the title of the page showing up twice
and that's something i'm gonna have to
fix
next so if we go back to
the this particular section here
and here we have
the page title and what it's doing is
actually the page title is
in the body content or the page content
of that page and so what's happening is
it's pulling the title and saying okay
i see the title but then i'm posting it
again because it's in the
content or the body of the page and
that's how we
are getting this double page heading
so what i need to do is actually to put
a condition in here
so that this does not happen
and what i need to do is to actually
so we need a if condition and
um so i'm actually going to surround
this block here
and the reason being i'm going to do it
this way is because if the page title
is not in the metadata then it's going
to show up in the body
and what will happen is that actually
will show up
kind of weird in nature on the page
so i want to actually enclose all of
that into a single block
that if the title is in the page itself
and not
in the metadata that is not showing
all of this and coming out with a weird
output like this
the long-term fix would be to actually
go back and correct
the content that is
set up this way so that we don't have
that problem
going forward but right now i'm gonna go
ahead and code this fix in
as i want to be able to show you all how
to do this on your particular
setup what we're going to check is if
the
page dot meta dot title attribute
does exist and
[Music]
we want to do page dot
meta dot title
and then we also want to show the
metadata
and i'm putting all of that the h2 and
everything else
in here inside like this for a
on purpose um really this actually
should also come think of it should be a
h1
not an h2 because it is the page title
so now that i've corrected that i'm
going to go ahead and get this to
correct that
and i have saved the page so if we go
back
and refresh it
let's see did i mistype something oh so
i have the title here as well as
that so what i need to do is also make
another condition in here
that will uh
if the metadata title is present and
[Music]
i guess that's that yeah
what i actually need to do is just
remove it here from the page
and that should correct that issue that
with the title showing twice and as you
see it has
now what i was talking about earlier is
let's put that back temporarily and
remove this one
and it should now not show the credits
and it doesn't as you see it just only
shows the title
and that's what i want it to do
all right so let's remove this and we
also need to
[Music]
change this to posted
i like to also have updated on here
updated 2020 what's today 20 20
uh 09.06 is the
current date and time and if we go back
to here
so we have the posted date and time
and then i also want to include the
updated date and time because sometimes
you'll write a post
but then that posts you something in
that post is incorrect or
the data in there has changed or
something of that nature
and if that's the case i want to make
those necessary updates so i'm going to
do
if condition meta dot
uh updated so past tense
and then i want to do similar to how i
have
the above element with the posted date
so
page.meta.updated
and then do a closing and if
on this the jinjo2 template does have
a date time available in here where
you can do a filtering of a time pattern
i don't do that
but if you wanted to you could do that
and i'm also going to put updated here
so that you clearly know that this is
the updated time
and i want to put
yeah okay so if the updated time updated
date rather
that's been provided then there it is
all right
and let's see
i think that is sufficient so should be
good
so here we have the date posted by
who yours truly and updated
on today at the time of this recording
and so here's that full post that you
have there
all right so let's go back to the home
page so we have our featured content up
here
which is pretty great
and we have our list of posts down here
um
i actually think i want to get rid of
this sidebar and probably actually move
this
to a separate page that way i have a
single column
website that is capable of
well it's already bootstrapped so it can
already resize for any type of device
that is being used for but i wanted to
be able to have a single column website
that way it's less to manage because
when you have the sidebars over here
it's somewhat a little bit more complex
but not severely complex bootstrap makes
it a little bit easier
to deal with that being said
i'm going to actually move so we can
move this elsewhere block
down to the bottom of
the page so let's go and grab this
content
block here or this div
and i want to move it
within the nav so here's the closing div
for the main navigation section or
excuse me the
main page body and i'm going to take
this class off because i don't well i'm
going to leave that class there
and i want to actually add a
horizontal row here class
uh call it order
border danger i believe is what i'm
looking for
here with this one and let's see if we
get a red line there
yes so now that i have that there i can
actually go
and take these two blocks off the side
and just comment that section
and i actually need to let's move that
down a line
and now see there we go
comment that section almost not quite
okay i guess because i have the
commented section in the middle
that when i try to hit the shortcut it's
not
liking it so much so
now that we have that out of the way we
need to actually
come up here and change the
div on this container
[Music]
to take up the full width of the screen
and there you have it
all right now if i have some additional
blocks i can drop these down here at the
bottom if i choose
which is what i think i'm gonna do i'm
actually going to uh
spaces out and put a
bg we'll go with light on this one
just to see how it looks and i'm
probably going to do
a empty div
[Music]
between the main and
go back to class with a
i believe it's a margin if not
is padding to get kind of a gap yeah and
it's kind of difficult to see
let me change that to
vg dark so you can see it a little bit
better
all right so you see there's white space
in between the x
the footer and then this next block or
section of the
page another thing about it i don't like
that red line there
if i have this darker background here
and so that
will get things through this particular
page
i mean excuse me this particular section
um the next thing that i'm gonna have to
do
is actually go back through and check
the
links on the page and the reason being
is because i move the content around
that's kind of more of a manual process
you could write a shell script that
would be able to handle that
and i may actually end up doing that in
this case
um but it's a little bit more difficult
to do
and whatnot and so i want to test out
the bootstrap part of this
where it may show where it will resize
and as you see it's resizing
pretty well and let's open this back out
all right so for the there was a nav
section up here at the top
that was commented out earlier i'm
actually go ahead and bring it back
okay not sure what i did
all right so here we go so let's try to
bring this
back
and in case you're wondering i actually
use visual studio
at uh sometimes
and so as you see me typing this some of
the shortcuts in visual studio are
slightly different than those in visual
studio code
and so you'll see the screen randomly
jump is because i actually hit the wrong
shortcut and so it's doing something
completely different than what i
intended um just know i'm not just
messing up things
on purpose here all right so
next i'm going to disable some of this
stuff here for
right now and i'm going to actually go
ahead and change some of these
uh links that are here so go about
and do contact on this one
and just as a helpful tip if you do not
have
about or contact pages on your website
google will actually
penalize you for the lack of those pages
because it considers those two pages to
be
critical for every website
again about and contact pages are
critical for every website according to
google
that being said create them even if you
don't have a lot of content on them you
need to create them
and have links to them from
pretty much any page on the site because
as google crawls the site
it will look for those pages and if
you're trying to come up in the blogging
world
those two pages and seo will be a
critical
factor in what you are able to
get in terms of seo rankings
as you see i don't have any contact on i
mean content
on my contact or any content on my about
pages i will be fixing that but not
in the video all right and if i wanted
to add other
categories or sections to the site i
could do that
i'll probably go back and tweak this so
that i have
pages for each category and have them
to be able to be accessed from the
navigation bar
up here as you see but right now the
remaining text will remain there
it'll just be commented out and i really
want to
i don't want to have this justified with
the content in between i really want it
centered so i'm going to change this to
text center and if i come back
uh looks like i got the wrong bootstrap
[Music]
class
is it centered i believe it might be
center
oh okay
uh a line item center maybe that's what
it
all right so yeah
justify okay it looks like i'm missing
i have somewhere i thought i had it
maybe i don't
okay let me go look back into
other code and see this is one of the
main reasons that you want to be able to
keep
your existing code so text center does
exist
okay maybe it's just not working for
this
this is one of the main reasons you want
to be able to keep your existing code
and be able to reference your existing
code because
sometimes you may make a mistake like
this or
you know have some uncertainty like this
and it's still justifying which i'm not
sure why and it might be because of this
flexboxes here
and that's fine i will just remove that
for now
um well worst case scenario you can go
to
the bootstrap website and
reference the information that they have
there
about the classes and so forth so if you
go to documentation
text alignment is what i am looking for
and text center is the correct
thing that i should be using but for
reasons that i don't understand
um and it might again might be because
of this d flex
let's see what happens with that if i
take that out
and take this out and replace it with
the text center
all right so it's still justifying to
the left and if i do
margin auto
margin x auto i believe this is
okay still not doing what i wanted to do
that's fine
i will actually just undo this for the
time being because i do have
these other links that i also want to
leverage in here so it'll be fine if i
put those more links in there but right
now with it spaced out
you know all the way across the screen
like that it's kind of a
looks kind of weird that you got those
two links so far apart from each other
all right and let's see what else can we
do
so i do want to monetize this site
what i will do is i will put another
block down here i'm not going to do that
on video
because of the amount of stuff i had to
go through to get to
the monetization code but it essentially
would be another block
that goes down here on the page or even
at the
bottom of the page here that you can put
a
ad banner there
if you have a blog i do recommend
suggesting monetizing your blog
and that way you're able to make some
money you may not make a lot of money
off of it
but you are making some money off the
content that you are creating
however if you're not interested in
monetization don't worry about it
but it's an easy way to make a little
bit of passive income you know
even if you're only getting five bucks a
month five bucks
can probably get you a lunch or a snack
or something
you know for your efforts and your
knowledge sharing and it's also kind of
uh
in my opinion a good way of using that
to your advantage because
you're able to the more the more
content that you create that is useful
to the
community whichever community you're in
whether you're in technology whether
you're in gardening
the more content that you create and the
more people you bring to your site
the more money you get in return because
of that
and so i just kind of see it as a
positive picture for that
so in the end i'm going to go ahead and
close out this series
if you want to check out the sites once
i finish everything completely
completely
like the bulk of the work is done if you
want to see final tweaks and so forth
that i've done
you can go check out this particular
blog it'll be a link down
in the description below this blog is
hosted on my github page or github
on my github pages and you can check it
out
you can also look at the finalized
template
that source code will also be available
in the
uh almost encr.github.io
repository again the link to that will
be down in the description below
hopefully you have good success in
building your site out
and i've given you some insight into how
to build a template
using mk docs with the ninja templating
engine if you have any questions put
them down below
i do read the comments i do answer the
