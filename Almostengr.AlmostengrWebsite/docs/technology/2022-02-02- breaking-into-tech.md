Yesterday I attended a session about breaking into tech. 
This is a topic that I see asked on Black Tech Twitter and
various tech Facebook groups that I'm in. However,  I've never seen it
explained in the manner like I saw at this session. 

Background about this session is that majority of the people that attended were already in tech including myself. 
Most of us was there because they wanted to network and to just be a part of the tech community. 

## Personal Thoughts



## Presenters Perspective 

One of the presenters drew the diagram on the board and elaborated on how to get into tech.
