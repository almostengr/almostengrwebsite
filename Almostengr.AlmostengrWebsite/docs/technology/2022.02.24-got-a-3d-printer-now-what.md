An individual that know from the community reached out to me and said that he wanted to donate a 3D printer
that he had to my NSBE chapter. This was unexpected and I had zero idea of what we could do with it. 
Since this was my first experience with a 3D printer, everything was a puzzle. 

## Assembly

The donor had issues with getting it working, which I was able to fix. After going through the provided 
assembly instructions, I realized that some of the assembly was done incorrect, which 
contributed to the printer not working. The assembly instructions didn't cover all the steps to fully 
assemble the printer, thus had to turn to the internet for answers. After typing in the brand and model name,
which I found out was another brand name that was rebadged, I then started finding answers to why 
the extruder wasn't working correctly. The instructions was missing the assembly step for the extruder, thus 
it wasn't properly connected. Looking at a clip from a YouTube video, I was able to get the extruder properly 
connected and working. 

## Filament

The printer came with a roll of filament.
