As some of you may know, I run two YouTube channels. One is 
<a href="" target="_blank">Robinson Handy and Technology Services</a>, which I talk about tech, 
do it yourself repairs and builds, and a bit more. 
The other is 
<a href="" target="_blank">Kenny Ram Dash Cam</a>, which is where I upload dash cam videos of my 
travels and bad driving habits of others that I see. 

One thing that you eventually find out from running a YouTube channel, is that making videos 
requires a bit of patience, lot of disk storage, and editing videos is not as easy as some 
of the professionals make it out to be. Thus where automation comes in to speed up the content 
creation process. 

Been doing videos for YouTube for about 4 years now and it has been a lot to learn. Researching 
what other videographers do and how they go about making their videos has been helpful. For me, 
I wanted to find a more efficient way of creating content that also allowed me to be able to 
use my time more wisely. As I mentioned in a previous blog post about 
[switching to a static website](#) to reduce the amount of time that I spent on maintaining 
the website, the video creation process would follow along those same lines... 
simplify the process. 

The way that I made videos, they are done in clips. Make a mistake in a clip, redo it and 
delete the clip that has the mistake. This contradicts what most videographers and producers suggest, 
as they say to leave the camera rolling and cut out the bad parts in post production. I have 
tried that method and it works when you are willing to put in the time to do the editing or 
have a dedicated team that will do the editing for you. For me, that was time consuming and 
took away from the ability to create content, which resulted in not being consistent in posting 
new content, which resulted in slow growth on my YouTube channel. Talk about cause and effect. 

Now that I have these individual clips, I would then have to load them to my computer and 
combine them using Kdenlive. For those that are not familiar with Kdenlive, it is very prone to 
crashing when you least expect it and thus you have to save and save often. While in Kdenlive, 
would then have to edit out the oops and bad parts, which means that you have to go through the
entire video. Thus a 10 minute video could take an hour or two to edit depending on the number of 
mistakes that were in the video. Again... time consuming. 

After doing some research, I found that Kdenlive used a program called Melt to render videos. Kdenlive
creates a XML file that is then passed to Melt when rendering is called. Looking 
into that led me down a path where I found out about ffmpeg to create videos. Looking into ffmpeg 
more I found that it can do a number of options and how to make it take multiple videos and 
put them into a single video and a bit more. 

I got to thinking... since most of the time I am recording these individual clips, I could create 
a Shell Script that can merge the clips into a single video. Thus I created 
a shell script that could do all of that and bit more. 

With Kdenlive, you can create an archive of a video project so that all of the clips, audio, effects, 
and more can be saved as a backup. In the future, if you needed to regenerate or edit that video 
project, you can unpackage the contents of the archive and make the necessary edits in Kdenlive 
that you needed. 

Following that same strategy, I set up the script to do the following in the order listed: 

* loop through all of the tar files in the incoming directory
* uncompress (if needed) and extract the contents of the tar file into a working directory
* since the name of the video is the file name of the tar file, the tar file name is parsed and 
used to create the video title so that it can be used to named the output files 
* look at the contents of the tar file to determine what channel the video is being created for.
