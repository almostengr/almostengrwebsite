The Great Resignation. It is a term that has become more popular with the number of people 
that are quiting their jobs because of the shift in the work culture. 

## Break That Lease

## Those At The Top Never Worked From Home

It is ysually Boomers (1946-1964) or Generation X (1965-1980),
that are making the corporate and staffing decisions, most likely 
never had the opportunity to work from home. Those that have worked from home did so, 
because they had a deadline that needed to be met and could not 
[finish their work](/technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support#work-your-hours-and-leave)
during normal business hours. 

It is also this same generation of people that believe that you must be in an office,
warehouse, restaurant, department store, or wherever in order to be able to do your work 
and to be productive at doing your work.

Thing about this is COVID, Millennials, and Generation Z have all proved that this is 
far from the truth. Number of people have reported that they have been able to get more 
work done working from home than working in an office. This is even more true for 
most people in tech roles as they only need an internet connection and a computer 
to be able to do their work.

More productive than at home? How is that possible? Believe or not, it is true that one 
can be more productive at home than in an office. Here are some of the common reasons why, 
including some of my personal reasons.

### Control of the Thermostat

If you keep a heater in your office or keep a jacket in your office, 
then you know what I am talking about. 

### Control of the Lighting

Fluorescent lighting has been a topic of back office environments 
since the 1980s when it was wide scale adopted and introduced. It has a lower operating costs 
than incandscent bulbs, and thus is perferred. On the contrary, these lights have been 
known to cause eye strain. 

I have personally experienced this. I could work from home all day on the computer and not have 
any issues with my eyes because I allowed the natural sunlight to illuminate my home office. At the 
work office, the blinds where often closed because they caused a glare on the screens and thus 
the fluorescent bulbs illuminated the office. This resulted in having burning eyes from eye 
strain and dry eye. If I did not wear my computer glasses, my eyes would remind me to put them 
on after a couple of hours. 

### Control of the Interruptions

As a programmer, getting into a working groove means you can figure out any coding issue quick, fast,
and in a hurry. On the contrary, that one coworker comes up to talk about the Monday night football 
game in the middle of your groove, and immediately your groove is gone. That's right, you have been 
interrupted. 

[To cut the number of interruptions](/technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#visual-distractions)
that I would experience, I made adjustments to the computer 
notifications, playing music via headphones, and would often delay responding to people until I 
got to a point that I was comfortable with taking a break.
