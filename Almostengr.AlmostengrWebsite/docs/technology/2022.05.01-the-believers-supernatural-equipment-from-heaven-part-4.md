Notes from church service

* use a framework and not a formula
* dependence on the Holy Spirit is non negotiable 
* there are 7 prespectives

## Principle 

* Psalm 119:105
* God rarely allows us to see every step that we need to see in a situation, but reveals the next step to take
* if you wait on the whole plan then you wont do anything supernaturally 
* God knows what is going to happen before it happens 
* Trust is the willingness to move forward without full understanding 
* sometimes we dont know the full meaning and importance of what God has showed us until after the fact

## Plan

* hearing God involves intentionality 
* Mark 1:35
*
