Notes from church service

* use a framework and not a formula
* dependence on the Holy Spirit is non negotiable 
* there are 7 prespectives

## Principle 

* Psalm 119:105
* God rarely allows us to see every step that we need to see in a situation, but reveals the next step to take
* if you wait on the whole plan then you wont do anything supernaturally 
* God knows what is going to happen before it happens 
* Trust is the willingness to move forward without full understanding 
* sometimes we dont know the full meaning and importance of what God has showed us until after the fact

## Plan

* hearing God involves intentionality 
* Mark 1:35
* you have to have a plan; working in desperation 
* plan should include a period (when is your best time to spend with God),
place (where is your best place to be alone wit God),
program (how or your way to spend time with God)
* good plan positions you to hear God, Proverbs 16:9
* its difficult to recognize someone voice that you do not consistently spend time with 
* make plans but be lead by the Spirit
* Sometimes our lives are too busy and too loud
* most have sight, but don't have insight

## Position 

* where the Holy Spirit deposits His revelations and directions to us
* "Listen Up" sermon series; listen to them in Faith Chapel app
* John 7:38
* God doesn't talk to our brains (analytical thinking) or physical ears
* the things of the Spirit will bypass the mind and be spoken directly to the spirit in the body
* a lot of time your brain will contradict what the Spirit says because it doesn't make analytical sense 

## Promises

* John 10:4-5, 27
* God's voice can be heard, discerned, and give directions
* Believers must mix faith with God's promises to receive profit, Hebrews 4:2

## Prophetic

* relating to or having to do with the future
* John 16:13
* God's people are prophetic people
* believers are not limited to now facts, now events, and now resources
* Holy Spirit gives us revelation of the future; sometimes it is a warning or preparation, sometimes it is for you to take authority over something to prevent it from going forward
* components of prophetic insight: revelation (what was heard or seen), interpretation (what is the meaning) , application (what should I do with this)
* a number get a revelation but then come up with their own interpretation and application without talking with the Spirit 
* when the Holy Spirit that gives you the revelation, will also give you the interpretation and application; dont immediately act on what you were given
*
