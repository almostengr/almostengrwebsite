Notes from church service

* use a framework and not a formula
* dependence on the Holy Spirit is non negotiable 
* there are 7 prespectives

## Principle 

* Psalm 119:105
* God rarely allows us to see every step that we need to see in a situation, but reveals the next step to take
* if you wait on the whole plan then you wont do anything supernaturally 
* God knows what is going to happen before it happens 
* Trust is the willingness to move forward without full understanding 
* sometimes we dont know the full meaning and importance of what God has showed us until after the fact

## Plan

* hearing God involves intentionality 
* Mark 1:35
* you have to have a plan; working in desperation 
* plan should include a period (when is your best time to spend with God),
place (where is your best place to be alone wit God),
program (how or your way to spend time with God)
* good plan positions you to hear God, Proverbs 16:9
* its difficult to recognize someone voice that you do not consistently spend time with 
* make plans but be lead by the Spirit
* Sometimes our lives are too busy and too loud
* most have sight, but don't have insight

## Position 

* where the Holy Spirit deposits His revelations and directions to us
* "Listen Up" sermon series; listen to them in Faith Chapel app
* John 7:38
* God doesn't talk to our brains (analytical thinking) or physical ears
* the things of the Spirit will bypass the mind and be spoken directly to the spirit in the body
*
