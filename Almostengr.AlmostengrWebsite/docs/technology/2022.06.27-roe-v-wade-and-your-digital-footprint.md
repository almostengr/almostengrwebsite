Roe v Wade was overturned on Friday. That means that those to want to have an abortion will have to travel to 
states that allow it. That also means that in the states that have partial or full bans on abortion, 
that you need to be well aware of your digital habits going forward. 



## Membership Stores, Rewards Programs, Credit and Debit Card Purchases

I strongly believe that this data will be used as evidence against women in the future. 

## Online Search and Browsing History

What you look at online and where you browse online has been used in previous cases. One example of this, was 
a classmate of mine from college was had his browser search history used as evidence in court when he 
left his child in a car during the summer while he was at work. Some of the search terms that were said 
to have been found were about insurance payouts and how to do without getting caught. 

In that same regard, people doing searches about family planning and where they can go to "alt-ctrl-delete" 
would be used like the information collected from one's purchases. 

When it comes to this, my suggestions to reduce your digital footprint in this area are:

* that you use incognito browsing when doing the searches related to family planning
* use a search engine like DuckDuckGo that does not save your search criteria
* do not bookmark information related to family planning in your browser. Read what you need to read and if 
you need to make notes about what you have read, put them on paper

## Voice Assistants and Your Phone

People have asked directly asked whether the Alexa and Google Home devices were sending the information to the 
government. The dvices in turn would either not respond or say that they did not understand the question. 
The thing is, we know that they are always listening. 

Reason that we know this because in order for it to respond, it has to be always listening. Just like when other 
people are in the same room as you talking to others, you may not be paying attention to them. Then when they 
call your name, you direct your attention to them so that you can provide a response.
