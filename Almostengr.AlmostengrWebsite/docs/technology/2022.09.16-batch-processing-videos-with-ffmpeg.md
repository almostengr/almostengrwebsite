As you may or may not know, I run couple of YouTube channels. One of the channels I post 
<a href="#" target="_blank">dash cam video</a> of trips and bad driving. The other channel I 
post <a href="#" target="_blank">handyman and tech projects</a> that I complete.

One of the most difficult parts of content cretaion is the editing process. Before trying to 
automate things, I would use <a href="https://kdenlive.org" target="_blank">Kdenlive</a> to 
edit, place graphics, and produce my videos. I occasionally still use it now, but far less 
than before I decided to utilize automation.

## Why Automate?

Automation frees your time up to do other things. When it comes to my handyman work, it allows me 
to take on more jobs and thus have more content to produce. It in theory is a neverending 
cycle, and in this case that is a good thing.

Automating the video process also meant making videos follow a consistent pattern. Reason being 
is that the more variations that exist in the videos, the more scenarioes that would have to be 
coded, which means the more complex the automation. Now having complex automations is not always
a bad thing, but for me I was going for simple, repeatable, and consistent. 

## Simple, Repeatable, and Consistent

When you watch some TV shows, the way that they are structured is the same every episode. For example, 
"Wheel of Fortune". The way the show is set up, there are multiple rounds of puzzles to be solved. 
The Final Spin is always done 10 minutes before the show goes off. There's a commerical break between
every other puzzle. Every episode is 30 minutes. The list goes on.

With the <a href="#" target="_blank">dash cam videos</a>, 
what I decided to do was to remove the video 
intro, and go straight into the video. Information about the video, such as distance travelled and 
major routes taken, are displayed as graphics in the lower third of the video.

With the <a href="#" target="_blank">handyman and tech videos</a>, 
I have an opening segment, followed by show video clip, followed by the rest of the video.
The video clips are named in alphabetical order that they should be rendered in. Then when the 
script creates the input file for ffmpeg, it can list them in alphabetical order using the 
```ls``` command.
