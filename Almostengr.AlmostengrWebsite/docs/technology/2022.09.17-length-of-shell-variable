I was building an automation and needed to find the length of the variable. After doing some research, 
I found that you can do that easily with the commands below.

```bash
$ myvar="some string"

$ size=${#myvar}

$ echo "$size"
11
```

First line creates and sets the variable. 

Second line gets the length of the variable and sets it into a variable named "size" 

Third line displays the length of the variable. Once you have the length of the variable set into 
a variable, then the length variable can be used in if conditions, for statements, or anywhere 
else that you can use a variable.
