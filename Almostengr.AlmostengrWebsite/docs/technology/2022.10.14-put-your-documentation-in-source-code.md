As I research various technologies and ways of doing things, one thing that I found is that 
people are putting their project documentation in with their source code. Now the documentation
files are kept separate from the code files, but they are both within the same repository. 
Why would someone do that?

## Easier To Keep Documentation Up To Date

The main driver for this is that everything that you have associated with your application, 
website, or project, is in the same location. 

This means that when the source code gets updated with new features or bug fixes, the  
documentation can be updated at the same time to reflect the code changes instead of having to go 
to a separate system and make the documentation update.

## CI/CD for Documentation

Just like your application can be deployed to production using CI/CD, the documentation
can be done in the same manner. 

## Folder Structure

As I update my existing projects, I have decided to use the below folder structure for my projects. 
Now this structure may vary depending on what the project is for or if there are no files in 
some of the directories, but this is the general idea for doing this. 

* documentation
* source
* tests

### Documentation

I suggest doing documentation in Markdown. There are a number of tools and utilities that can 
process Markdown files into websites or other formats. Also because Markdown utilizes plain 
text files, you can see changes make to the documentation, as new versions of the application 
are released.

### Source

Source (or src) directory contains the source code for your application. If your application is 
divided into multiple projects, then all of those projects would be placed in this directory.

### Tests

All of the tests for the source code go into this directory. Now you can create separate folders
for the different types of tests (e.g., Integration Tests, User Interface Tests).
