As I research various technologies and ways of doing things, one thing that I found is that 
people are putting their project documentation in with their source code. Now the documentation
files are kept separate from the code files, but they are both within the same repository. 
Why would someone do that?

## Easier To Keep Documentation Up To Date

The main driver for this is that everything that you have associated with your application, 
website, or project, is in the same location. 

This means that when the source code gets updated with new features or bug fixes, the source 
code can be updated at the same time to reflect the code changes instead of having to go 
to a separate system and make the documentation update.

The problem with documentation, and why software developers do not like doing it, is because 
it requires them to go to another system to make the necessary updates and often has a 
completely different workflow than doing code updates.
