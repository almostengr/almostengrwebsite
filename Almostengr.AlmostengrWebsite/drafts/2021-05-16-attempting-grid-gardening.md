## The Latest 

Some of the garden has been planted. Will get the remainder of the garden planted in the coming week. 
This year decided that I would break one of the garden beds up into squares 
so that it contained a plant per square. This way, it would be easier to track what is growing in what 
spot. 

In conjunction with the blog, I will be able to track what is where and when maturity date has bene reached
so that the plant can be picked. As I mentioned on the [About page](/about), I decided to use this 
blog to track my progress, success, and failures on the blog instead of keeping a paper journal.

I have several grow beds and have given them each initials based on their location in the yard.
From there, I have given each plant based on the coordinates of their respective beds.

I will come back and update this post as I add more items to the garden during the season.
