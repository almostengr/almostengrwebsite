## Transcript (Unedited)

what's going on good people this
video i'm going to redo the presentation
that i gave to a group of students
about to about how to set up a christmas
light show
i did this light show you know build
everything out within like a month and a
half
so by the normal light show standards
that's pretty aggressive
especially starting from nothing and
then building sequences and wiring
everything
up um but i wanted to cover that so if
you have any students that
are interested in light shows and
animations you can have them watch this
video
let's get into it
this video well um for this presentation
if you want to actually read the notes
or the
slides if you will that came with this
presentation i'll have a link down to
that
in the description below you can also
check out my website the
almostengineer.com which will have a
link
to this presentation on there
to begin with how i built this christmas
light
show it all started it's everything was
centered around the
control box this is a
picture of what the house looked like
this is not every light turned on but
this is majority of the lights
that are that i had up turned on
um for the december 2020 show i had 2130
led lights using 16 channels
and it took about a month and a half to
build
the show so that's the sequences to wire
up the control box to get all the parts
in
everything else and that made
a show of about 15 minutes
so the next part of this was the
hardware
so this is a photo of the control box
the control box uh has a
power coming in it contains all of the
relays that are used in the show
and control it also plays the audio and
controls the audio
and has the output connections so
there is the power here these two black
lines comes in
to this box here so you have one of the
black lines come to this outlet and then
there's another outlet
over here these two black
transformers go to the raspberry pi and
the
fm transmitter so that the music can be
played
from you know what the person that's
driving up
can watch it from their car and uh can
hear the music
in synchronized in sync with the lights
uh the raspberry pi is where all the
intelligence is at for the show
so everything is done from playing the
music controlling the lights
the show schedules so when it starts
when it stops
posting the song information to twitter
all of that is done
from that raspberry pi the raspberry pi
is connected to the internet
via wi-fi uh it's just using my house
wi-fi
to get the to post the song information
and that's also how i'm able to do
administration
of the pi wireless in use
um also you have the relays here so the
pi controls the relays and the relays
essentially turn on and off each of the
christmas lights for the sequencing file
the christmas lights i'm using are just
the standard off-the-shelf
christmas lights that you can get at any
big box store
you know that you would normally put on
like your christmas tree or
anywhere else so here's a closer look of
the
raspberry pi and the fm transmitter so
here are the
gpio connections and each of these wires
go
to a relay board the relay board is
there's actually three relay boards in
this setup
but for the 20 december 2020 show i only
use two
relay boards because each relay board
has eight channels and
as i mentioned before i use 16 channels
for the entire show
so uh 16 divided by 2 gives
well 16 divided by 8 gives you 2 so
that's 2 relay boards
but in future shows i will be using all
24 channels
or at least that's the intent is to use
all 24 channels
so here we have the audio cable it comes
out of the raspberry pi
and into the fm transmitter the
raspberry pi does have a volume control
on the audio as well as the fm
transmitter
so i can make some adjustments to the
volume
level i can't really make many
adjustments to
the bass and trouble unless i take that
music file and put it into
a audio editing software program
*Music*
this fm transmitter does not transmit
far
depending on the vehicle that you're
using
it may stretch from
four or five houses away from
my house so it's not very far and then
you also have to take into
the geography of where your house is if
your house is the top house on a hill
that signal will travel further if your
house is in a valley
then it won't travel as far
and then also you can move the antenna
up so if that antenna sits high
that signal will travel further um
there's a
there's a limitation with uh using these
fm transmitters
because uh you're supposed to if you're
transmitting on a radio frequency
you're supposed to have a license from
the fcc um however
if you're doing a low power transmission
it's like really
they do have low the fcc does have a
classification for low tr
low power uh signals but this is like
really really low power
so you don't need a license for that
all right next we have the solid state
relays these relays have no moving parts
a relay in the simplest of terms
is a switch that is controlled by
something else that is the electronic so
essentially
the raspberry pi sends an electrical
signal
to the relay board and depending on
which
wire that signal is sent to it
corresponds to
a relay and that relay is then switched
on
um as i mentioned this is silent
operation it has no moving parts so it
doesn't make any noise like it literally
just turns on and off and you wouldn't
hear it
and each relay has a
connection to an outlet that's
essentially how the lights are switched
on and off
is that they're controlled they're
controlling the outlets thus controlling
the lights
the software that is used to create the
show
is x lights there are alternatives such
as vixen
and light arama but x lights is pretty
common
and it seemed to be more uh
supported and more versatile than the
other two are
um when you set up your show in x lights
you have
uh we create a sequence and you
basically tell the lights when to turn
on and when to turn off
uh by dragging them on your timeline and
you also you import your music in
so your music file is represented up
here and
you just go through each set of lights
to
turn on and off as you choose now you
have the ability to be able to switch a
group of lights on together
or you can switch a individual light on
by itself
i use a combination of both individual
and
groups of lights to create my show
the software that runs on the raspberry
pi is called the falcon pi player
it is free to use so if you want to set
up your own light show
you can go and download that and install
it onto your raspberry pi
it reads the file that is created in x
lights it's called the sequence file
and that sequence file has the data of
when the light should turn what light
should turn on and when it should turn
on
it also plays the music and you use this
to schedule your
shows so what time is start what time
should it end
as also what time or what song should be
played together so you create a playlist
for that purpose
and this is a considered to be in the
technical terms of when you create in
the light show this is considered to be
a controller item
next part that i have is the updates to
twitter so i created a custom.net core
application that will
interface with the falcon pi player api
and that api has
you can get the status information as
well as the song information
from that api and so what it does is it
checks the
song to see what is currently playing
and once it detects that the song has
changed from the previous check
then it will go and gather that
additional information it will construct
a tweet
and then it will post to twitter that
song information
using the twitter api um there
is a library a.net core library
that call that is called tweet envy that
is used to
interact with twitter and here is a
screenshot
of what that will look like on twitter
so you have the playing and then the
name of the song
and by the artist and in parentheses is
the album
information if it is available and what
time
that that check was performed
um the reason why the time is included
in these tweets
so twitter has a limitation that you
have to have
each tweet is theoretically supposed to
be unique
and you can't post the same tweet twice
so
the way they do that they look at the
text of what's in that
the the text of the tweet and compare it
to
you know other your last tweet as well
as prior tweets
and if they see you tweeting the same
thing over again then it won't allow you
to post it
so by adding the time all the way down
to the seconds it will make that
that tweet more unique and less likely
to be a duplicate of a
of the most recent tweet or a prior
tweet
and then last but not least i have a
video of the light show
on my youtube channel here a link to
that will be down
in the description so you can watch it
so
that pretty much recaps this particular
presentation that i did
for a group of students on how to set up
a christmas light show
if you have any questions about anything
on this
particular presentation feel free to
drop a comment down in the comment
section below
if you have questions about the light
show in general you can also drop a
comment down in the comment section
below
if you have any uh if you want to
learn more about how to set up a light
show be sure to watch
uh this entire series a playlist for
all of these uh christmas light show uh
information
will be created and also linked down in
the description
so please give this video a thumbs up
also be sure to subscribe
uh new videos each week on saturday and
tuesday and until next time peace out
