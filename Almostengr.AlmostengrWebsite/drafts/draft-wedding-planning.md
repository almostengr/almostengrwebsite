## Invite Guests You Actually Talk To, Not Follow Online

In reading "The Budget-Savv Wedding Planner and Organizer" by Jessica Bishop, there were a number of 
suggestions made when it came to planning a wedding. One of which was keep your guest list to people that 
you have had real conversations with in the last two years. Initially I questioned it, but as I listed 
the people that I wanted to invite and then narrowed that list down per this suggestion, it significantly
cuts down the number of people. 

In this day and age, it is easy to remain connected to people through social 
media. Of those people that you are connected to through social media, ask yourself how many of them are
you actually close with and have more than an online connection to. When you answer and visualize this 
question, you'll realize that your circle may not be as big as it seems. 

The problem with this strategy is that people who think that they should be invited, may end up getting 
missed out on. How you deal with these people will vary on a case by case basis.

### Number of Guests

When we set our maximum number of guests, we did not want to have a whole heap of people there, but did want to
have enough headcount to include closest family and friends. From talking with other people that have had 
weddings, about 20 to 40 percent of the people that you invite, will not attend. 
The reason that they do not attend will vary, but just keep this in mind. In our case, some did not attend
because they recently started a new job and did not have vacation time or because of the risk of COVID.

## Pick A Decision; Avoid Analysis Paralysis

What nobody tells you ahead of time is that wedding planning mostly decision making. Here are some of the 
many questions that had to be answered when it came to my wedding: 

* What wedding colors?
* What venue? 
* How many in the wedding party? 
* What's the budget? 
* What centerpieces do you want for the table? 
* What kind of food do you want to have? 
* What song for the first dance?

Some of these questions, you actually need to give some thought. For example, when it came to the food, we 
knew some of the guests were vegan and some do not eat pork. Thus we included vegan options when 
making menu choices and having the meat for reception meal to be centered around chicken. 
However, other questions, I was tempted to go 
with the first answer that came to mind or flipping a coin to answer the question. Why? Because it was easier 
to answer with what you want than to debate on what you want and end up in an analysis paralysis situation.

## We Gotta Pay For That Too?

We set up a budget in the beginning. It seemed to be reasonable budget per articles on the internet. 
As we got about a couple of months before the wedding date, we realized that there were still some things 
that needed to be purchased and that were not accounted for in the budget. Thus the budget was blown. 

I believe that part of this was the cost of a number of items had increased in 2021 because of the 
pandemic and inflation. Thus what we saw online as a reasonable number, ended up being below what everyone 
who provided that service was charging. To offset this, the necessary adjustments were made and the budget 
was revisited and revised several times during the planning process in an effort to make sure that we stayed
on track or at least close as possible to on track. 

## Make A To Do List

Early in the planning process, I set up a Trello board that had all of the tasks that we needed to do. 
Based on the timeline, there was one item per week that had to be done. That way there was no rush to get
things done and being overwhelmed in the process. Problem with this was that we did not follow the Due Dates
that were set on each of the cards. Thus some weeks, multiple items were being worked on at the same time. 

Since Trello allows you flexibility to do what you want with the boards, we had additional columns for 
other purposes. Here is the list of columns that we had on our board: 

* To Do - What needs to be done 
* In Progress - what is actively being done
* On Hold - what has been started but not actively being worked on
* Done - anything that is completed and does not require further action
* Articles and References - keeping track of ideas or suggestions
* Money Spent - track what has been paid by uploading photos of receipts and invoices
* Point of Contact - track the names and contact information for vendors that you have talked with; 
backup in case you lose their business card
* Contracts and Documentation - upload agreements made between you and vendors in case you lose the physical copy
* Gifts Received - track money or wedding gifts sent so you know who to send a thank you card to after the wedding

The bulk of the activity on the board was done within the first 4 columns. Within each card that was in the 
first 4 columns, a due date was assigned to the task. Having due dates on the task is important because 
you do not want to end up in a situation where you tell the caterer that you have 200 people, but when you 
reserve the venue, you find out that it has a max capacity of 150.
