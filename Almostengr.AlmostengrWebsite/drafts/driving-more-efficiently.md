With the conflict going on between Russia and Ukraine (really Russia bullying Ukraine), the 
cost of gas continues to go up. This is similar to how gas went up during the 2008 recession and
housing crisis. During that time, I was in college. Gas got above the $1 USD mark and 
never looked back. In places on the west coast, 
I remember seeing photos of gas being over $5 per gallon. Here are some of the things that I am 
doing or consider doing in an effort to save on gas with my vehicles.

## Use E85

One of the vehicles that I own can run on E85, but designed for regular gasoline. This type 
of vehicle is called Flex Fuel vehicle. There are a number of things that I have noticed with 
driving on E85 and regular gas. 

### Price

The price for E85 is lower than that for Regular gas at every gas station that I have been to. In
some cases, that price is 15 cents cheaper. In other places, it can be up to 50 cents cheaper. 

### Fuel Economy

When using E85, I do notice that the fuel economy is less than when using regular gas. That 
being said, 

## Limiting Left Turns

I had read some time ago that UPS designs their routes so that they have little to no left turns. 
By eliminating or having few left turns, this allows them to get packages delivered 
faster and to save money. Packages are delivered faster because they are not waiting at red 
lights to make left turns or for cross traffic to clear. I can agree with this. At some of the 
intersections in my city, the major roads only allocate 30 seconds maximum for left turns when 
the entire phase for a signal may be 1.5 minutes and entire cycle being 3 minutes.
