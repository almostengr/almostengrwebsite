## Description

Code for one of my websites, [thealmostengineer.com](https://thealmostengineer.com).

In the past, the website was ran on Drupal 7. To get rid of the overhead of
having to keep up with the maintenance of updating the website,
I have since converted it to a static website that is generated with MKDocs.

You may read up on why I swtiched my blog from Drupal to MkDocs in my
[blog post](https://thealmostengineer.com/blog/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/).

To find out the full information about the technology used on my website, you can visit the
