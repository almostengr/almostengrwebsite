# thealmostengineer.com 

This is the code for my personal blog and website,
<a href="http://thealmostengineer.com" target="_blank">thealmostengineer.com</a>.

In the past, the website was ran on the Drupal 7. I have since converted it to 
a static website that is generated with MKDocs. 

If you want to know more about MKDocs, you can visit the MKDocs website at mkdocs.org.
