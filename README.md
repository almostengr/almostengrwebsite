# thealmostengineer.com 

This is the code for my personal blog and website,
[thealmostengineer.com](http://thealmostengineer.com). 

In the past, the website was ran on the Drupal 7. I have since converted it to 
a static website that is generated with MKDocs. 

You may read up on why I swtiched my blog from Drupal to MkDocs in my 
[blog post](http://thealmostengineer.com/technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/).

If you want to know more about MKDocs, you can visit the MKDocs website at mkdocs.org.
