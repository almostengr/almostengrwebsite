This is the code for my personal blog and website,
[thealmostengineer.com](http://thealmostengineer.com). 

In the past, the website was ran on Drupal 7. To get rid of the overhead of 
having to keep up with the maintenance of updating the website, 
I have since converted it to a static website that is generated with MKDocs. 

You may read up on why I swtiched my blog from Drupal to MkDocs in my 
[blog post](http://thealmostengineer.com/technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/).

If you want to know more about MKDocs, you can visit the MKDocs website at 
[mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
