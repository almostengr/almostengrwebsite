      <h1>CiviCRM Cron Job Script with Wordpress</h1>
      
      <p>To make CiviCRM work in Wordpress, you need to have cronjobs scheduled on your system to 
run to certain intervals. Otherwise you have to manually run these task which will increase 
your manual workload. In this video, I show you how to set up this automated process.</p>

<p>AS PART OF THE CONVERSION OF MY WEBSITE
OVER TO WORDPRESS I ALSO INSTALLED CIVI
CRM AND SO SYMPATHY RM REQUIRES A CRON
TASK OR A ROUTINE SCHEDULER THAT KICKS
OFF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE PROCESSES
WHETHER HOURLY OR DAILY AND SO WHAT I
DID WAS I WROTE A SHELL SCRIPT AS WELL
AS DOWNLOADED THE CIVI CRM
COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TOOL THAT WOULD
ALLOW ME TO DO ALL OF THAT SO I'M GOING
TO COVER THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN
THIS VIDEO WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW
ENGINEERS THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT
THIS VIDEO ONCE AGAIN SO HERE WE HAVE
THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I CREATED FOR
RUNNING CIVI CRM CRIME AND SO THE
REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN SUPER
CRM YOU HAVE A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE
PROCESSES THERE PREFER TO AS SCHEDULED
TASKS AND THE SYSTEM
EXCUSE ME SCHEDULED JOBS AND SO I'M
GOING TO ADMINISTER SYSTEM SETTINGS AND
SCHEDULED JOBS WILL BRING YOU TO THIS
PAGE AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS TASKS SUCH
AS CLEANING IT UP TEMPORARY DATA
CHECKING FOR UPDATES CHECKING EMAILS
WHETHER IT'S PROCESSING EMAILS OR
FETCHING EMAILS THAT HAVE BOUNCED FROM
YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SO THEY RUN AT
VARIOUS INTERVALS AND IN ORDER TO
ACCOMPLISH THAT CIVI CRM REQUIRES THAT
YOU SET UP A TASK SCHEDULER OR A CRON
JOB AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I FOUND OUT
THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT THAT COULD BE
DONE USING THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE
TOOL AND SO IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CIVI
CRM WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS CV
DOT FAR FILE OR CAR I'M NOT SURE HOW
IT'S PRONOUNCED I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE
THEY HAVE THE PH IS FAR FAR FAR AWAY AND
SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN
VARIOUS THINGS IN
CIVI CRM AND PERFORM VARIOUS ACTIONS IT
IS SIMILAR TO THE THE WP COMMAND LINE OR
WORDPRESS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE WHERE
YOU HAVE TO RUN IT AND IT GIVES YOU A
NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO IF YOU RUN IT
LIKE I JUST DID HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
TO RUN PHP AND THEN PASS THE FILE NAME
AS A ARGUMENT TO THE PHP CALL BECAUSE IT
IS ACTUALLY A PHP SCRIPT OF SORTS AND SO
YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE YOU
CAN MAKE CALL TO THE APIS YOU CAN CALL
THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YOU CAN DO
VARIOUS THINGS HERE I'M NOT GONNA GO
THROUGH EVERYTHING AND SO ONE THING THAT
YOU CAN DO IS TO RUN THE CRIME PROCESS
AND SO I HAVE THAT POOL OF DUCK AND SO
HERE IS THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I HAVE IF
YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN YOUR CIVI CRM
INSTALLATION YOU CAN GO TO THE
REPOSITORY FOR MY WEBSITE I HAVE A LINK
TO THE POSIT OR E DOWN IN THE
DESCRIPTION BELOW AND YOU CAN MAKE A
COPY OF THIS SCRIPT AND SO BASICALLY
WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHECKS IT STARTS OFF
WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THIS URL
PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I
GOT THE CONCEPT OF HOW TO BUILD THIS
SCRIPT OUT BUT IT STARTS WITH THE
CURRENT DATE AND THE REASON I PUT THE
CURRENT DATE IN HERE IS SO YOU CAN SEE
WHEN IT STARTED AND WHEN THEY END IT
I'LL PROBABLY MAKE SOME MORE ADJUSTMENT
TO THIS BEFORE ACTUALLY ROLLING IT OUT
TO MY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S
CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ARGUMENT ONE
IS NOT EMPTY AND THE REASON BEING IS
BECAUSE ARGUMENT 1 IS GOING TO BE THE
CURRENT DIRECTORY OF WHERE THIS WHERE
YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS AND THE REASON
BEING IS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE
WORDPRESS IS ON THE FILE SYSTEM IN ORDER
FOR IT TO GO FROM THERE DOWN INTO THE
FILE SYSTEM TO THE CIVIC CRM STUFF TO BE
ABLE TO RUN THE NECESSARY COMMANDS THAT
IT HAS TO RUN AND SO WHAT THIS COMMAND
DOES IT JUST PRINTS OUT THE PATH THAT
WAS PASSED IN AS ARGUMENT 1 TO THE
SCRIPT AND THEN YOU CALL THEM PHP AND
THEN THE CB DOT FARM FILE
AND THEN THE NEXT PART IS YOU'RE MAKING
AN API CALL TO DO JOB EXECUTE AND YOU
WANT TO RUN THAT JOB EXECUTION AS USER
CRON CIVI THIS USER WILL DEPEND ON HOW
YOU HAVE YOUR SETUP BUT YOU NEED TO
CREATE A USER ACCOUNT THAT WILL BE USED
TO RUN THE CRON JOBS AND THEN YOU NEED
TO SET THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY TO
THE LOCATION THAT YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL
IS LOCATED ON THE FILESYSTEM AND SO IF
YOU DON'T PASS IN THIS DOLLAR ONE IT
THROWS AN ERROR BASICALLY SAYING YOU
NEED TO RUN IT AND I ACTUALLY NEED TO
UPDATE THE SCRIPT NAME BECAUSE I HAVE
CHANGED IT BUT BASICALLY THE SCRIPT NAME
AND THEN THE FOLDER ROOT WHERE FOLDER
ROOT IS THE TOP LEVEL OF YOUR WORDPRESS
PROJECT AND THEN THAT IS IT AND SO WHAT
YOU DO RUN THIS AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND
RUN IT FOR YOU NOW ALL RIGHT SO GOING TO
DO DOT OR I CAN DO BASH EITHER WAY WORKS
BECAUSE IT IS A BASH SCRIPT AND SO IS
CIVI CRON EXCUSE ME CBC REM UNDERSCORE
CRON DOT S H AND THEN I AM GOING TO DO
THE PATH TO MY WORDPRESS DIRECTORY WHICH
IT IS AND MY HOME AND SO I HIT ENTER AND
YOU GET THIS OUTPUT AFTERWARDS AND SO
AGAIN THIS IS THE START DATE AND TIME
IT'S THE END DATE AND TIME THIS IS THE
PATH LOCATION THAT I PASSED IN AND THIS
SECTION RIGHT HERE IS THE JSON API
RESPONSE THAT CIVI CRM HAS RETURNED
BACK AND IF YOU GET A IS ERROR IS EQUAL
TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN ZERO THAT MEANS
SOMETHING DID NOT GO RIGHT AND YOU'LL
NEED TO CHECK UP BE LOGS USUALLY IF
SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG THERE MAY BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE OUTPUT THAN THESE LINES
THAT IT DID RETURN THE LOG ERROR WILL
SHOW UP IN CBC RM SO YOU COULD JUST LOG
INTO SAVVY CRM AND LOOK IT'S THERE TO
SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE SO THAT
PRETTY MUCH COVERS THAT PART OF THINGS
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS THAT YOU WILL
NEED TO RUN
THIS SHELL SCRIPT BEING A CRONTAB OR
SCHEDULER TASK SO NOW I WILL COVER THAT
PARTICULAR PART SO ON MY SYSTEM I HAVE
CRONTAB SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN
THAT UP AND AS YOU SEE I HAVE THE SECOND
ITEM HERE WHICH RUNS THAT CIVICRM CRON
SCRIPT AND I HAVE IT RUNNING EVERY 15
MINUTES HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE
IT RUN IN 15 MINUTES AT A MINIMUM I
WOULD SUGGEST YOU RUN IT EVERY HOUR
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME HOURLY TASKS IN
THERE THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED AND THAT
ALSO DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME OF
TRAFFIC ON YOUR WEBSITE IF YOU HAVE A
WHOLE LOT OF VOLUME HOUR IS DEFINITELY
RECOMMENDED IF YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
VOLUME YOU COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH
2 OR 3 OR EVEN 12 HOURS FOR THE
FREQUENCY AND SO BASICALLY IT IS THE
SAME COMMAND THAT I RAN SO I AM USING
THE FULL PATH TO THE EXECUTABLES AND THE
REASON BEING IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU START A CRON JOB DEPENDING ON THE
SYSTEM IT STARTS IN THE ROOT OF THE FILE
SYSTEM IT MAY START IN THE HOME OF THE
USER THAT IS RUNNING THAT CRON JOB IT
ALL DEPENDS SO TO BE VERY EXPLICIT USE
THE FULL PATH BECAUSE DEPEND ON WHERE IT
STARTS IT MAY OR MAY NOT LOAD THAT RC
FILE AND THE PATH VARIABLE WHICH WILL
HAVE THE REFERENCE TO /BIN ALREADY
POPULATED SO THAT'S WHY IN THE COMMAND
LINE YOU CAN TYPE BASH AND IT KNOWS BIN
BASH BUT IN CRON
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY LOAD THAT SO YOU
IT'S BEST TO TYPE THE FULL THING SO IT'S
NOT GUESSING AND SO GIVING THE FULL PATH
TO THE SHOW SCRIPT AND THEN I'M GIVING
THE FULL PATH TO THAT DIRECTORY AND THEN
I AM OUTPUTTING ALL OF THE RESULTS FROM
THE COMMAND THAT'S BEING RAN INTO A LOG
FILE THAT IS IN MY HOME DIRECTORY AND
THEN I'M COMBINING ANY ERRORS INTO THE
STANDARD OUT AND ALL THAT GOES INTO THAT
SAME LOG FILE THAT WAY I DON'T HAVE TWO
FILES THAT I HAVE TO CHECK IT'S
EVERYTHING IS IN ONE FILE AND IT'S IN
THE ORDER THAT IT OCCURRED
AND SO I WILL ALSO SHOW YOU THIS LONG
VOWEL SO GO HERE AND DO CATS BECAUSE THE
CONTENTS ARE NOT THAT LONG AND SO HERE
YOU SEE WE HAVE THE SAME THING FROM WHEN
I RAN IT ON THE COMMAND LINE DATE THE
PATH AND THE JSON RESPONSE AND THEN THE
END DATE AND TIME SO THAT WILL WRAP IT
UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO IF YOU NEED
HELP SETTING UP YOUR CRON JOB ON CBC RM

INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER YOU CAN ALSO REACH
