      <h1>Blog</h1>
      
      <p>Below are the thoughts that I have on life and a variety of subjects, including tech, 
home improvement, and more. Being able to write is just as essential as being able 
to speak, because when those audiences cannot listen to you, they have to be able 
to "listen" to your writings.</p>
<p>I will also add, that having a blog, makes it easier to find things, such as checklists, 
notes from a meeting, and more. This can be done by using the search feature. At the same 
time, having a blog, means that things that you want to keep up or recall, you can do so 
without trying to find the piece of paper that you wrote it down on.</p>
