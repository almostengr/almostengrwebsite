# About

## IT (Information Technology) Professional

Kenny's day job is working as an IT professional. He has years of experience in building 
web based applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain 
software for a living, often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. 

By using a blog, you can search for that code snippet and copy and paste it in. In 
addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly 
what they are looking for.

## Gardening

Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After having some seasons of little success and
being able to literately taste the fruits of my labor, Kenny decided to expand his green
thumb skill set. 

Thanks to social media, Kenny found other that some friends and former 
classmates also had an interest in gardening and they were looking for help. After 
attending a class at a local urban farm about gardening, it occurred to him that a blog 
could be used as a journal to track my successes and failures.

Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located
in the southeastern United States. That being said, the recommendations and suggestions
that are made on this blog are for this growing zone and are not guaranteed to work in
other growing zones. However, please do feel free to experiment in your garden and share 
your experiences with others.

## "The Almost Engineer" Explanation

If you have read this far down the page, you probably are wondering how did Kenny come up 
with The Almost Engineer name. Kenny works (and according to some live in) in the 
engineering-related field of Computer Science, has great problem solving skills, and 
enjoys fixing things instead of paying someone else to do it for him. 

However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) 
instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer.
