# About

## Why A Blog?

Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching 
[a presentation](/technology/2010.07.22-every-developer-needs-a-blog) by 
Scott Hanselman that stated every software developer should 
have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded. 

Fast forward to 2018, Kenny attended a gardening workshop that mentioned that every 
[gardener should have a journal](/gardening/2019.02.23-every-gardener-needs-a-journal). 

As a IT professional, a blog allows you to save code snippets and copy and 
paste them in your future projects. In 
addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly 
what they are looking for.

As a gardener, a blog allows you to track trends and historical information about what you have 
done in your garden in previous seasons and years.

## Online Training

Kenny has many 
[tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HCouBLtXD1j1U_17aBqig) 
that cover programming, home improvement, home automation, and more! New videos 
are added all the time, so please be sure to
[subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HCouBLtXD1j1U_17aBqig?sub_confirmation=1) 
to the channel.

## Gardening

Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After a couple of seasons of success and
being able to literately taste the fruits of his labor, Kenny decided to 
expand his green thumb skill set.

Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located
in the southeastern United States. That being said, the recommendations and suggestions
that are made on this blog are for this growing zone and are not guaranteed to work in
other growing zones.

## "The Almost Engineer"

If you have read this far down the page, you probably are wondering how did Kenny come up 
with The Almost Engineer name. Kenny works (and according to some live in) in the 
engineering-related field of Computer Science, has great problem solving skills, and 
enjoys fixing things instead of paying someone else to do it for him. 

However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) 
instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer.
