 With a content management system (CMS), you have the ability to make changes to your website without having to have knowledge of programming.  Drupal is one of the most advanced content management systems (CMS) that exists today.

### The Government Uses It, So It Must Work
 Drupal websites are known to be secure as the code is rigerously tested for flaws before being relased. Many government websites are run on Drupal.  One of the most well known Drupal-based websites is whitehouse.gov (yes, the website of the Presdient of the United States).

 We take time to understand your long term needs and intented use for your website. Then utilizing some of the thousands of Drupal modules, we will create a Drupal website that will suit your needs.  Drupal website options are eCommerce, member-only content, custom web-based software,  or a standalone website.

### Your Website Needs Maintenance Like Your Car
The Internet is continuously evolving with new features and functions.  Sometimes these features and functions are released for use, but it is discovered later that a defect exists.  This results in a patch or hotfix being created (similar to a recall for a car) to address the problem.   If a website code defect remains unaddressed, a hacker can exploit it and use it to destroy or compromise your website, which can cost your business.

Our maintenance packages include:

* Applying feature updates once per month. Feature updates consist of:

Adding, updating, and removing content from your website as you request including links and photos.

Monitoring your website for content posted by or hacking attempts performed by spambots.
* Applying security updates within 3 business days of being released.  Security updates are defined as an update that fixes a code defect which could increase the chance of your website being hacked or compromised.
