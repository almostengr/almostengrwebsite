Sometimes these features and functions are released for use, but it is discovered later that a defect exists.  This results in a patch or hotfix being created (similar to a recall for a car) to address the problem.   If a website code defect remains unaddressed, a hacker can exploit it and use it to destroy or compromise your website, which can cost your business.<br /><br />Our maintenance packages include:<br /><br />* Applying feature updates once per month. Feature updates consist of:<br /><br />Adding, updating, and removing content from your website as you request including links and photos.<br /><br />Monitoring your website for content posted by or hacking attempts performed by spambots.<br />* Applying security updates within 3 business days of being released.  Security updates are defined as an update that fixes a code defect which could increase the chance of your website being hacked or compromised.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2015-06-24 17:06:22**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 23:02:24**<br /><br />
