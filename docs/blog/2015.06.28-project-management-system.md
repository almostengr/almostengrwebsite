"# Project Management System<br /><br />Does your company have many projects?  If so, are the materials needed to complete them and other necessary information located in a centralized location for your staff to be able to access?  If not, then you need a project management system built by Black box Innovation Technologies. <br /><br />Black Box Innovation Technologies has built its own project management system that contains all information related to a project, generates contracts, subcontractors may view project information that he or she is working on, allows clients to view and pay invoices, allows clients to stay up to date with the status of their project, and for clients to submit maintenance tickets.  The components that make up the system are consistently kept up-to-date.<br /><br />If you would like a demonstration for what BBIT can do for you, give us a call at 205-523-4730 or visit our website at http://www.blackboxitech.com<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-06-28 08:49:51** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 20:10:05** <br /><br />
