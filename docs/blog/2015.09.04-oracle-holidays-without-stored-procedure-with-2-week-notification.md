# Oracle Holidays without Stored Procedure with 2 Week Notification

A client had a need for notifying others of upcoming holidays in some automated reports.  Instead of manually adding these holidays to the reports as they were approaching, it was suggested that the dates be added to the report automatically.  Through the use of SQL, the below code was created.  It is not flawless, but does provide advance notification that met the client's needs. 

## MLK Day, 3rd Monday in January
``` sql
select 'Upcoming Holiday and Special Processing: Martin Luther King Day is on ' || 
(select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-JAN-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday'))  from dual where 
sysdate >= (select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-JAN-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday'))-14 from dual) and
sysdate <= (select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-JAN-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday')) from dual);
```

## President's Day, 3rd Monday in February
``` sql
select 'Upcoming Holiday and Special Processing: President''s Day is on ' || 
(select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-FEB-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday')) from dual)  from dual where 
sysdate >= (select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-FEB-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday'))-14 from dual) and
sysdate <= (select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '14-FEB-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday')) from dual);
```

## Daylight Savings Time Start, 2nd Sunday in March

sysdate >= (select to_date(NEXT_DAY(to_date((select '1-MAR-' || to_char(sysdate, 'YY') from dual)),'Monday'))-14 from dual) and
