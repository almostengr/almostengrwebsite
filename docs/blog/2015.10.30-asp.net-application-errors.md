"# ASP.Net Application Errors<br /><br />I've been working with an ASP.Net application. <br /><br />After publishing the application and moving it to the server, initially I would get an error message saying that the application was unable to run and to add some code to the web.config file. <br /><br />The code stated something about enabling CustomErrors.  More information about the CustomErrors tag can be found here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h0hfz6fc.aspx<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-10-30 20:29:58** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-09 00:46:58** <br /><br />
