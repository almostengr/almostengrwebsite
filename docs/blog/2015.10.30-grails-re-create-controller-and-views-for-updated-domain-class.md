echo "# Grails - Re-create Controller and Views for updated Domain class<br /><br />I did some work with Grails (version 1.3.7) and Groovy today. I use SpringSource ToolSuite as my IDE.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you change the variables in the domain class, then you will have to update the controller and views in order for the new fields to be shown/remove. To update the controller and views with new variables in the domain class, you must execute the "generate-all" command to re-create the controller and views with the added/removed variables. <br /><br /><br /><br />In the worse case, delete the controller and views and then re-add them by using the "generate-all" command if using the command prompt or by right clicking on the project > New > Generate Controllers and Views if using the SpringSource ToolSuite.<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-10-30 20:31:55**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 20:10:05**<br /><br />
