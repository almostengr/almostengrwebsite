"# Installing Drupal 7 on 1and1 servers<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You will need a 1and1 hosted package that supports PHP 5.2+ and MySQL 5.xx to run Drupal 7<br /><br />1- Download Drupal 7.xx<br /><br />2- Uncompress Drupal<br /><br />3- Create your site's config folder in the sites/ directory. Just copy the default/ directory and call it mysite.com/, then rename default.settings.php to settings.php inside mysite.com/. This should be the path of your resulting config file:<br />drupal/sites/mysite.com/settings.php<br />duplicated from<br />drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php<br /><br />4- To use PHP5 to parse .php files add this line to the top of your .htaccess file:<br />AddType x-mapp-php5 .php<br /><br />5- To add Clean URL support uncomment this line in your .htaccess file:<br /># RewriteBase /<br /><br />6- FTP the installation files to your 1and1 server in binary mode, use permissions 0755<br /><br />8- Go to your 1and1 control panel and under Domains point your domain to your Drupal installation. In the domain list the Destination column should read:<br />Web space (/drupal) or whatever you named your Drupal installation.<br /><br />9- Go to your 1and1 control panel and under MySQL Administration create a new database for your new site, leave this window open<br /><br />10- Browse to your site URL -- the Drupal installation should guide you through the rest of the process. If you get a 404, you probably did not point it to the correct directory. If you get an error, you probably did not update the .htaccess file.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Source<a href=""http://sitetrick.com/node/21"" style=""background-color: transparent;"">http://sitetrick.com/node/21</a><br /><br />**Posted: 2015-10-30 20:36:04** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 20:10:05** <br /><br />
