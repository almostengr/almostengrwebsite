"# Use session variables in Grails domain class<br /><br />**Engineer Level: College Dropout (Intermediate)** <br /><br />If you have tried using a session variable in the domain class of your Grails project, you clearly know that this will not work.<br /><br /><br /><br />In your domain class, you will need to add the following import statement (this goes at the top of your domain class file, above the class declaration)<br /><br /><br /><br />```import org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder </span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You will also need to include the following to get the session variables from the server (Tomcat)<br /><br /><br /><br />```def session = RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes().getSession() </span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In my instance, I was using the session variable to get a value that was only being used in the session to work with one of my constraints. The session variable did not need to be saved to the database, so I did not create an class member for it. I had to call ```.getSession() </span>from within the custom validator constraint that I created because Grails was trying to use the session variable as part of the domain class.<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-10-30 20:34:40** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-05 12:30:40** <br /><br />
