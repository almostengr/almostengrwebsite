"# Automating Ubuntu 14.04 Automatic Updates<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)** <br /><br />```sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades```<br /><br /><br />If you receive an error stating that unattended-upgrades package cannot be found, then run the command below. Otherwise skip to the next section. <br /><br />```<br />sudo apt-get update<br />sudo apt-get install -y unattended-upgrades<br />```<br /><br /><br />The command above will install (or reinstall) the package and any other required dependencies. <br /><br />To change the time that updates run, you'll need to update the crontab for this job.  Run the command <br />```sudo vi /etc/crontab```<br /><br /><br />Find the line that contains<br />```15 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )```<br /> <br />and change it to <br />```15 2    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )```<br /><br />Then save the crontab file and exit.<br /><br />If you want to view the automatic update history, you can view the Unattended Upgrades log file by going to the log directory ```cd /var/log/unattended-upgrades/```<br />.  Here you will have the log files for the updates that were performed.<br />```<br />root@pbook:/var/log/unattended-upgrades# ls<br />unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-02-23_06:53:08.139255.log  unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-03-02_06:45:32.549847.log  unattended-upgrades.log<br />unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-02-25_06:37:04.235617.log  unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-03-03_06:51:24.794181.log  unattended-upgrades.log.1.gz<br />unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-02-27_06:47:23.014962.log  unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-03-10_06:44:05.855211.log  unattended-upgrades-shutdown.log<br />```<br /><br /><br />Additional options related to the Unattended Upgrades including automatic reboot and sending email notifications can be found in <br />/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades<br /><br />**Posted: 2016-03-10 21:20:48** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-05 11:58:47** <br /><br />
