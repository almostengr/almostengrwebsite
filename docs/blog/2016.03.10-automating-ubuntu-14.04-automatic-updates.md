# Automating Ubuntu 14.04 Automatic Updates

``` bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```


If you receive an error stating that unattended-upgrades package cannot be found, then run the command below. Otherwise skip to the next section. 

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y unattended-upgrades
```


The command above will install (or reinstall) the package and any other required dependencies. 

To change the time that updates run, you'll need to update the crontab for this job.  Run the command 
``` bash
sudo vi /etc/crontab
```


Find the line that contains
``` bash
15 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
```
 
and change it to 
``` bash
15 2    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
```

Then save the crontab file and exit.

If you want to view the automatic update history, you can view the Unattended Upgrades log file by going to the log directory 
``` bash
cd /var/log/unattended-upgrades/
```

Here you will have the log files for the updates that were performed.

``` bash
root@pbook:/var/log/unattended-upgrades# ls
unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-02-23_06:53:08.139255.log  unattended-upgrades-dpkg_2016-03-02_06:45:32.549847.log  unattended-upgrades.log
