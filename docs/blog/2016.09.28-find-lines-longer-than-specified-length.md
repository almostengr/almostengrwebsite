# Find Lines Longer than Specified Length

**Engineer Level: College Dropout (Intermediate)** 

When editing data files, sometimes you need to find the lines that are longer or shorter than a certain length to make corrections.  However when a data files has several hundred thousand or millions of rows, this can be a very time consuming task. The way to accomplish this is to use ""awk"". 

awk is a program that is often used for parsing and processing data into readable chunks.  An example would be reading a CSV file into a script to display a particular output. 

What is the command: 
```
awk 'length($0)>50' datafile.txt
```
 

Breaking down the command we have: 

```
awk
```

This is the program that we are running 

```
'length($0)>50' 
```


This is the argument that is passed to the program.
