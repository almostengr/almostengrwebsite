# FarmOS NWS 2.0

The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service (NWS) to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

We noticed that some small farmers and gardeners do not have the financial resources to deploy many sensors for their FarmOS installation. However, by combining the data provide from the local NWS weather station and using additional Drupal modules, FarmOS can be better automated with a lower investment.
