# Kanban Board in Drupal 7

![example of Kanban board](/images/2018.03.27-kanban board.jpg)

This tutorial shows how to set up a Kanban board using Drupal 7 and contributed modules. No coding is required. 

Kanban is a project management skill that allows you to visually see tasks and the state of those tasks.

The modules required to complete this set up are Fields UI, Views UI, Views, Taxonomy, and a theme with multiple columns (Bartik is used in this video).
