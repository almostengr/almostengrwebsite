"# How to Replace Toilet Gasket and Bolts<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Degree Holding (Advanced)** <br /><br /><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju0myotZnXU"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> <br /><br />In this tutorial, I replace the toilet gasket between the tank and bowl of the toilet. <br /> <br /><br />Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. <br /> <br /><br />The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are utilized during a flush.  It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it was good that it was caught at this point.  Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom. <br /> <br /><br />If you have comments or questions about the video, please leave them on the video's YouTube page.<br /><br />**Posted: 2018-07-21 08:30:02** <br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-05 12:22:25** <br /><br />
