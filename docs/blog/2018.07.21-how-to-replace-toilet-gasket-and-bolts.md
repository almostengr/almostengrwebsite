# How to Replace Toilet Gasket and Bolts

## Summary

In this tutorial, I replace the toilet gasket between the tank and bowl of the toilet. 

Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. 

The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down 
the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are 
utilized during a flush.  It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it 
was good that it was caught at this point. Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have 
led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom.
