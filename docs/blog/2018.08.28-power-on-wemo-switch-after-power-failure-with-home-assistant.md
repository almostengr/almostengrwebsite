echo "# Power On Wemo Switch After Power Failure with Home Assistant<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_ljR0iT3Sg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />This tutorial shows you how to power on a Wemo switch after a power failure. <br /><br />When a power failure occurs, the Wemo switch will default to the Off state. I'm using the Wemo switch to be able to remotely restart the router if I have internet connection issues.  <br /><br />A power failure recently occurred before shooting this video. This resulted in the internet connection being down until I was able to return home and turn on the switch. <br /><br />By having Home Assistant switch on the modem after all connections and power has been restored, I don't have to worry about not being able to access my network remotely after a power failure.<br /><br />If you have comments or questions about the video, please leave them on the video's YouTube page.<br /><br />**Posted: 2018-08-28 10:00:07**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-12 21:02:30**<br /><br />
