# Linux Training Session Notes, March 2020

![Discussion in progress](/images/2020.03.01-linux-training-session-2.jpeg)

## Background Information

As mentioned in the training session, I am providing the output from the terminal from the 
commands that were ran and some detail about the output and commentary for each.

### Input and Output

The commands entered into the terminal look like the following

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ input command
```

and the output from running the command look like the following

```aeoutput
I'm some output
```

### Raw Log File

The entire [unmodified log file](/blog/2020.03.01-linux-training-session.log) is available for download. Some of the inputs, due to 
typos, are difficult to read due to the way that PuTTY generates the log files.

### CSV Data Files 

CSV data files were generated using <a href="https://generatedata.com" target="_blank">generatedata.com</a>.

### Next Training Session

Future training sessions have not been scheduled at this time. If you are interested in attending a future session, 
you can reach out to me via the [contact page](/contact/) to let me know that you are interested.
Once the next session has been scheduled, a notification will be sent out with the details.
In addition, sessions will be listed on this website when they are scheduled.

## Let The Session Begin

![Session in progress](/images/2020.03.01-linux-training-session-3.jpeg)

To ensure that everyone was able to see my screen, I ran the ```top``` command as it periodically
refreshes the data on the screen. Once we had screen sharing going, the training got started.

### Whats Running On The System

The ```top``` command shows the current CPU usage as well as the processes that are currently running, 
memory usage, and system up-time. This is similar to the Task Manager in Windows.

To exit this program, you will need to press the "q" key. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ top
```

```aeoutput

### Showing What Version of Linux is Running and System Information

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ uname -a
```

```aeoutput
Linux linuxtraining 4.15.0-88-generic #88-Ubuntu SMP Tue Feb 11 20:11:34 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

### Printing The Current Directory and Changing Directories

See (print) the current working directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/home/almostengr
```

List the files in the current directory

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

Change to the /var/tmp directory. This command has no output unless directory entered does not exist.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd /var/tmp
```

Confirm that you are in the /var/tmp directory by printing the current directory

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/var/tmp$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/var/tmp
```

Go back to the home directory. This command has no output.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/var/tmp$ cd
```

Confirm that you are in the home directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/home/almostengr
```

### Multiple Ways to Change Directories

This shows that there is more than one way to get to the /var/log directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd ../../var/log
almostengr@linuxtraining:/var/log$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/var/log
```

Go back to the home directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/var/log$ cd
```

Navigate to the /var/log directory again, by entering in a different path.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd /var/log
almostengr@linuxtraining:/var/log$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/var/log
```

### Listing Directory Contents

List the visible files in the current directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

List all (hidden and visible) files in the current directory. Hidden files and
directories start with a period ```.```. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -a
```

```aeoutput
.               .bash_history  .cache     dirtocopy  .profile                   .viminfo
..              .bash_logout   data2.csv  .gnupg     .sudo_as_admin_successful
almostengr.txt  .bashrc        data.csv   kenny.txt  .vim
```

List all of the files in the current directory with their details.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al
```

```aeoutput
total 72
drwxr-xr-x 6 almostengr almostengr 4096 Mar  1 05:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root       root       4096 Feb 23 21:05 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr  790 Feb 24 03:11 almostengr.txt
-rw------- 1 almostengr almostengr 2340 Mar  1 17:32 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 almostengr almostengr  220 Apr  4  2018 .bash_logout

-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6538 Mar  1 05:39 data.csv
drwxrwxr-x 2 almostengr almostengr 4096 Feb 24 03:17 dirtocopy
drwx------ 3 almostengr almostengr 4096 Feb 23 21:05 .gnupg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr  576 Feb 24 03:11 kenny.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 almostengr almostengr  807 Apr  4  2018 .profile
-rw-r--r-- 1 almostengr almostengr    0 Feb 23 21:06 .sudo_as_admin_successful
drwxr-xr-x 2 almostengr almostengr 4096 Mar  1 05:39 .vim
-rw------- 1 almostengr almostengr 6805 Mar  1 05:40 .viminfo
```

One period ```.``` refers to the current directory.
Thus the command below will change the directory to the current directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd .
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/home/almostengr
```

Two periods ```..``` refers to the parent directory. Thus the command 
below will change to the parent directory of the current directory.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd ..
almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ pwd
```

```aeoutput
/home
```

Each user has a home directory. To go back to your home directory, 
you enter the command below in. This command does not return any output.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ cd
```

### Creating New Folder

To create a new folder, you use the command below. You will need to replace 
```anewfolder``` with the name of the folder that you want to create.
This command does not return any output. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ mkdir nanewfolder
```

Once you have ran the command above, you can use the ```ls``` command to confirm 
that the folder has been created.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  anewfolder  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

### Predefined Aliases

On some systems, the directories are highlighted a different color from the files. 
Ubuntu is one of the systems that does this out of the box. The reason is because there 
is an alias defined for the ```ls``` command. I showed what was really running when 
performing the ```ls``` by showing the alias.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias ls
```

```aeoutput
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

### Removing Folders and Files

If you attempt to remove a directory without specifying the recursive option, the system 
will complain that the action cannot be done. The system will not allow you to delete a folder
without deleting the child elements in that folder because that would leave the child 
elements orphaned on the system.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm anewfolder/
```

```aeoutput
rm: cannot remove 'anewfolder/': Is a directory
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  anewfolder  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

The recursive option still must be used even if the directory is empty.
This time the remove command is run with the recursive option and the folder is removed.
The ```rm``` command does not return any output unless there is an error executing the command.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm -r anewfolder/
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

Below are examples of commands that you do not want to run. If you do run any of the commands, they 
will result in the entire file system being deleted. Some of these require that the executing user 
have sudo permissions. The commands in the example below have been commented out so that they 
cannot be intentionally run.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -r /*
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -rf /*
```

The equivalent of the above commands is going to the root ```/``` directory and running the commands 
below. The commands in the example have intentionally been commented out so that they cannot be easily run.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd /
almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ ls
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run
almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f
almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f f *
```

To find all of the options an example of the ```rm``` command, you can enter in the 
the help argument to the command. The help page wil display different output depending 
on the distrubution of Linux that you are using.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ rm --help
```

For more information about the command, you can use the ```man``` page. The output from this 
will vary depending on the Linux distribution that you are using.

```
almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ man rm
```

Autocomplete can be used with the ```rm``` command as well. Just type part of the file name and double press 
the Tab key to have the system type the rest of the file or to present you with files that match the pattern.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm cop
```

```aeoutput
copiedfile.csv     copyofsample2.txt  copyofsample.txt
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm copyofsample*
```

```aeoutput
copyofsample2.txt  copyofsample.txt
```

Below, I show that "sample" as the pattern matched two files. However, "*s*e*" matches three files. Using this wildcard 
pattern can result in you deleting files that you do not want to delete. 
```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls *s*e*
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  copyofsample2.txt  copyofsample.txt
```

If you are not sure what all files will match a pattern, run the pattern of your choice with the ```ls``` command first 
before running the ```rm``` command.

### Recovering Deleted Files 

Recovering delete files on Linux is not an easy task unless you use a disk recovery utility. On Windows-based systems, 
when a file is deleted, it goes to the Recycle Bin. Linux has no concept of the Recycle Bin. There is a way that the 
Recycle Bin concept can be done. 

To set up your makeshift Recycle Bin on Linux, you can create an alias for the ```rm``` command or use a different 
alias that will move the file to a different directory instead of deleting the file. 

```alias rm="mv $@ /var/tmp"```

If you use the command above as an alias, any time that you use the ```rm``` command, it will move the file to the /var/tmp directory 
instead. Periodically, you will need to "empty the trash" by removing the files from the /var/tmp directory.

### Clear The Screen

Clearing the screen will do what it says. The prompt will be moved to the top of the screen. 
On some systems, this will limit whether you can scroll back or not.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ clear
```

### Copying Files

To display the help information for using the file copy, use the ```--help``` option.
The help page will vary based on the Linux distribution that you are using.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp --help
```

This is the list of directory contents before performing a file copy.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  data2.csv  data.csv  dirtocopy  kenny.txt
```

If you do not remember the filename that you want to copy or the filename is long that you do 
not want to type it, then you can use auto-complete to have the system complete the filename 
for you. Start by typing part of the file name in the prompt.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p d
```

Then double press the Tab key and you will get the following. 

```aeoutput
data2.csv  data.csv   dirtocopy/
```

Since there are multiple matches for files that start with "d", the system will not automatically 
guess which one that you are trying to type. Instead it will list all of the files that match the 
criteria that you have defined so that you can pick which one.

The same will happen now that we have typed "data" in the prompt as there are two files that being 
with "data" in this directory. From here we can type an additional character that matches the file 
that we want to use in our command and it will complete the rest of the filename.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data
```

```aeoutput
data2.csv  data.csv
```

"data2.csv" is the file that is being copied to "copiedfile.csv". To confirm that the file has been 
copied, we run the ls command with the file names that were used in the ```cp``` command as arguments
to only show those two files. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data2.csv copiedfile.csv
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al data2.csv copiedfile.csv
```

Since we used the ```-p``` option in our file copy, the original and 
copied file will have the same last modified date and time.

```aeoutput
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 copiedfile.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 data2.csv
```

Going to copy the file that we created to another file. This time without using the preserve option.
Also going to use the wild card with the ```ls``` command to show both files instead of specifying 
each file name. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp sample.txt copysofsample.txt
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al *sample*
```

```aeoutput
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar  1 22:15 copyofsample.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar  1 22:12 sample.txt
```

Since the ```-p``` option was not used when copying the file, the copied file will have the current 
timestamp (22:15).

### Creating Files

To create a file, you can use the ```touch``` command. The file will be created with the name that 
you provide.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ touch sample.txt
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al sample.txt
```

```aeoutput
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar  1 22:12 sample.txt
```

### Viewing File Contents

There are many ways of viewing file contents. To display an entire file on the screen, you use ```cat```. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cat data2.csv
```

A better way of displaying data on the page, is to use the ```more``` command. This will display 
one full screen of information. To navigate using the ```more``` command, you can 

* go the next screen of information by using the space bar
* go forward one line by pressing the Enter key
* go backwards one line by pressing the "B" key
* go back to the command prompt by pressing the "Q" key or continue to end the space bar until you reach the end of the file

The ```more``` command can be used for other operations, including paging the output 
for files and directories. 

We navigated to the /etc directory and listed the contents.

Question was asked if more could only be used on data files. I showed that it could
be used on any text file on the system. I also mentioned that it could be used on image
files, but that the output would not be pretty.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ more libaudit.conf
```

```aeoutput
## This is the configuration file for libaudit tunables.
## It is currently only used for the failure_action tunable.

## failure_action can be: log, ignore, terminate
failure_action = ignore
```

### Viewing Files (From Beginning of File) Using Head

The ```head``` command is used to read from the top of a file. To find out the options 
for this command, you can run the command below.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ head --help
```

By default, head will display the top 10 lines in a file. You can specify the number of 
lines that it should display. In the command below, I have specified that it display 
the top 15 lines of the file.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ head -15 data2.csv
```

```aeoutput
id,first_name,last_name,email,region,country
1,Christian,Walls,non.hendrerit.id@a.net,Manitoba,Spain
2,Mona,Morales,pulvinar.arcu.et@lacusEtiam.ca,Cusco,Mongolia
3,Channing,Ford,ipsum.dolor.sit@id.ca,Metropolitana de Santiago,Faroe Islands
4,Aurora,Lucas,dis.parturient.montes@Proin.net,Waals-Brabant,Montserrat

14,Macon,Stone,varius.ultrices.mauris@ornarelectusjusto.com,JT,Macao
```

If you specify that it display more lines than what are in the file, it will be the 
equivalent of running the ```cat``` command as it will display the entire file. 
The data2.csv file only has 101 lines in it. Since 125 was specified as the number of lines 
to print out, it will display the entire file.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ head -125 data2.csv
```

### Viewing Files (From End of File), Using Tail

```tail``` command works in the same fashion as the ```head``` command excepts it reads from the end 
of the file. By default, it will display the last 10 lines of the file. In the command below, I have
specified that it displays the last 15 lines of the file. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ tail -15 data2.csv
```

### Listing Files By Last Modified and Sort Order

To see the list of options that can be used with the ```ls``` command, you can use the 
help option or man page. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls --help
```

or

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ man ls
```


To list files in order that are sorted by date and time in reverse order, you can use the
command below. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -altr
```

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files 
in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files
at the beginning. 

The command ```ls -alt``` will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at 
the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them.

It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was 
last modified. In most circumstances, this listing will not be useful as it will not have any of the date or 
time information presented. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -1t

### Listing Only Directories

You can list only the directories using the ```ls``` command. You have to use the ```*/```
in the command. This command may vary depending on the Linux distribution that you are using.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -d */
```

```

Another way to list the files with the directories is to run the following command. 
This command will put a trailing slash on each item that is a directory. Files do not have slashes.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -F
```

### Different Way Of Listing Only CSV Files In Directory

You can use the grep command to filter out the list of files 
and directories using the pipe ```|``` character.

In the example below, the output of the ```ls``` command is "piped" to the ```grep```
command and then displayed.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -l | grep csv
```

```aeoutput
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 copiedfile.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 data2.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6538 Mar  1 05:39 data.csv
```

The command above, will return the same command as below.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -l *csv
```

```aeoutput
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 copiedfile.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 data2.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6538 Mar  1 05:39 data.csv
```

### Searching Files and Output with grep

You can use ```grep``` to find certain strings or patterns in a file.  The help documentation 
for the command can be found by running the command below.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep --help
```

Below I have used the command and piped it to ```more``` to show the lines in the file that 
contain "s". 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep s data2.csv | more
```

```

The grep command is case-sensitive. As you can see, the lower case "s" returns a different number 
of rows than the upper case "S" from the same file. 

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep s data2.csv | more wc -l
```

```aeoutput
97
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep S data2.csv | wc -l
```

```aeoutput
46
```

A case-insensitive search can be done by using the ```-i``` option. The below command was run and returned a
all of the lines that contained a "S" whether it was upper or lowercase.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep -i S data2.csv | wc -l
```

```aeoutput
99
```

### Difference Between Pipe and Output

In the examples above, I piped the output from one command to another command. It was asked if ```|``` is the same 
as using ```>>```, to which I answered that it was not. I ran the commands below to demonstrate the differences.

When using the pipe command, the output is passed to the next command after the pipe. In this example, it resulted
in the number of lines being displayed on the screen and no file being created.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al | wc -l
```

```aeoutput
20
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```
```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  copyofsample2.txt  data2.csv  dirtocopy
copiedfile.csv  copyofsample.txt   data.csv   kenny.txt
```

When using the append command, the output is passed to the filename that comes after the double arrowss. in this e
example, it resulted in the output of the ```ls``` command being written to a file named wc.
```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al >> wc -l
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```
```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  copyofsample2.txt  data2.csv  dirtocopy  wc
copiedfile.csv  copyofsample.txt   data.csv   kenny.txt
```

When viewing the contents of the file named "wc", we see a listing of files and directories.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ more wc
```

```aeoutput
total 80

### Look At Previous Commands Ran

To see the previous commands that you have ran, you can run the ```history``` command. To filter 
that list, you can use the ```grep``` command. In this scenario, I was grepping for the grep command. Thus 
why it is listed twice after the pipe.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ history | grep grep
```

```aeoutput
    2  ifconfig | grep 192
  231  ps -ef | grep almostengr
  343  ls -l | grep csv
  345  grep s data2.csv | more
  346  grep s data2.csv | wc -l
  347  grep S data2.csv | wc -l
  348  grep --help
  349  grep s data2.csv | more
  350  grep s data2.csv | wc -l
  352* grep -i S data2.csv
  353  grep -i q data2.csv | wc -l
  361  history | grep grep
```

### Using the wc Command 
```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep -i q data2.csv | wc -l
```

```aeoutput
30
```

I filtered the data file by only including rows that have a "q" in them into another file. 
Then I counted the number of lines in that file using the ```wc``` command.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep -i q data2.csv >> filrowswithq.txt
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ wc rowswithq.txt
```

```aeoutput
  30   49 1999 rowswithq.txt
```


### Using vi 

Those that attended the session got some experience using vi. That output was not easily captured by 
PuTTY log utility, so it was excluded from this blog post.

After creating and adding text to a file in vi, the attendees were shown how to display the contents 
of their file as well as grep the contents of the file they had created.

Below are the commands that were run for this.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cat editingfile.txt
```
```aeoutput
kasdfj;kalsdfjoai5rj;eafk
lkvn;aovn 9042a
the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy
brown dog
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep brown editingfile.txt
```
```aeoutput
the quick brown fox
brown dog
```

```grep``` found two lines in the file that matched the string or pattern provided.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep BROWN editingfile.txt
```

No output was returned from the command above because the pattern did not exist in the file.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep -i BROWN editingfile.txt
```
```aeoutput
the quick brown fox
brown dog
```

```grep``` found two lines in the file that matched the string or pattern provided as the 
ignore case option was used.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm editingfile.txt && ls
```

```aeoutput
almostengr.txt  copyofsample2.txt  data2.csv  dirtocopy  rowswithq.txt
copiedfile.csv  copyofsample.txt   data.csv   kenny.txt  wc
```

### Aliases and Example Usage

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

### Aliases with Debugging Enabled

To turn on debugging, you run the command below. The command will not return any output.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ set -x
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls
```

To confirm that it is on, run any other command (in this case ```ls```) and you will see 
a line that begins with ```+```. The line with "+" comes from the debugger.

```aeoutput
+ ls --color=auto
almostengr.txt  copyofsample2.txt  data2.csv  dirtocopy  rowswithq.txt
copiedfile.csv  copyofsample.txt   data.csv   kenny.txt  wc
```

To turn off debugging, you run the command below. The command will not return any output

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ set +x
```

To see all of the aliases that have been set, type ```alias``` in the prompt.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias
```

```aeoutput
+ alias
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ grep data
```

Double tapping the Tab key after entering the above in the prompt, resulted in the below output.

```aeoutput

The above output is all of the commands that are being run in the background to perform
the auto-complete functionality.


To create an alias, you can run the command below. The command will not return output unless you have debugging enabled.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias power="ls -al | grep csv"
```

To use the alias, enter it on the prompt.

```bash
almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ power
```

```aeoutput
+ grep --color=auto csv
+ ls --color=auto -al
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 copiedfile.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar  1 05:40 data2.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6538 Mar  1 05:39 data.csv
```
