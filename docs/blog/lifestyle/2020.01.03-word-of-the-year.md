# Word of the Year 2020

## Background

A friend was telling me that she had chose a word for the year. Of course I 
asked about why she chose the word that she chose and her response was rather 
motivating that I ought to do the same to set myself on a better trajectory 
for the year. 

I have to be honest thought. I had never heard of a yearly word 
concept. After doing some online research, skipping over the number of articles 
that talked about Merriam-Websters word of 2019 (which was "them"), I found 
out that this has been a 
<a href="https://aliedwards.com/one-little-word-2020" target="_blank">thing since 2006</a>. 
Who knew? 

Some articles suggested picking a word for each quarter of the year. 
Thinking of 4 words for 12 months was a bit more difficult as I struggled to 
decide on one word for the entire 12 months. Eventually I did decide on 
a word. Here is how I went through the process of determining a word for the year.

## Make a List 

I started by making a list of words that I thought would be the most relevant 
for me this year, that highlight things that I did not get quite right last 
year, and something that I knew I could stick to. After some debate, 
and online research, I came up with the following list: 

* dominate
* leadership
* create
* elevate
* relationships 

Each word has a back story in how it made it to the list. 

### Dominate

I started a new job a couple of months ago. One of the major things about this 
job, is that it has required me to learn technology that I have not worked with 
in almost a decade. Given this significant shift, I want to be very great at 
it coming out of the gate. 

I remember watching "Storm Chasers" back in the day
and during some of the episodes, Reed Timmer would say "dominate, dominate, dominate"
over and over again while they were chasing tornadoes. I felt that by him 
saying the word over and over and over again, it reinforced his drive to seek 
out, find storms, and to be able to chase better than most that had been 
in the industry longer than him.

### Leadership 

If you have read any of John Maxwell's books, you know all he talks about is 
being a leader. Being a leader does not mean that you have to be at the top. 
It does mean that you can motivate and obtain followers where you currently 
are. Demonstrating leadership can help you get to the top. 

### Create 

As you may know, I have a 
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HCouBLtXD1j1U_17aBqig?sub_confirmation=1) 
where I show viewers how to do 
projects that they might be considering or how to do something when it comes 
to technology (after all I do work in IT). However, my channel has not been 
as successful as I would like it to be. The reasoning behind this word, was 
to create better and more content than I have in years past. In doing so, I 
would hope that I would increase my subscriber base and following. 

### Elevate 

Seeing the potential in others can make them feel better in their worse time. 
I do believe that we are called to be able to support each other when we 
have the resources to be able to do so. In turn, those that support will get 
support for their efforts.

### Relationships

I had a dating relationship that failed in the previous year over differences
in opinion. Also had some friendships that kicked the can as well. 
Having those relationships end was never the end goal, but here I am. Also, 
I am an introvert. Most introverts do not have large friendship circles 
or networks, mostly because it takes so much energy to maintain 
those circles. However, I do have a desire to engage and 
interact more with others despite my introverted ways.

## My Word for 2020

After much contemplation, I chose "relationships" as my word for 2020. I 
realized that relationships are the key or foundation to each one of the 
other words in my list.

* **dominate** - While it is possible to dominate on your own, it is easier 
to and better do it with a team. One of the main examples of this was Reed
Timmer. He and his team of storm chasers would follow storms for several 
days and weeks on end. Without those relationships, you cannot have a dominate.
* **leadership** - In order to be a leader, you have to have a relationship 
with the people that you are going to lead. 
* **create** - Those that create digital content, do it in part because 
of the relationships that you can build with others online. Without those 
relationships of interacting with people, the content that individuals 
create would be useless.
* **elevate** - Connect with people before you correct people. Being able 
to build others up is a good skill. From my experience, in order to be able 
to improve the lives of others, you have to have a positive relationship 
with those individuals. 

## Conclusion 

Hopefully this article has inspired you to come up with a word for the year 
in effort to better achieve your goals.
