# Use Twitter and Rules for FarmOS Notifications

## Into

This tutorial allows you to use Twitter for notifications.

Using the Rules module, FarmOS can send notifications for temperature alerts, rain alerts, and more! I use this notification method as managing emails can be difficult and time consuming. By using Twitter platform, means that it works with Android and iOS devices without any additional coding or other involvement.

Check out the video below.
