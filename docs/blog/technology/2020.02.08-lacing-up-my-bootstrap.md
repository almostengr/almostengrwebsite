# Lacing Up My Bootstrap

![Code snippet of bootstrap in custom theme](/images/2020.02.08-lacing-up-my-bootstrap.jpg)

## Background

As some of you may know, I started a new job a few months ago. Part of that new job
meant learning a technology stack that was far different than what I was used to. 

This was a oppoortunity that I was looking forward to as it would expand my skillset 
and also give me something to share here with you. 
Some of the languages or frameworks that I have had to learn include ASP.Net Core MVC, 
Telerik, and Bootstrap. 

I was already familiar with it as some of the websites that I maintain use it. 
However, I did not have a deep knowledge of it because the websites I maintain used 
Bootstrap themes that were already built. 

To become more familiar with the framework, I decided to redesign my website 
to use Bootstrap. Think of it as a personal coding bootcamp.

I have outlined my steps to get integrated Bootstrap setup on your website and working.

## 1) Find A Template

My first step was to go to the 
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap website</a> to find 
an example template and to get documentation. From there, you can download the 
source code for the templates that are provided. 

The templates are very basic and they work out of the box. 

## 2) Integrating MkDocs Variables

Integrating the variable names was rather easy. The MkDocs variable names 
and creating your own template steps are available on the 
<a href="http://mkdocs.org" target="_blank">MkDocs website</a>.

There are some variables that are not listed on the website, but are 
used in themes that have been created by other users. What I did was to view 
those themes and take snippets of the code from those themes to use in my theme.

From there, I was able to adapt the snippets to my theme.

When putting in the MkDocs variables, I recommend that you run the MkDocs server. 
When running the server, everytime that you save a file, the page will refresh. 

When you code the variables, if you were to mistype a variable or enter in the wrong 
syntax, you will immediately see it as the page will refresh and show a white screen. 

If you check the log or terminal output, you will see what line that the error 
exists on in the stack trace. It may even mention the exact character that has caused
the problem, as it did in some of my cases.

## 3) Source The Documentation

### Use CDN for Files

The templates come with links to the CSS and JS files to reference a file that 
is on your website. However, I did not want to add more files than necessary
to my code base.

Using a CDN means that the files will load faster on the users' device because 
they are coming from a server that is closest to the user instead of the 
the server that you website is hosted at. 

Bootstrap provides the HTML to include in your page to link to CDN networks for 
CSS and JS files. This means that you do not have to maintain these additional 
files unless you choose to.

There are two different versions of the files that are available. The provided 
HTML includes links to the minified files. Minified files have the whitespace 
and new line characters removed from the file so that the file size will be smaller.

### Class Names

The documentation on the Bootstrap and W3Schools websites were helpful in finding out 
the class names to use. Some of the items, I was not finding what I was looking for 
so I did a internet search that would direct me to a blog post or Stack Overflow 
with the answer.

Since I did not know the class names immediately off the top of my head, for 
some of the items, I would do inline styles with the style attribute. Then 
once I got the element to look the way that I wanted to, I would then find the classes 
that would give the same appearance. 

After understanding what the classes did, I began to remember some of them and 
would have to refer to the documentation less. 

Some of the class names have changed 
from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4. That means some of the posts that I would find on 
Stack Overflow and other websites were "outdated" because they were based on the old 
version. 

Thus when doing searches for recommendations on how to get an element to do something, 
I had to make sure that I included "Bootstrap 4" in my search query.

So if you search and find the answer to your problem, and you use the class names 
that are provided and they do not change the output, then check to see if those 
class names apply for the Bootstrap version that you are using in your project. 

## 4) Font Awesome

Using 
<a href="https://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> is not a requirement
but I wanted some additional flair on my blog. 

Font Awesome has many icons that you can use on your website to enhance it. Some are 
available for free, but others require that you pay for a subscription to gain access.
I opted for the free version. 

Font Awesome also has a CDN. I found the HTML to use listed on the W3Schools website. 

By adding some code like 

```html
<i class="fas fa-search"></i>
```

will place the search icon next to the element that you place it to.

## 5) Additional Style Sheets

There were some attributes that I wanted to override the Bootstrap defaults for. 
So I created my own stylesheet with custom classes to make these adjustments. 

There's nothing wrong with creating additional stylesheets. If you choose 
to have a local copy of the Bootstrap CSS instead of using one from a CDN, 
I would not recommend editing it.

The reason being is that if you upgrade to a later Bootstrap version, you 
will have to copy out your customizations to the new version. It is far easier 
to have those customizations in a different file as it will be less 
maintenance later on.

### Minified File

The custom stylesheet that I created does not have much styling in it. 
I did choose to minify the file. 

Will this have much improvement in page 
load speed? Probably not right now. If the file were to grow, then it may 
have an impact.

## 6) Images

Some of the images that I have on my blog were in high resolution. 

The higher resolution images would extend beyond the div that they were located 
in. That mean the page looked improper. 

The fixes that I ran across was to add a class to each image to make it responive. 
I did not want to do that as the image tag is generated by MkDocs. 

This meant that oversized images would have to be resized so that 
they would not extend outside of the div.

I have separated the full size images from the web-friendly pages and 
then ran a script that would resize the images in bulk.

## 7) Google Custom Search Engine 

I decided to use the Google Search Engine for my site instead of the built in 
search engine with MkDocs. 

One of the main reasons is how the search results are presented in MkDocs and 
that depending on what words you put in, you may or may not get what you
expect in the result set. 

## Conclusion

I have learned a lot about Bootstrap by converting my website to it. This approach 
of doing a custom theme and redesign of my website, did help me learn more of 
Bootstrap. 

I will admit that I do not know how to do everything with Bootstrap, but I do 
know where to look for the answers to the things that I do not know and 
that I am better prepared for my project at work.
