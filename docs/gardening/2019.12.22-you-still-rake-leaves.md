# You Still Rake Leaves?

It is that time of year. Weather has changed for the cooler and you have a bunch of leaves in your 
yard. Are you really going to want to spend time raking them? Probably not. There are various ways 
to handle leaves when the season change. 

## Let Leaves Leave

That's right.  You can leave them in the yard and eventually they will blow into the street, 
decompose, or blow into the neighbors yard on their own. I took this approach one season and all 
was good during the winter time. However, when the weather started getting warmer, the grass 
was not growing. Come to find out, the leaves have smothered the grass during the winter. Thus
resulting the grass dying completely and weeds taking over like they had nothing else to do. 
This is an approach that I would not recommend, especially if you like to have a lush, green 
lawn.
