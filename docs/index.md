# Welcome

## Introduction

Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching presentation that stated that every software developer should have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded. Fast forward to 2018, Kenny attended a gardening workshop that mentioned that every gardener should have a journal. It eventually occurred to him that he could start blogging about his gardening successes and failures and use that as his gardening journal.
You can read more about Kenny on the [About page](/about).
