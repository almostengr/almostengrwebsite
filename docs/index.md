# Welcome

Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching presentation that stated that every software developer should have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded. Fast forward to 2018, Kenny attended a gardening workshop that mentioned that every gardener should have a journal. It eventually occurred to him that he could start blogging about his gardening successes and failures and use that as his gardening journal.

## Blog Technology

Originally, Kenny started blogging on Blogger in 2011.

After several years of a having the blog there, the blog was converted to
Drupal 7. At the time of this switch, Kenny was using Drupal 7 on a number
of websites that Kenny was building and maintaining. So it made sense to use
it for his personal use.

In 2019, Kenny converted the blog again from Drupal 7 over to MKDocs. The reason
for this conversion was because he found myself spending more time performing
maintenance updates than writing content. He outlines this more in his post on
[switching from Drupal to MkDocs](technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs).
