## Why A Blog?

Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching 
[a presentation](/blog/technology/2010.07.22-every-developer-needs-a-blog) by 
Scott Hanselman stated that that stated that every software developer should 
have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded. Fast forward to 2018, Kenny attended a gardening workshop that 
mentioned that every 
[gardener should have a journal](/blog/gardening/2019.02.23-every-gardener-needs-a-journal). 
It eventually occurred to him that he could start blogging about 
his gardening successes and failures and use that as his gardening journal and restart blogging about technology.
