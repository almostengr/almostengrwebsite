# McGill University Personal Finance Essentials

![](/images/2019.12.26-mcgil university.png)

A friend on social media posted about this online financial course that is available for free from McGill University
in Canada. As you can imagine, the course is designed for Canadians, but I found that the concepts, ideas, and
terminology could be applied to individuals in other countries. I was able to complete the course in about 4-5 
hours (I did it all on Christmas Eve). 

The article that was written about the course, gives more insight into what the course is about and who it is 
designed for. Once you complete the course, you will receive a certificate of completion. Feel free to 
<a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2019/12/13/mcgill-university-offers-free-online-financial-literacy-course-for-everybody/" 
target="_blank">read the article</a>. 

Below are my notes from the course. They are not well structured, but I did make an effort to note the key 
points that were mentioned in each section. I have also included my test results from each section in case you want 
to compare your results to mine. For each section, you have to get 80% or greater in order to pass each module.

I would encourage you to take the course for yourself even if you are good with money. I consider myself to be 
good with money, but did not realize until I got to Module 8 that there is a psychological aspect to how well 
or bad you are with money and investing.

## Module 1, Intro 

No notes from this section.

No test for this section.

## Module 2, Debt and Borrowing

### Common Sources of Debt 

* understand what sources of credit are most appropriate 
* terms and conditions for the type of debt

#### Credit Cards

* are easier to obtain
* rewards and benefits
* look at the fees and interest rates
* a card may have a high rate, but the benefits can outweigh the rate

#### Lines of Credit

* operates similar to checking account as it gives debit cards or is connected to checks
* it accrues interest immediately
* usually has lower fees and interest rates than credit cards
* people often usually take out a larger balance for line of credit 
than for credit cards as they have lower rates 

#### Long Term Financing

* usually used for larger costs assets, cars, or houses
* if you don't pay for it in full, then the asset is repossessed

* down payment cant be used from other sources, like line of credit 
* mortgage loan insurance covers the lender in case you default
* a change of the mortgage term will require agreement between the two parties involved
* loans are amortized
* type of interest rate is a consideration. mortgage payments stay the same with fixed 
rates. However variable rates will cause your payment amount to go up.
* time and interest are impacted by the mount of payments made during the repayment period

### Credit Scores

#### Credit Worthiness 

* Credit history is used and based on credit report. Like a report card and how responsible you are 
* includes debt sent to collections, bankruptcy, 
* usually stay on report for 6 years, but may stay on longer 
* positive info, like making on time payments, may stay on longer 
* math formula is used to calculate the score; from 300-900 (in Canada)
* factors include how long you have had credit for, outstanding balances, missed payments, amount of
outstanding debts, if debts have been sent to collections, being close to the credit limit, 
times you've tried to get more credit, record of insolvency or bankruptcy
* good credit gives you preferential interest rates
* check your credit report regularly 

#### Rules for Borrowing 

* live within your means
* always use debt wisely

Passed with 80% score.

## Module 3, Your Money Today and Tomorrow

* Time value of money - the amount of money is wroth more the sooner it is received

### Compounding 

* allows you to earn interest on interest 
* present value and future value
fv = pv * (1 + r)^t

fv = 100 * (1 + 0.04)^2

fv = 108.16

* the higher interest rate or greater number of periods, the higher the future value
* can only compare values at the same point in time
IF they are not at the same point in time, then you have to bring them to the same point in time 

### Discounting

* money traveling backwards in time, it is called Discounting; the reverse of compounding
* pv = fv / (1 + r)^t

pv = 104 / (1 + 0.04)^1

pv = 100

### Everyday Applications

* doing investments in installments will earn more interest than a lump sum
* doing payments in chunks, less interest is charged on the remaining balance

## Module 6, The Art of Investing, Part 2

Doesn't apply to be since I'm in the US, so I didn't take notes on this.

but can go down with economic down turns

* most investors are risk averse 
* there are different levels of risk aversion 
* less risk would be treasury bills, gics 
* higher risk would be stocks 
* there is no true way to assess risk aversion 

#### risk aversion factors 

* investors level of wealth - wealthy investors can take on more risk 
* age - younger investors can afford to take on more risk can recover from bad 
mistakes based on future income and being able to bounce back over time 
* personal situation and liquidity needs
* personality - some worry more than others. some don't worry enough. Thus 
it factors in to how much each person is willing to risk.

related to conservatism bias; the market can be slow to react to the news, thus 
a delay in reaching its true value

the initial announcement; related to the conservatism bias; results in the stock price 
not increasing as good as it should
