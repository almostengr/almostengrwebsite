# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting 

Each year, the church that I attend does a fast and prayer at the beginning of the 
year. This year, I have decided that I would blog about my experience and results 
from fasting. 

My goal is to update this post each day with the updates for that particular day. 

## Day 0

I know what you are thinking... why is he starting to count with 0 instead of 1? 
Computers navtively start their counting of items with 0. However, humans usually 
start with 1, so programmers like myself have to add additional code in so that the 
counting will be acceptable to humans. My goals during this fast are to do the 
following: 

### No Facebook 

Social media is addictive. Main reason that I'm avoiding Facebook is because I login 
to that website more than the other social media accounts that I have. 

### Daily Commits to Github


### No Meat, Little to No Cheese 

I have refrained from eating meat in the past. There were some noticable differences 
such as having a flatter stomach, going to The John more frequently, and being more 
energetic. In addition, I've watched documentaries that state that eating too much 
meat can have a negative impact on your body.

When it comes to cheese, I have noticed that eating a lot of it can change my 
regularity. Since the last fast, I have gotten away from eating it sparingly. Thus 
I want to get back in that habit of not eating it as frequently.

### Journal Daily 

### Daily Prayer 

### Two Day Rule for Exercising 

Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the 
Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between 
doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do 
agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days 
off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two 
Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true 
workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activitiy. 

### Water, Tea, or Natural Juices
