## Home Automation with Home Assistant

Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology. 

Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home. 
I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community.

The configuration for my Home Assistant instance is available at

## FarmOS NWS

The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.

## Raspberry Pi Traffic Light Control

The purpose of this project is to educate children about the STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, by grouping these subjects together, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. 

For example, most children are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate children by explaining the workings of the "black box" of a traffic light. This project targets the "T, E, and M" of "STEM" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions.

Code for this project is downloadable from our GitHub page at
