## Kdenlive to YouTube (2019)

This project was to build an automation that would take video projects that I have created 
with Kdenlive, generate them, and then upload them to YouTube automatically. 

The first phase of this project, which was to render videos from a queue of 
Kdenlive archive files. I have videos on my YouTube channel that discuss some of the 
aspects of the code.

## Raspberry Pi Traffic Light Control (2018)

![Traffic light](/images/portfolio_trafficlight2.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to educate children about the STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, by grouping these subjects together, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. 

For example, most children are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate children by explaining the workings of the "black box" of a traffic light.

This project targets the "T, E, and M" of "STEM" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions.

Code for this project is downloadable from our GitHub page at

## Home Automation with Home Assistant (2017)

Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology. 

Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home. 
I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community.

The configuration for my Home Assistant instance is available at

## FarmOS NWS (2017)

The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.

Black Box Operations is a project management, help desk, and invoicing system all rolled into one. This web application allows BBIT staff and BBIT clients to stay up-to-date with the status of their project and submit maintenance requests for their website(s). The system also emails invoices to clients and allows clients to login to pay their invoices. By having all of the information located in a central location, BBIT is able to produce quality work, in a timely fashion.

## Scrap Code Dump Blog (2010)

This was the first version of by blog hosted on Blogger. In 2015, I moved the blog from Blogger 
to a dedicated site for a business that I was starting. That business idea did not succeed, 
so I decided to take the existing content and make it part of my personal blog. Thus the current 
website, The Almost Engineer, has this content.
