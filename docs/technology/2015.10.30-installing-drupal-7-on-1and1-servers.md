# Installing Drupal 7 on 1and1 servers

You will need a 1and1 hosted package that supports PHP 5.2+ and MySQL 5.xx to run Drupal 7

* Download Drupal 7.xx

* Uncompress Drupal

* Create your site's config folder in the sites/ directory. Just copy the default/ directory and call it mysite.com/, then rename default.settings.php to settings.php inside mysite.com/. This should be the path of your resulting config file:
drupal/sites/mysite.com/settings.php
duplicated from
drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php

* To use PHP5 to parse .php files add this line to the top of your .htaccess file:
AddType x-mapp-php5 .php

* To add Clean URL support uncomment this line in your .htaccess file:
```
# RewriteBase /
```

* FTP the installation files to your 1and1 server in binary mode, use permissions 0755

* Go to your 1and1 control panel and under Domains point your domain to your Drupal installation. In the domain list the Destination column should read:
Web space (/drupal) or whatever you named your Drupal installation.

* Go to your 1and1 control panel and under MySQL Administration create a new database for your new site, leave this window open

* Browse to your site URL -- the Drupal installation should guide you through the rest of the process. If you get a 404, you probably did not point it to the correct directory. If you get an error, you probably did not update the .htaccess file.
