# Install Webmin on Ubuntu 16.04

## Intro

Webmin is a great web-based, system administration tool for Ubuntu-based desktop or servers. Since Webmin is web-based, you don't have to be familiar with the command line in order to make changes to the system. 

The tutorial shows how to install Webmin into your system. This setup does require the use of the command line to install since it is being configured to be updated with apt-get. However once it is installed, no command line interaction is required.
