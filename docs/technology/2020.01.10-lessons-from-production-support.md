# Lesson Learned as Production Support / Help Desk Agent 

## Background 

I worked for 7 years in Production Support role. When I explained the type of owrk 
that I did, I often related it to calling customer service when your internet or 
electricity goes out and you call to report them problem. I was a Level 2 agent for 
5 years and then Level 1.5 agent for 2 years (L1.5 is a role they made up to keep 
providing services for the client). During this time period, I learned a lot as
well as demostrated skills that others had not seen before. 

## Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire

I worked several issues that required to have the client involved in fixing the 
issue or the issue was reported by the client. In some of those situations, when 
the client was asked of when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would 
say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it was like 
3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself wanted to stay at 
work later than necessary. 

In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it 
really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline 
was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that 
was next to a dry wooded wilderness. 

**LESSON** Ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the 
right questions, there is a change that, you will 
have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will
usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want,
 or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening.

## How to Document

## How to Automate 

## Share What You Know 

There is a common notion that if you share what you know, then somebody else can 
do what you know how to do and then you will be out of a job. While in some 
industries, that may be true, from my experience it is false. My experience has
been that if you know, that allows others to do what you do and allows you to 
do more and new things. 

When I worked on tickets that came in, I was sure to include SQL queries, 
SSH session logs, application logs, and any other information that I used to 
resolve an issue. Why? Because the last thing I want to have happen, is to get 
called for an issue when I am on vacation or
