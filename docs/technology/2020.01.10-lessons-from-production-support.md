# Lesson Learned as Production Support / Help Desk Agent 

## Background 

I worked for 7 years in Production Support role. When I explained the type of owrk 
that I did, I often related it to calling customer service when your internet or 
electricity goes out and you call to report them problem. I was a Level 2 agent for 
5 years and then Level 1.5 agent for 2 years (L1.5 is a role they made up to keep 
providing services for the client). During this time period, I learned a lot as
well as demostrated skills that others had not seen before. 

## Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire

I worked several issues that required to have the client involved in fixing the 
issue or the issue was reported by the client. In some of those situations, when 
the client was asked of when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would 
say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it was like 
3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself wanted to stay at 
work later than necessary. 

In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it 
really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline 
was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that 
was next to a dry wooded wilderness. 

**LESSON** Ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the 
right questions, there is a change that, you will 
have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will
usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want,
 or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening.

## How to Document

If something happens more than 3-5 times, you need to document it. Given that 
I worked as Level 2 support, I would write documentation for the Level 1 support 
team to address recurring issues that were simple and straightforward to fix. 

In the worse case, if the Level 1 Support made a mistake, someone else on the 
Level 2 team could double check the work that the Level 1 had done and 
reassign it back to them if it was done incorrectly. Those incorrect reassignments got 
more attention because of the fact that it reduced the resolution rate for 
the Level 1 team. 

### Example

Ticket is submitted because a file system is close to filling up. Level 1 
support searches for documentation on how to resolve the ticket. They find 
said documentation that you wrote and follow the steps listed correctly. 
Level 1 Support is able to resolve the ticket. No involvement from Level 
2 Support is required.

## How to Automate 

## Jump the Firewall

In some companies, the technology used is so specific to that organization, that 
there are no online resources available that can help you resolve issues. Also, 
some companies frown upon using outside resources to fixing internal issues. 

In my role, it was not necessarily frowned upon. However, it was expected that 
if you did not know something, that you escalate to the next level of support to 
get the issue resolved. Only problem with that is, that sometimes the next level 
of support or developers had never seen the error messages or encountered the
issues that we faced before. So it was like the blind leading the blind on a wild 
goose chase in a corn maze. 

### Example

One of my teammates received an issue for his application. The database
had thrown an error that nobody had seen before, not even the upper level 
support or developers. The database for this application was that of Oracle. As 
you may know, when Oracle databases encounter an error, it usually returns an 
error code with that error that starts with "ORA" followed by some digits. 

I asked my teammate for the error code that he had and dropped on the internet. 
After reading a few forums, messages, and an Oracle branded website, found out 
that the error code meant that the data was to big for the column that it was 
being inserted into. 

I told my teammate of my findings. He compared the data that was being inserted 
to the attributes of that column in the database. Sure enough, the data was like 
1 or 2 more characters than the column would allow. With that information, the
conversation when from what to fix, to how to fix it. That took 5-10 minutes 
worth of research. I had or nobody else thought to look the error up online, 
the issue would have taken way longer to resolve.

## Share What You Know 

There is a common notion that if you share what you know, then somebody else can 
do what you know how to do and then you will be out of a job. While in some 
industries, that may be true, from my experience it is false. My experience has
been that if you know, that allows others to do what you do and allows you to 
do more and new things. 

When I worked on tickets that came in, I was sure to include SQL queries, 
SSH session logs, application logs, and any other information that I used to 
resolve an issue. Why? Because the last thing I want to have happen, is to get 
called for an issue when I am on vacation or to have the on-call person call me 
to resolve an issue that's simple as restarting a process. 

### Example

The person on-call received a ticket for the application that I was the primary 
support contact for. He looks at the previous tickets, to see if it is a simple 
fix or whether he will have to call me after hours (or worse while I am on 
vacation) to attempt resolve the issue. 

In some situations, the on-call person was able to resolve the current occurrence
of an issue, based on the notes and documentation provided on the previous 
occurrence of an isuse that had my notes and other information attached.
Sometimes, even if I did get called, I was able to describe what was done in the 
previous occurrence. Since they were able to see exactly what I did in the 
previous occurrence, they were able to duplicate those steps with the necssary 
adjustments for the current occurence without me having to log on to the computer.
