# Developer Uses Page

![My Uses Entry on uses.tech](/images/2020.02.01-uses-entry.jpg)

## Background 

Recently, I was browsing [Github](https://github.coma/almostengr) to see how others 
had done their blogs and personal websites to brand themselves. In the process, 
I came across one user that had a "uses" page on his website. 

On this page, he stated that he was inspired by Wes Bos to create a uses page. 
<a href="https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses" target="_blank">Wes Bos</a> 
created a website called 
<a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank">uses.tech</a> that is a collection
of the users that have submitted their uses page to his repository.

## What Is A Uses Page? 

A uses page includes the things that a developer or other individual uses to 
do what they do best. For software developers, it may include the type of computer 
that they have, the IDE or text editor that they use, and the languages 
that they program with.

## How Do I Format My Uses Page? 

However you chose! When looking at other uses pages, I saw that some categorized their 
page based on the type of tools. Others categorized their set up in different 
ways. There is no particular way that it must be done other than the fact
that you need to include the tools that you use.

You can look at the uses pages that have already been submitted on the 
<a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank">uses.tech</a> website for inspiration.

## What Is On My Uses Page?

On mine, I have included the software, computer hardware, and 
development environment details for my particular setup. You can check out my 
[uses page](/uses) to see what my current set up includes.

## How Will Others Find My Uses Page? 

First you will need to create your uses page. Then, you will need to add it 
and other details about yourself to the
<a href="https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses" target="_blank">awesome-uses</a>
repository. Once your pull request has passed all of the checks and 
is approved, your uses page will be listed on 
<a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank">uses.tech</a>
website and in the README of the awesome-uses repository.
