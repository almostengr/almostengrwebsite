# Uses

![My uses page entry on uses.tech](/images/2020.02.01-uses-entry.jpg)

## Background

Browsing around on GitHub, I found that developers create "uses" (or /uses) pages that 
detail the tools that they use do their work. Here is my list of software, 
hardware, and other tools that I use to get the job done. 

For more detail about how what is a Uses page and how you can create your own, 
you can check out [my blog post](/technology/2020.02.01-developer-uses-page).
