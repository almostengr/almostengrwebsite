when you have a desk job for a living, sometimes you get tired of 
sitting down all of the time. I know that I do.

## 1) Walk or Exercise

It is recommended that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity 
per week, or approximately 30 minutes 5 days per week. Those that workout 
more or physical trainers may state a higher number. 



I normally go for a walk during my lunch break at work, if I bring a lunch. 
I take about a 20-30 minute walk each time, which equates to about 1 to 1.5 
miles. You may not think that is a lot, but do keep in mind that the area
I am walking in does have hills.

On days that the weather does not permit (e.g. raining) or is not 
ideal (e.g. too hot or cold) for walking outside, I have found that 
other coworkers walk on a particular floor in the building. This 
particular floor is set up in a way that allows you to do laps around it. 

At the time I am writing this article, I have not done laps around this 
floor in the building, but I will one day.

## 2) Water Intake 

When I am working on the computer, majority of the time I am consuming 
water. Occasionally I may drink something different like tea or juice, 
but the preferred choice is water. 

## 3) Watch What You Eat 

No I do not mean that you watch the food as you put it in your mouth.
