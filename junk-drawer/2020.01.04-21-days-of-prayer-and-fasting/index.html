      <p><img alt="Post about using social media more intently" src="/images/2020.01.04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Each year, the church that I attend does a fast and prayer at the beginning of the
year. For the past two years, I have given up something during the fasting season
and kept track of it on my Trello board.</p>
<p>This year, I have decided that I would blog about my experience and results
from fasting. My goal is to update this post each day with the updates
for that particular day.</p>
<p>Why 21 days? It has been said that if you commit to doing or not doing something
for 21 days in a row, that it will become a habit and you will be more inclined
to continue doing or not doing it beyond the 21 days. I did a fast
<a href="/junk-drawer/2019.08.15-21-days-for-a-new-habit">last year for 21 days</a> and some
of those habits have stuck.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>I will be posting my daily updates here so that you can follow along in my
progress. Perhaps you have your own fast that you want to consider doing for the
start of the year.</p>
<h2 id="day-0-january-4">Day 0 - January 4</h2>
<p>I know what you are thinking... why is he starting to count with 0 instead of 1?
Computers start their counting of items with 0. However, humans usually
start with 1, so programmers like myself have to add additional code in so that the
counting will be acceptable to humans. Consider this day to be the day of
preparation before entering the fast.</p>
<p>My goals during this fast are to do the following:</p>
<h3 id="no-facebook">No Facebook</h3>
<p>Social media is addictive. Main reason that I am avoiding Facebook is because I login
to that website more than the other social media accounts that I have. I did see
a post that said to not use social media less but to use it more intently. That post
is the header graphic of this post. I do plan on
doing this more after the fast is over. For the fast though, I have found that when
I cut out the most addictive social media habits, that I am able to do more of the
things that I previously have put off to the side.</p>
<h3 id="daily-commits-to-github">Daily Commits to Github</h3>
<p>As part of my personal branding strategy, I want to actually demonstrate that I do
participate in the IT community and provide digital contributions. That said, I
plan on contributing to making at least one commit to any of my repositories per day
during the fast. I know it seems excessive, but hear (or read) me out on this.
Not all of my commits will be code related. The version control for my blog is
on Github, so some of those commits will be new or updated content for my website. Other
commits will be new or updated code that I have done.</p>
<h3 id="no-meat-little-to-no-cheese">No Meat, Little to No Cheese</h3>
<p>I have refrained from eating meat in the past. There were some noticable differences
such as having a flatter stomach, going to The John more frequently, and being more
energetic. In addition, I have watched documentaries that state that eating too much
meat can have a negative impact on your body.</p>
<p>When it comes to cheese, I have noticed that eating a lot of it can change my
regularity. Since the last fast, I have gotten away from eating it sparingly. Thus
I want to get back in that habit of not eating it as frequently.</p>
<h3 id="journal-daily">Journal Daily</h3>
<p>I have discovered in recent months that there is something about writing your
thoughts and ideas out. Yes, there is the scripture in Habakkuk about writing the
vision and making it plan. I also think that journaling allows us to clear our
heads from the things that we want to remember, but do not necessarily need to
always keep readily on our minds. In other words, it allows you to "clean out
the attic".</p>
<p>I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive
the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality
it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM
periodically, then you will run into problems. <em>On Linux systems, if you fill up
the temporary storage, the OS might crash.</em></p>
<h3 id="two-day-rule-for-exercising">Two Day Rule for Exercising</h3>
<p>Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the
Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between
doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do
agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days
off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two
Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true
workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activity.</p>
<h3 id="water-tea-or-natural-juices">Water, Tea, or Natural Juices</h3>
<p>As I have gotten older, I rarely drink sodas. During this fasting season, I am
going to make an effort to not drink anything that may contain High Fructose
Corn Syrup (HFCS) as a lot of products contain this substance. They say that HFCS
is fine to consume in moderation. Only problem that I have is... 1) What is
"moderation"? Is it once per week, once per quarter, once per year? 2) It is hard
to have something in moderation, when it is contained in majority of the food
and drink that we consume.</p>
<h3 id="daily-prayer">Daily Prayer</h3>
<p>As if this was obvious enough... heck it is in the title of the post.</p>
<h2 id="day-1-january-5">Day 1 - January 5</h2>
<p>Today I had no meat. Went to Chipotle for lunch and an Indian restaurant for
dinner. I only had water and tea to drink today. I spent the morning of today
serving at church, so had to get up slightly earlier than normal. However, I was
able to take a nap after the church services.</p>
<p>I interacted with others about this and my previous post regarding
<a href="/junk-drawer/2020.01.03-word-of-the-year.md">my word of the year</a>. It was very enlightening
to hear about others' doing the same thing as myself, but for their personal
benefit and mental health.</p>
<p>I did not get around to exercising. Definitely is a must for tomorrow though. I
did refrain from Facebook. I made a post yesterday on IG and Twitter, so I
responded to messages and comments regarding those. I did find myself mindlessly
scrolling, which I am trying to get out of the habit of. Once I realized that
I was doing it, I redirected my focus to being more productive.</p>
<h2 id="day-2-january-6">Day 2 - January 6</h2>
<p>Only had one real meal today and that was lunch. Had the remaining Chipotle
from yesterday with some chips, Nutty Buddy bar, and a muffin. As I write this at
8 PM, I don't feel hungry, although I could eat.</p>
<p>Was up earlier than normal today. I took that time to write in the journal and
to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals
instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their
definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail
with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down
into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not
been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the
new ones that I have set for this year.</p>
<p>I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already
had to modify them as they call for meat. Photos will be posted in the days to
come an whether I would make them again or if I need to donate that cookbook
to the local library.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-january-7">Day 3 - January 7</h2>
<p>Was able to get a walk around the block in today. Could have walked an additional
block as I did not do a walk yesterday. Made lemonade from scratch for the first
time. It definitely has the lemon kick in it. Will need to use less lemons next
time.</p>
<p>Watched a sermon that was sent to me titled "Looking Back, Keep Sitting, or
Moving Forward". It was a good message as it talked about how that we all have
a past. However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past
as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given
was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what
is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6.</p>
<p>I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These
videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing
a system that works for you. I feel that these practices that I am learning
can be applied to the work that I do.</p>
<h2 id="day-4-january-8">Day 4 - January 8</h2>
<p>I actually managed to sleep a full night last night. Not sure why that was the
case. It could possibly be because of the lack of meat in my diet, thus
changing my body chemistry. Who knows?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I have been able to keep up with daily commits to this post and
to Github as I have set out to do. I updated one of the sites that I had not
updated in over a year. It had a number of security patches that needed to go
in. In addition, the automated deployment script that I had created, was not
working because of the execute permissions not being set (doggone Linux).</p>
<p>Walking during lunch breaks is a good thing as it allows me to get in the
recommended 10K steps per day. However, I do need some shoes that are intended
for walking such distances during lunch break, as the dress shoes that I normally
wear are clearly not cut out for that job.</p>
<h2 id="day-5-january-9">Day 5 - January 9</h2>
<p>I listened to a sermon that talked about letting the past be the past, and
to focus on what is to come in the future. I have been listening to more sermons
recently, and this seems to be a common theme among them. These sermons
were all delivered around the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Watched some videos today, that had me thinking about some side income ideas
that I could use to advance and extend my skillset in the IT field. I have
watched several videos about people that are using Fiverr to make income. I used
Fiverr back in 2011, but had not really be active on the platform recently. I
figured that I could use platforms like these, to build automations to make
the turnaround time for some of the requests faster thus reducing the
manual amount of work required on my part.</p>
<h2 id="day-11-january-16">Day 11 - January 16</h2>
<p>I have been sick the last few days. Managed to catch the flu. I am still in the
recovery phase as I write this. This is part of the reason why there is a gap
of about a week between updates.</p>
<p>During this time, I have managed to go outside during the daytime, weather
permitting, and capture some sunlight. Being in the house all day quarantining
yourself because of doctor's orders is no fun, but it is a necessary precaution.</p>
<p>Not sure who found out that sunlight
helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like
boost of energy. Not quite like the boost that Popeye gets after eating a can
of Spinach, but more like never riding a bike before and once you get on the bike
realizing the purpose of the training wheels.</p>
<p>I have been told many of times how my post about
<a href="/junk-drawer/2019.07.03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food">squirrels taught me about women and food</a>
is insanely funny. I did not realize that it would catch on in the way that it
did, but I am glad that I can share my story with others and they get something
out of it.</p>
<p>I have gotten through almost entire week of ASP.Net Core MVC training. What
that means is that I can build enterprise grade applications that will run a
multiple platforms. This is definitely a useful skill that I am glad that I
am able to add to my toolbelt.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I have only missed 2 out of 11 days thus far, making a commit
to any of my repositories on Github. Having a blog that is versioned on Github
has helped with this cause. Also having requests for me to share knowledge about
Python and Linux have added to the commits. Those of you that have requested such
info, thanks!</p>
<h2 id="day-12-january-17">Day 12 - January 17</h2>
<p>Completed training for ASP.Net Core MVC. The training is related to projects that
I will be working on in the future. It was good to get training and some
exposure to the subject prior to actually having to work with it. I did
practice some courses and performing tutorials that I was able to find on
YouTube and PluralSight courses.</p>
<h2 id="day-19-january-23">Day 19 - January 23</h2>
<p>The fast is almost over. Did have a moment today where the lunch option provided
had meat, but I did remove it from the sandwich was provided.</p>
<p>Coworker informed me of a challenge that he has chosen to take up for this year. He
said that hi grandson was doing 20 pushups in the morning and 20 in the evening
for the year of 2020. Figured that I would give this a shot as well just to see
what gains or other benefits that I can get from it. Will post about it
sometime in the future.</p>
<h2 id="day-21-january-25">Day 21 - January 25</h2>
<p>Finally have reached the end of the fast. What's next you ask? Well some habits
I will try to keep in place. Others I will slowly reintroduce, but do my best
to maintain what I have accomplished during the fast.</p>
