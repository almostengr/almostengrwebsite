<p>what is going on fellow engineers
this here is part of my hallway uh as
you see here i have the
doorbell box up here and you know i have
white trim
as you see over here on the right hand
side and down here at the baseboards and
the door
but this doorbell box has this ugly
tarnished yellow color so this video i'm
going to show you how to
paint this box to make it blend in with
the rest of
the environment
<em>Music</em>
so welcome to the channel if this is
your first time checking out videos here
just know i do videos every week one on
tuesday
for technology and videos on saturday
for diy
and handyman projects so if either of
those topics interest you
please be sure to subscribe by clicking
the subscribe button down below
so this is my doorbell box um you know
pretty basic uh my house was built in
the
late 70s so you know this has probably
been up here since the house was
built and i don't like this
tan off-white color especially you know
since i'm trying to
like modernize things so the box just
comes off fairly easy
like literally you just pull it off it
has these locking tabs in here
like right there and right there that
connect here
and here and then there's two on the top
there
and so that's it so the next part is to
go ahead and get this painted the next
step
is to get a some sandpaper
or i have this on a sanding block and as
you see it doesn't quite fit
but that's what it is so sandpaper and
what you want to do is rough up the
surface
if you don't have sandpaper you can also
use
some steel wool or copper wool it may
take a little bit more effort to
get this to work like sandpaper but it
can still do the job
and basic the concept that you want to
go for is to scratch up the surface
because when you go to paint this
plastic surface
you want the paint to stick to it
therefore use sandpaper steel wool
copper wool something abrasive that'll
scratch up the surface
all you're trying to do is to rough up
the surface so that it's not
shiny you know normally plastic has a
shine to it
so you want to try to remove that shine
and that will allow
the paint to stick and i'm only going to
do the outside of the box
because nobody's going to see the inside
of the box unless they take the box off
the wall
once you have sanded the surface
sufficiently
just wipe off that excess dust i
am using a tack cloth
but if you don't have one of those you
know if
you know something similar paper towel
with like alcohol on it or something of
that nature
can also do the same job
then you want to get as you want to get
all the dust off of here
otherwise that dust will inhibit the
paint from sticking to the surface all
right
now that that is done next step is to
paint
i just have white paint so that it can
match the rest of the
trim this paint has a
paint and primer and it's designed for
indoor and outdoors
but obviously i'm using the indoor so it
doesn't matter you don't necessarily
need to have
indoor and outdoor paint this
just so happens to be able to do both
um and depending on your box you may not
even need
the paint and primer you probably just
need the paint but because
paint and primer wasn't that much more
expensive than just paint i got
the paint and primer
as always shake your spray paint can up
before you use it
and shake it while you're using it
that's what the instructions say
so just follow the instructions when it
comes to applying this paint nothing
special to it
depending on the color change that
you're trying to do
like you're trying to go from like a
black to a white you may have to do
more than one or two coats to get that
black to actually
be white this should not be take too
many more
coats maybe two probably three
and that's it so
like i said check your paint and start
applying it
and make sure you're doing this i'm in
my garage with the door open
but you can also do this outside you
don't want to do this
indoors entirely because the fumes from
the paint
are they can
cause you know you to become
light-headed and all the other things
so again open area outside or in a open
garage
and when you're spraying walk around and
spray
all of the angles don't try to do this
or anything of that nature
and the reason i say don't do it that
way is because
sometimes you'll spray but because you
can't see what you're spraying you will
miss
part or of what you're trying to spray
so just walk around it
now even with this one coat on here as
you can tell it's already made a
difference
in the appearance of it what i'm gonna
do is let this dry
according to the instructions on the can
and then
put another coat on top of here uh
the kind of because i can see a little
bit of the tan
in here um that was originally part of
the you know that's part of the original
surface
so i'm put another coat on top of that
and then
we'll go back and reinstall it and let
you see the final product
the doorbell box has now been
reinstalled as you see
it is white like some of the other items
on the wall here
and in my opinion i think it was better
painted white than it did with that
off-white tan looking color so
if you think it looks better now than it
did before drop a comment down
below share your feedback on this
particular project
that will wrap things up for this video
if you have any questions
about anything that i've done in this
video feel free to drop a comment down
in the comment section below
if this video has been helpful please
give it a thumbs up
and until next time peace out
