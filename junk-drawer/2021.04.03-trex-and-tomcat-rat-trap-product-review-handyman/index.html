<p>for people like me that like to do their
own stuff
you know handiwork and love diy
this is one diy project that i wouldn't
recommend
for a lot of people
this yes that's right that is a
rat it's been going in and out of my
attic for probably the last
week and i set up a trap about a year
and a half to maybe two years ago
and the trap was still set and
well let's just say said rat succumbed
to
its injuries um and as you can see it
stuck his head in there and
that head got gone like the wind
[Music]
what's going on fellow engineers thank
you for checking out this video
if this is your first time to the
channel please be sure to
consider to subscribe into the channel
each week i have videos
that talk about how to do technology
or how to do diy projects so if you have
any interest in that please be sure to
subscribe this video
as you saw in the opener i'm going to
talk about the
trex rat trap i actually have two traps
so the one in this picture that i'm
going to show
is actually the tracks tricks rat trap
and then the one that i actually have
here is the
tomcat rat snap trap they are both
similar in nature
because they both have are plastic and
they have these teeth on
so anything that gets caught in there is
not going
because the teeth as you see they
interlock
kind of like the teeth of an alligator
so anything that gets in there like i
said it gets caught
so the particular rat that
was in the attic it had been going in
and out for about a week or two
in the attic i do know that there are
some
opening holes and whatnot in the
roof line and in some places in the
fascia
the previous homeowners they
at one point while they lived here there
were squirrels in the attic
and there is plenty of evidence of
squirrels being in the attic
so it's kind of not surprising that a
rat has managed to be able to get in the
attic as well
and so what i was able to do i set this
trap
in the attic like i said about a year
two years prior to this taking place
and the trap was actually still set and
thus
caught the rat i don't remember if i
actually put
bait in the trap or not um i'm thinking
i probably did
and that may have attracted it to it uh
but yeah i'm kind of surprised myself
that i was able to get
this done you know in this way so to
talk about this trap a little bit more
like i mentioned it does have teeth on
it this trap is made out of
entire plastic like the whole
construction with the exception of the
spring
that you may be able to see inside of
there uh
it's entirely plastic this spring and
the
retaining pin are the only parts on here
that are metal
so in terms of durability it it's pretty
high up
you can set it with one hand and
the design of it allows you to set it
and you don't end up snapping your
fingers
trying to set it you know most of those
wood traps
with the metal bar on them you have to
hold the
base of it the wooden part down and then
you move the metal bar and then you have
to
put the trigger over and it requires
both hands and if you're not careful
when you're trying to
set it you'll snap your finger under
there
and the smaller traps probably won't
hurt if you snap your finger
but the bigger ones that are probably
the size of this trap
that are with that metal bar will
probably hurt your finger
and uh in some cases you may actually
get injured in the process
um but this one it allows you to like i
say set
one hand all you gotta do is the back
end of it just push down
to the catches and it's set
just that simple um so no snapping your
fingers or anything of that nature
the trigger and this particular trap is
this
black piece right here whoa good thing i
have my thumb back there
but this piece right here you press down
and it releases
and it snaps down and if you notice
there's a
thing in the middle here that thing in
the middle is actually where your bait
goes
and so you can put peanut butter uh
i think they suggested peanut butter or
maybe like some fruit like raisins or
something like that nature but it
actually
unscrews you just twist it out and it
comes out of there at the bottom
and then um you put whatever you want to
in there as far as bait goes
then you put it back in twist it in on
the bottom
right here and it's ready to go
and so um this i i recommend this trap
having that it actually stayed
and caught a rat uh reasons being and i
recommend it one
it was set for over a year um
most traps they won't stay set for that
long
sometimes because of the trigger is a
little bit too sensitive
so like you know a couple specks of dust
land on it and it'll snap on its own
um other traps
you know they just through the expansion
and traction
of the springs through the heat and so
forth they snap that way
but this one did not so i was kind of
surprised by that
and i'm glad it actually did work the
second reason that i would recommend
this particular trap
is because of the mechanism of how it
keeps
rats the teeth on here will
grab and whatever it grabs is going to
hold because of that teeth
those wooden wraps with the metal bar
there are stories of where the trap
snapped
and the rat because the trap was
undersized for the animal that was
trying to be captured
um the the rat was actually just able to
slide back out
even though it hit him it didn't hit him
in the right way
where uh like it didn't hit him across
the head it like hit
like behind the head probably towards
the back
and so it was able to take that hit and
then just slide his way out by
using his legs to push on the wooden
piece and slide out
that those teeth on here you can push on
here as hard as you want to but because
those teeth
actually kind of bite in and as you see
the teeth
are interlocking it doesn't let go
this particular rat when it snapped now
mind you i was asleep
when it when it all happened and i kind
of was freaked out
in the middle of the night um but when
it happened
uh all i heard i woke up to like a just
a
beating like and it's like in the world
is going on
and so what i actually figured out and
put two and two together with
was that as you see this spot here
doesn't have a lot of insulation on it
and so i think what happened was the rat
found the trap and stuck his head in
there
and when it snapped it tried to
do like a barrel roll type deal to get
out of
the trap but because the rat you know
that trap was not gonna let it go
it it didn't let go and it just rolled
and rolled the road and so
the banging noise was the trap knocking
on the back side of the draw wall that
you see in this picture here
so um yeah like i say you can fight it
all you want to
uh but or these the rats can fight it
all they want to
was not get out at all
and so and i guess
one of the main things about it is uh
even when it snapped it didn't it didn't
instantly kill the rat
uh based on how i was able to see how it
snapped on the head but it did contain a
head
and i really actually snapped the
rat on his head it didn't even grab like
the neck
and so uh but because it grabbed the
head and it wasn't able to go anywhere
and then the hot temperatures that are
in a
typical attic um you know basically the
rat
suffocated uh from the hot temperatures
if it didn't suffocate from the hot
temperatures
uh it suffocated from this pretty much
cutting off
the probably breeding that nature
um the third reason i would recommend
this particular
trap is you actually have to look inside
of the trap so if you see
up here and i don't want to get a pen i
don't want this to accidentally snap
but if you see right in
better yet i here get one you can
actually see but if you see right in
here
there's a little spike kind of difficult
to see
there's a spike right here and so this
spike
actually lines up with the hole
there you go this spike lines up with
the hole where the bait goes
in the trap and so what happens is if
the
when the trap snaps if the rat has
its head in that place
and the trap snaps the rat gets stabbed
in the head so it's like
instant death um when it happened in
this particular scenario
uh looking at the aftermath of it the
head was slightly off
of the opening so i'm thinking he
probably was kind of skeptic
at first maybe he managed to stick his
head in
i'm not fully sure but in either
scenario the head was not square so he
didn't die
um but you know some traps do have that
but this trap does have that set up so
that your head in there
die immediately um but it has to be in
the right spot
so that's kind of like the downside to
it
now to talk about some of the cons of
this particular trap
it is a little bit more expensive than
the typical basic rat trap that has the
metal
base i mean excuse me the wooden base
with the metal bars
on it um those traps in my area
run for about a dollar to a dollar and
fifty us dollars that is
and this particular trap runs from about
seven to eight bucks us dollars
so fairly more expensive but this trap
is reusable it's designed to be reusable
in part it is made out of plastic
instead of like the cheaper
wood and metal ones that you would get
um
and to be honest with you i would
i i would since i have caught this rat
and i do have two of these style of
traps
i'm going to actually go ahead and set
these back in the attic
uh again and who knows something else
may
manage to get up there but i'd rather
have the traps up there and they never
catch anything
than to have critters running around and
there's nothing
that can catch them um so i
know i i think this is a great
investment in my opinion
if you have any questions or comments
you know or
negative points that you bought this
trap and didn't like about it
feel free in the comments feel free to
share those in the comments
below um i'm willing to discuss that
with you and any other questions that
you may have
so that will then wrap things up for
this video i ask you to please give this
video a thumbs up
and also leave a comment have any
questions
drop those below and don't forget to
subscribe so until next time
peace out</p>
