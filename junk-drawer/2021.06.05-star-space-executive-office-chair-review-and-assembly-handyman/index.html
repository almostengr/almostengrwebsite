      <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>The chair that I previous had, experienced a lot more wear and tear during the pandemic as I was working
from home. Not to mention, the chair had seen better days. It was manufactured in 1965 (really it has the
date stamped on the bottom), so it was time for an upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I purchased a replacement chair. I had considered gaming chairs, but those were not as comfortable. Thus
this executive office chair. I talk about it in more detail in the video below.</p>
<h2 id="transcript-unedited">Transcript (Unedited)</h2>
<p>what's going on good people this
saturday project is putting together
a office chair i uh
you know due to the coronavirus and
working from home the previous office
chair that i had
got worn out and given the age of the
chair
uh i figured all right it's time to go
ahead and get a new one
what should i get so i'm gonna share
with you what i got
as well as the assembly of said chair
<em>Music</em>
all right so this is the office chair
that i ended up purchasing
i got it off that uh amazon i'll just be
honest
uh this chair is the is an
office exec executive office chair now i
know a lot of people like
why didn't you get a gaming chair well i
looked into the gaming chairs
and the thing about the gaming chairs
that i saw is they did not have
enough padding they are
while they are cheap and functional and
they look
cool they do not necessarily support you
for
sitting for extended periods of time
and looking at the reviews and some of
the commentary that other people that
have said that um yeah
i'm glad i didn't buy those gaming
chairs i actually had a cousin
that bought one of those gaming chairs
and so when we did
a zoom meeting for thanksgiving with our
family members
um you know i saw him in one of the
chairs that he got off of the gaming
chairs that he got off amazon
and so i asked him about it i was like
hey how you feel about that chair that
you sitting in
and yeah pretty much his consensus was
he hates it
and so uh he mentioned a lot of what i
saw which is is not as comfortable
and that it um you know he kind of
wished that he got something a little
bit better
so um and as you see i am sitting in the
chair that i am talking about so
uh i'm not making this up i actually do
use what i'm talking about
so this particular chair uh it is very
comfortable it does have
a weight capacity of 400 pounds now
obviously you can tell and you've seen
me in other videos
that i'm nowhere near close to 400
pounds but i wanted a chair
that was uh sturdy enough um
you know and not just like borderline
uh at the limits because you know things
happen
right you know i could sit in the chair
and then pick up i don't know
a heavy book or something and bam the
chair breaks that's not
that's not a situation that i want to be
in um
so uh i chose to share like i say
weight capacity uh the legs on this
chair are
metal not plastic like you would get
with a lot of those gaming chairs that
you see on amazon
they usually have plastic wheels with a
plastic legs and the
failure point on those chairs are
usually
the legs because that's where your
weight capacity comes in at
um and also the weight capacity on those
chairs from what i was able to see
was right around 200 to maybe 225 now
i'm like 185
so 200 is not that far of a stretch for
me
like if i eat a big meal i could
probably get close to 200.
so um i was kind of wanting something
with a little bit more weight capacity
and so this
chair came up as one of those options um
also as i mentioned the padding on this
chair this padding on this chair is
rather thick it's very comfortable like
i sit here and
a lot of times you know i'm working from
home because of the virus
but then also after i get done working
from home
then i continue to sit here and work on
videos like this or i work on coding
projects that i have
so something else and you know 10 12
even in some cases
14 hours in this chair and i don't feel
sore or anything of that nature
one other thing i wanted to point out is
for me so i'm six feet tall
and so the back of the chair is while
it's right at the bottom of my head i
wanted something that did have
support for my upper back um because
the chair that i have at my office like
work office
uh it does have full body support up
here and it actually has even a headrest
and so uh this one doesn't have a
headrest unfortunately and i kind of
wish it did but
i'm okay with it at least supporting my
shoulders and upper back
because that's where a lot of your
attention um that
in your lower back is where your tension
comes in when you're sitting for
extended periods of time
so i'm going to get into this assembly
so this is obviously the box that it
came in
50 pounds a pretty big box um i want to
say maybe two feet by
three feet uh as you see it says 50
pounds well excuse me 56 pounds is the
gross weight the chair itself is 50
pounds
so a very sturdy chair um so here are
the instructions
um everything that comes in here not
many parts
as you may think it may have uh like i
said it was a lot of it was already
pre-assembled
so the mechanical portions of like the
seat that raises and lowers
the chair itself is already assembled in
one piece
you just have to attach it to the base
of the chair it has
these set of bolts um and then it comes
with a tool to put everything together
so literally i did not have to go get
any tools
um the tool came with it
all right so i have in this photo taking
the
base out of the box as i mentioned the
base is made out of metal
and all you gotta do to put the wheels
in there are holes in the base
and you just slide them in and they lock
in on their own
and then here is the pack of bolts and
the
tool as well as the plastic caps that
come with it uh
just follow the instructions on how to
assemble it so
this is the mechanical portion of the
chair so this is what controls the up
and down movement as well as the rock
back functionality
usually i don't lock the chair uh from
rocking back
unlike some chairs this chair does not
have the functionality where
you can lock it in like various degrees
you either lock it straight up or you
don't lock it at all so that's kind of a
sucky part like if you like to slightly
recline back and lock your chair
this chair won't do that like i can i'm
leaning back now as you see
but it's still going to move but once i
sit up
i don't know if you can hear that on
camera but that's that click that you
just
probably heard was the chair actually
locking in the upright position so now
it won't go back
and then i can unlock it and i will go
back and then the other
handle over here is for the height
adjustment i keep this chair at the
highest level that is sitting
like i mentioned i'm six feet tall so my
legs are
literally angled straight across in this
position
i wanted a chair that was a little bit
higher um but
you know given the value and so forth
this was the kind of the best of the
deal in terms of
chair height and comfort level
all right and here's another angle it
clearly marks where the front is
and so you see front here as well as the
front on the
mounting portion so you make sure those
are both pointing in the same direction
i did put the arms on um it's a step in
here that mentions about putting the
arms on you do have to screw them on on
the side
there i had some difficulties getting
the
<em>Music</em>
back of the chair connected to the arms
because the back of the chair actually
connects to the arms it does not connect
to the seat
of this chair so that's how that stays
up but i was able to i had to loosen
some of the other screws
in on the chair to be able to get the
back to properly align with one of the
screws that had some difficulties with
and then once i did that then everything
was able to be
tightened up as far as the back of the
chair and the armrests are concerned
so i am happy with it i um i believe i
paid about
250 for this chair um
i give or take maybe 25 on that
and so uh this sheriff so far i've been
using it
um for about three months now and it's
held up pretty well
um one other thing i want to know
is so a lot of those gaming chairs that
i was looking at
uh they have like faux leather or like
polyester or some other
non-breathing type material that they
are made of
this has a it's not full
leather is i think it may be like a
something similar to leather so it's a
little bit durable but not exactly
the gaming chair quality that you would
think
um you know it's not the gaming chair
fabric that you would
want on this type of chair and so um but
it does work
i know somebody else that i had a
customer that had a similar chair to
this this one
uh the one that they had though it was
it was the same brand
but it was not as executive level
if you will of a chair it has the same
functionality it had the same assembly
instructions too
but their chair actually had a uh the
back of the chair vibrated
and you basically plugged in your
laptop to the chair and the chair got
the power to run the massager from the
laptop
very interesting concept um
but you know i think it was a pretty
cool chair i'm not sure how much they
paid for it
but i know that that's how that chair
was designed so
um yeah there's that
if you have any questions about this
feel free to drop a comment down below
i'll be glad to answer anything to the
best of my ability regarding the
assembly of the chair
or the review of this chair and how it
has played out thus far um or in the
future
