As you can imagine, the course is designed for Canadians, but I found that the concepts, ideas, and terminology could be applied to individuals in other countries. I was able to complete the course in about 4-5 hours (I did it all on Christmas Eve).</p> <p>The article that was written about the course, gives more insight into what the course is about and who it is designed for. Once you complete the course, you will receive a certificate of completion. Feel free to <a href=https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2019/12/13/mcgill-university-offers-free-online-financial-literacy-course-for-everybody/ target=_blank>read the article</a>.</p> <p>Below are my notes from the course. They are not well structured, but I did make an effort to note the key points that were mentioned in each section. I have also included my test results from each section in case you want to compare your results to mine. For each section, you have to get 80% or greater in order to pass each module.</p> <p>I would encourage you to take the course for yourself even if you are good with money. I consider myself to be good with money, but did not realize until I got to Module 8 that there is a psychological aspect to how well or bad you are with money and investing.</p> <h2 id=module-1-intro>Module 1, Intro</h2> <p>No notes from this section.</p> <p>No test for this section.</p> <h2 id=module-2-debt-and-borrowing>Module 2, Debt and Borrowing</h2> <h3 id=common-sources-of-debt>Common Sources of Debt</h3> <ul> <li>understand what sources of credit are most appropriate</li> <li>terms and conditions for the type of debt</li> </ul> <h4 id=credit-cards>Credit Cards</h4> <ul> <li>are easier to obtain</li> <li>rewards and benefits</li> <li>look at the fees and interest rates</li> <li>a card may have a high rate, but the benefits can outweigh the rate</li> </ul> <h4 id=lines-of-credit>Lines of Credit</h4> <ul> <li>operates similar to checking account as it gives debit cards or is connected to checks</li> <li>it accrues interest immediately</li> <li>usually has lower fees and interest rates than credit cards</li> <li>people often usually take out a larger balance for line of credit than for credit cards as they have lower rates</li> </ul> <h4 id=long-term-financing>Long Term Financing</h4> <ul> <li>usually used for larger costs assets, cars, or houses</li> <li>if you don't pay for it in full, then the asset is repossessed</li> <li>the asset is collateral</li> </ul> <h4 id=mortgages>Mortgages</h4> <ul> <li>used specifically for buying a home</li> <li>minimum down payment is usually required, 5% to 20%</li> <li>down payment cant be used from other sources, like line of credit</li> <li>mortgage loan insurance covers the lender in case you default</li> <li>a change of the mortgage term will require agreement between the two parties involved</li> <li>loans are amortized</li> <li>type of interest rate is a consideration. mortgage payments stay the same with fixed rates.
