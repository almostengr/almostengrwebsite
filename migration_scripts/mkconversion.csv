"# Identify Circuits and Label Breaker Panel<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Professional Engineer (Expert)**<br /><br />This video describes how I went about identifying the breakers in my breaker panel.<br />The panel only had 4 of the 26 breakers labeled. So by labelling, it would be easier to know which breaker to switch off in the future in case an issue occurred.<br /><br /><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/23VdXB1eYdQ"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-02-16 11:00:02**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-06-13 21:02:04**<br /><br />";"2019.02.16-identify-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel.md"

This helped narrow down the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are utilized during a flush.  It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it was good that it was caught at this point.

"# Automatically Publish Content with Custom Module<br /><br />!(images/Screenshot from 2019-03-07 22-30-01.png)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Degree Holding (Advanced)**<br /><br />If you want to run a blog, one of the best time saving techniques is writing your content ahead of time and then it is released on a schedule that you set.<br />Drupal does have a module that will do just that. However the process to schedule a post was badly designed in my opinion. That being said, I decided to write my own module that would handle this functionality for me. By writing my own module, I can customize the module how I choose without having additional features that I do not need. In case you are wondering whether this works or not, I am using the code below to publish the blog posts on this website.<br /><br />First you'll need to create a content type if you don't already have one. With Drupal 7, go to Structure &gt; Content Types to create a new content type. When creating the content type, take note to the Machine Name that is associated with your content type. You'll need this later.<br />Next let's take a look at the code:<br /><br />```function almostengr_publish_posts() {<br /> $result = db_query(""select nid from {node} where created &lt;= :datetime and promote = :promote and status = :status and type = :type"",<br />	array("":datetime"" =&gt; REQUEST_TIME, "":promote"" =&gt; 1, "":status"" =&gt; 0, "":type"" =&gt; ""article""));<br /> foreach($result as $row) {<br />   $article = node_load($row-&gt;nid);<br />   $article-&gt;status = 1; // update the status<br />   $article-&gt;comment = 2; // enable comments<br />   node_save($article); // save article<br /> } // end foreach<br />} // end function<br />```<br />The code above queries the node table for the node IDs that have a created date before the current date and time, are selected to be promoted to the front page, are not published, and have a type of article. Then each node that matches the queried condition, will be loaded, have the node status updated to published and the comments enabled, and then saved.<br />Next need to create a cron process that will handle this further. We will do this in code too.<br /><br />```function almostengr_cron() {<br /> almostengr_publish_posts();<br />} // end function<br />```<br /><br />With the code above, we are using cron to call the publish posts function. The cron function within the module that you create will be automatically called via the Drupal hook_cron functionality.<br /><br />Now to the creating of content. When you create a new node, you need to do the following for it to be scheduled to be published:<br />* Set the Created Date to the date and time that you wish the article to be published* Promoted to Front Page selected* Published status is **not **selected* Save the content<br />That's it. The custom module that you have created will take of the rest.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-05-09 12:17:05**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-05 12:02:51**<br /><br />";"2019.05.09-automatically-publish-content-with-custom-module.md"

Just a demostration showing the process of what I did get it done.<br />Just removing a dead and decaying tree limb from a tree. The limb has been dead for some time. It was resting a branch that was in front of it. Also some of the upper limbs would break off during windy conditions, thus creating a safety hazard.<br />The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking.<br />Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free.<br />Next I tried to push down the branch. However this did not work as I was not able to get much leverage from pushing. In addition, the limb would slide back after pushing.<br />Since that attempt failed, I got a tow rope and connected it to the tree. The tow rope was slick, so I put a shovel on the other end of the rope to use it as a handle.<br />After a number of pulls, I was able to get the branch down on the ground so that it can be removed and no longer a safety hazard.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-03-16 09:30:02**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-04-05 23:47:29**<br /><br />";"2019.03.16-manual-tree-branch-tear-down.md"
"# identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Degree Holding (Advanced)**<br /><br />*Video Transcript* <br /><br />Thanks for checking out this video. I'm going to show you how to go around and identify the outlets and the lights and which breaker they are connected to in your breaker panel. <br />Thanks for tuning in. if you have not already please subscribe down in the button below. so when you go to do electrical work i.e. if you're changing out a light switch if a plug has an issue and you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to.  in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself.<br /><br />the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the ones that are odd numbered starting with the top down you have one event all the way down to the harbor mini Breakers that you have on that particular side so on my outside the breaker number highest ranking number is 25 so I will stop at 25 and then I will start with the even numbers of 2 4 and 6 and I was like that and then use autocomplete to and at 26 which is the highest number that I have on the right hand side so the first record that I have in the number one position is the bath Outlet as well as the exterior Outlets saw internet in and then I will also include the amperage which is 28 and then I will go to the next one which is not connected so I'll just know that is not connected and then I will put in the next two are the air conditioner compressor or connected to the air conditioner compressor and then I will continue this process and then once I get all the way filled in down to 25 and print this out I will actually cut this between Rose 14 and 15 and I will actually add another header here on row 15 so insert an entire row and then copy this header here so that and I can add as actually had another roll so that I have some spacing in between so when I do go to cut this I don't have to be very exact with my cut and sew cut this between here and then so I have the even breakers on one side and then excuse me. Breakers on one side and then he even bring his on the other side now if you have a panel where the door opens sideways you could actually move emails over so that they are side-by-side like this and that way you can better see and then you only have to use one shut up a paper printout to do this however since my breaker panel actually opens up instead of to the left or to the right and going to do this way and split it sideways so I can put them side-by-side on next to space in between the edge of the breaker in the edge of the panel in the breaker itself so for the sales that are really long like this one and these here but I'm actually going to do is through this entire column and set it to do word wrap in LibreOffice calc need to go to text and a text under the format menu and then you can resize a column into text Will resize accordingly and so I'm going to actually shorten breaker number to this breaker and that way it'll allow me to use this room here I can you guys leave an abbreviated if you want to use for space and so I do have one breaker here that is a arc fault or ground-fault breaker breaker actually labeled in the end column that it isn't scription of that is our Breakers to clearly distinguish some reason this sale did not wrap correctly so you may have simply of formatting issues that come up like this and just have to go in and double check on them and if worst case we align the row to get it to do right to be here now is doing correctly are you in some places use the abbreviations to try to help with the wrapping so for instance here instead of spelling kitchen out I just took out all of the files that were in the word kitchen until you get something here that resembles the kitchen counter so counter counter I took out all the vowels yet again so you have cnpr you can kind of figure that out just no reasoning and same thing here with front how do you say it's not fully showing a hold of wrapping correctly so the same thing here with fry and so I will also do the headings on this one and make those bold you know that goes are there and then if you want to you can actually make these rolls alternate Colors video but it's pretty straightforward you know how to adjust the Lights theme background color of a particular role so that I can clearly read all the way across which role you know which item is so if I'm looking for the dryer and I can't cross here and say okay will dryer is 30 amps I can locate fryer bicep on the amperage or I can locate it based upon the position and once you have completed this be sure to save a copy of this in the reason I say that is cuz in the future if you happen to add breaker Outlets name something that say you add an outlet in a new room or you add an additional light in the new room then you know you can go here instead of retyping this all the way over you just make that necessary addition and then free printed back out and stick it back in your breaker box I'm out stop attic grid lines instead of using beat coloring technique will be far easier to read his follow your line finger across the line of the dates and that way you know somebody comes along in the future they won't have to guess when this was last updated though clearly so they know if anything has changed between this date and the current date of whenever they're looking at it then they can reprint this out and put a updated label inside a breaker box so as you see I've completed the printout of the stuff that I was going to do on the computer with the labeling then I've covered it in mailing tape as my breaker panel is outside hopefully this will protect it against the weather and any other elements that may come in contact with the labels I have a copy of this saved on my computer so I can go in and print out additional labels in the future if needed if I need to make any adjustments I can make those adjustments on the print out and then print them back out again this process has helped you in identifying and labeling your breaker panel if you have any questions or comments please leave those in the comments section below if this video has helped you please give this video a thumbs up ​​​​​​​<br /><br />**Posted: 2019-06-11 21:52:09**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-06-29 22:23:47**<br /><br />";"2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel.md"
"# Copying Infested Code<br /><br />!(images/7863679378_028521b7fc_b.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Degree Holding (Advanced)**<br /><br />As some of you may know, my current role consists of me building and maintaining automations. The thing about writing code is that at some point, maintenance has to be done on the code to keep it up to date and to add future enhancements and functionality. <br /><br />## WHAT KIND OF PEST (THE PROBLEM)<br /><br />Squirrels and rats both chew on wood.  However they do not eat the same stuff, so you have to be selective with the bait that you choose. For most of the automations that I build, I use Selenium Webdriver as the automations are for web-based applications.   Recently, we have noticed that number of automations have not been running due to “connection refused” exceptions.  The connection is being refused from the automation jar not connecting to the Gecko Driver (the interface between Webdriver automation and the browser). Applying knowledge that I have of computers, normally you only see “connection refused” messages when one or more of the scenarios occur 1) too many devices trying to connect at the same time, also referred to as Denial of Service Attack or Distributed Denial of Service Attack 2) a firewall is rejecting the connection 3) wrong password when trying to authenticate. <br /><br />## TRACKING DOWN THE PEST (THE ANALYSIS)<br /><br />I was able to immediately rule out scenarios 2 and 3 because the automation would work majority of the time. In other words, we know it is not a rat based on the evidence. Therefore, through the process of elimination, it must be a squirrel. Majority being that out of 7 days of the week that it was used, it would fail only on 1 of those days. I then did some research on the internet that provided a number of causes and solutions for the exception occurring. Some of the causes included <br />* the Gecko Driver process not being able to write to a log file because existing log file already exists (not in our case)<br />* having concurrent Webdriver automations running at the same time (which wasn’t our case as we have done several at the same time in the past)<br />* to the hosts file not having the localhost IP address entered (which we did not, but nslookup and ping commands both returned valid IP addresses)<br />* having bad code.  <br /><br />I got to that last reason in the list, bad code, and I put more effort into looking into the code as we have experienced (2+ years) and inexperienced developers on our team. <br /><br />## FOUND THE NEST (FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM)<br /><br />After search through multiple automation projects, shaking my head at some of the exact examples of bad code mentioned in Robert Martin’s *Clean Code*, I hit the bullseye. Several of the automations had the same code. Yes… copied and pasted. First person got it working, so the next person got theirs working by doing exactly what the first person did. There's that saying about if you see one bug, there's probably another one not too far way.  This would be it. To make it worse, it was multiplying everytime the code was copy and pasted. This is what I found: <br /><br />```java<br />WebDriver driver = null;<br /><br />try{	<br />   driver = new FirefoxDriver();<br />   driver.get(""http://thealmostengineer.com"");<br /><br />   // other Webdriver steps go here <br /><br />   driver.quit();<br />   System.exit(0);<br />} catch (Exception exception) {<br />   exception.printStackTrace();<br />   System.exit(1);<br />}<br />```<br /><br />Now this is just a snippet of the actual code.  Obviously, I cannot put the entire code here because of confidentiality. Do you notice the problem with this code? <br /><br />The problem here is that if an exception occurs between the ```try``` and ```driver.quit();```, the browser and as a result, the Gecko Driver process never exits. What happens when you have too many processes running?  The system will hang. What happens when there are too many connections open to a process? Some of those connections are refused. <br /><br />## SPRAYING THE BUG SPRAY (THE SOLUTION)<br /><br />To now rid the varmint of our code, I had to fix the defect that I identified. The ```driver.quit();``` should always be executed regardless of whether the exception occurs.  The reason being is that you do not want to the browser nor the Gecko Driver process running as they will hang up your system or result in the ""connection refused"" exceptions. So I changed the above code to the code below: <br /><br />```java<br />WebDriver driver = null;<br />int exitCode = 1;<br /><br />try{	<br />   driver = new FirefoxDriver();<br />   driver.get(""http://thealmostengineer.com"");<br /><br />   // other Webdriver steps go here <br /><br />   exitCode = 0;<br />} catch (Exception exception) {<br />   exception.printStackTrace();<br />}<br /><br />driver.quit();<br />System.exit(exitCode);<br />```<br /><br />The changes that I made: <br /><br />* the ```driver.quit();``` has been moved outside of the try-catch block. That way it will always execute whether an exception occurs or not.   Could a ```finally```block been used?  Yes. However, for the sake of simplifying the code I did not use one.<br />* I moved the ```System.exit``` call to the end of the code. It is best to have only one way to exit a function.  If you have multiple ways to exit (or return) out of a function, code that needs to exit may not get executed because of the multiple ways out.<br />* I created a new integer variable called ```exitCode```.  Following standards for program exit code, 1 means that something went wrong during execution. 0 means that everything went well during execution. Therefore, the variable defaults to 1 because you do not want your code to say that all went well when it actually did not. It is better to have a false failure and it get noticed than to have a false success and it go undetected. <br /><br />## CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you are going to copy the code of others, please be sure to review it first before using it as it may have defects already in it. If you do not know what the code does, then spend a few moments searching for those commands or snippets online so that you learn what they do. Using code somebody else wrote without confirming that it is not defective, is like building a chair from wood and not checking to see if it is rotting or has termites. <br /><br /><br /><p style=""font-size: 0.9rem;font-style: italic;""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/63753633@N02/7863679378"">""Rotting.""</a><span>by <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/63753633@N02"">AisforAmy91</a></span> is licensed under <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&atype=html"" style=""margin-right: 5px;"">CC BY-ND 2.0</a><a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&atype=html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""display: inline-block;white-space: none;opacity: .7;margin-top: 2px;margin-left: 3px;height: 22px !important;""><img style=""height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;"" src=""https://search.creativecommons.org/static/img/cc_icon.svg"" /><img style=""height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;"" src=""https://search.creativecommons.org/static/img/cc-by_icon.svg"" /><img style=""height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;"" src=""https://search.creativecommons.org/static/img/cc-nd_icon.svg"" /></a><br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-09-05 14:14:04**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-09-05 14:38:34**<br /><br />";"2019.09.05-copying-infested-code.md"

"# Set up Gecko Driver on Ubuntu<br /><br />!(images/Screenshot from 2019-03-23 11-59-18.png)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: College Dropout (Intermediate)**<br /><br />Selenium Webdriver can be used to automate routine tasks and to perform regression tests.<br />Currently I build automations using Selenium Webdriver and Sikuli to automate routine daily tasks. Since I maintain multiple websites, I figured that I could use this same technology to perform the code updates on the websites that I manage.<br />Selenium Webdriver has some first time setup steps that have to be done in order for you to be able to build the automations.<br />My browser of choice is Firefox. Some people reading this will not be thrilled about that, but everyone has their preferences. If you like to use Chrome, or worse Internet Explorer, then the steps mentioned below are similar to those for Firefox. However this post focuses on setting up with Firefox.<br />First thing that you will need to do is to have Eclipse or similar IDE installed on your computer. That will not be covered in this post.<br />Next, download the Gecko Driver. That can be downloaded from <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver"">https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver</a>. The Gecko Driver serves as a middle man between Webdriver and the web browser. The web browser cannot directly communicate or interact with the web browser. What happens is Webdriver interacts with the Gecko Driver. Then the Gecko Driver translates those interactions into actions that the browser can perform. Once the action is performed, then response is sent back from the browser to the Gecko Driver to Webdriver.<br />Next, create a Maven project. In the pom.xml file, you will need to add the following dependency to the file:<br />``` &lt;dependency&gt;<br>  &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;<br>  &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br>  &lt;version&gt;3.14.0&lt;/version&gt;<br> &lt;/dependency&gt;```<br /><br />At the time of this writing, 3.14.0 version, was the second latest versoin that was available. I would recommend using the latest or later version that is available.<br />Next, add the Java code below to your main function. This is the simpliest code to get an automation running with Firefox.<br />```System.setProperty(""webdriver.gecko.driver"", ""/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver""); // define geckodriver location<br>WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser<br>driver.get(""http://google.com""); // open the website of choice<br>Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen<br>driver.quit(); // close browser ```<br /><br />In the above, ""```/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver```<br />"" will need to be replaced with the location that you have downloaded the Gecko Driver.<br />If you choose, you may also change the website that the browser opens.<br />Now you may run the application that you have built. If done correctly, you will see the browser open, then the Google home page appear, then the browser close. There may be some red text in the Java console, but there is no need to be alarmed by this unless there is an exception mentioned.<br />The code used here can be downloaded from my Github repository at <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial"">https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial</a><br /><br /><br />The entire file Java file would look like the following:<br />```package com.thealmostengineer.seleniumtutorial;<br /><br />import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;<br />import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;<br /><br />/**<br />* Hello world!<br />*<br />*/<br />public class App <br />{<br />   static void geckoDriverTest() throws Exception {<br />	System.setProperty(""webdriver.gecko.driver"", ""/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver"");<br />       WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser<br />       driver.manage().window().maximize(); // maximize the browser window<br />       driver.get(""http://google.com"");<br />       Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen<br />       driver.quit(); // close browser<br />   }<br />	<br />   public static void main( String[] args )<br />   {<br />   	try {<br />		geckoDriverTest();<br />	} catch (Exception e) {<br />		// TODO Auto-generated catch block<br />		e.printStackTrace();<br />	}    	<br />   }<br />}<br />```<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-04-05 23:44:59**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-04-05 23:45:24**<br /><br />";"2019.04.05-set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu.md"

"# Takeaways from Christopher Robin movie<br /><br />**Engineer Level: College Dropout (Intermediate)**<br /><br />Every year during the month of November, the church that I attend does a series where movies are used to provide examples and metaphors of the Word. This week's particular movie was ""Disney's Christopher Robin"". As I was in church, watching this message and movie, it spoke to me given the number of changes that were taking place in my life. <br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: I do mention scenes from the movie. So if you have not watched the movie yet and hate spoilers, go watch the movie before reading this article.  <br /><br />## Things That I Got From This Movie<br /><br />### Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something<br /><br />Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there’s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest.  This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil. <br /><br />### When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset<br /><br />There’s a song, called ""Holy Ghost Power"" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says ""Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power"". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you’ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them.  In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result.<br /><br />### We Are Not Who We Used To Be. Sometimes We Become Lost<br /><br />The smartest of people make mistakes. We are all human. When a bridge failure or airplane malfunction occurs, often the maintainers and engineers get the blame. The investigators often go back to the original drawings and design to see if there were any miscalculations, typos, or other errors that were overlooked. Once those errors are identified, they are corrected so that they do not occur again. Whether it be redrawing the bridge or redesigning a component of the plane, it has now become better and it is not what it used to be. In the movie, this was reflected by Christopher Robin going back to the Hundred Acre Wood. Once there and Christopher Robin had to show the other inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood that he was indeed Christopher Robin as they last remembered him being a young boy and not a man. I like to refer to this as ""growth and development"". <br /><br />### Find What Makes You Happy<br /><br />In the movie, Christopher Robin and Pooh are at the train station trying to catch the train to take Pooh back home. Pooh sees a balloon stand and says that he wants a balloon. Christopher initially says no but then gives in after Pooh mentions that the balloon will bring him happiness. Getting big things and dreams accomplished do bring us happiness, but sometimes it is the small things that can bring us the most happiness. For me, that would mean being in the presence of others, also known as quality time, that brings the greatest amount of happiness. <br /><br />## Conclusion <br /><br />Everything happens for a reason.  For me, it felt like perfect timing as these takeaway points and more are steps that I need to take to go forward in life. <br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-11-24 20:26:49**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-11-24 20:29:56**<br /><br />";"2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie.md"

"# Linux: rm Argument list too long<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />A problem that occasionally occurs is that when attempting to remove files in Unix or Linux system is that when you attempt to remove files from a directory, you are not able to do so.  This only happens when you have too many files in a particular directory.  <br /><br />What happens when you run ```rm *```<br />is that the OS gets the names of all the files in the directory that match that condition (which would be everything in this case) and changes the command to ```rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt ...```<br />You get the idea.  The problem is sometimes the argument list is too long and the command is not able to process all of the files that are in the directory.  As a result, you'll get a ""Argument list too long"" error message and none of the files being deleted. <br /><br />How do you get around this problem? Here's the solution: <br /><br />```<br />for x in $(ls -1)<br />do<br />echo $x<br />rm $x<br />done<br />```<br /><br /><br />What does this do?  Lets explain: <br /><br />* ```for x in $(ls -1)```<br />gets all of the files that are in the directory.<br />* ```do```<br />denotes the beginning of the for loop<br />* ```echo $x```<br />will print out the name of the file that is being removed so that you can monitor the progress.<br />* ```rm $x```<br />removes the file.  The name of the file that is being removed was printed out by the previous line<br />* ```done```<br />denotes the end of the for loop<br /><br /><br /><br />If you have to clean up directories that often contain a lot of files, then placing this command in a script would be recommended than running it from the command line each time you need it.<br /><br />Other examples for using this command are as follows: <br />```<br />for x in $(ls -1 | grep 2016 | awk '{print $9}')<br />do<br />echo $x<br />rm $x<br />done<br />```<br /><br />This will remove all the files that have ""2016"" in the file name, year, or file size. <br /><br />```<br />for x in $(ls -1 *hello* | awk '{print $9}')<br />do<br />echo $x<br />rm $x<br />done<br />```<br /><br />This will remove all the files that have ""hello"" in the file name.<br /><br />**Posted: 2017-04-03 01:06:37**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-12 21:03:06**<br /><br />";"2017.04.03-linux-rm-argument-list-too-long.md"
"# Liftmaster 8500 Review, 1 Year Later<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />1 year ago, I installed the Liftmaster 8500 on my garage door.  I cover the pros and cons that I have experienced during that time.  How is the Liftmaster 8500 performing a year it has been installed?  I will show you.  One year ago, I installed this Liftmaster 8500 garage door opener.  I bought it online and it came with everything I needed including the MyQ internet gateway.  <br /><br /><br />The first pro about this garage door open is that it is very quiet.  If I open the garage door while I'm on the other side of the house, I barely hear it  open.  The deadbolt that comes with the door actually is lower than the motor itself when it is  running.  <br /><br />The second pro with this is that the garage door opener is very easy to install.  If you're like me and you already have a garage door in place but just didn't have the opener,  this kit can be done very easily and quickly as a DIY task on a Saturday.  I had all of the necessary tools required to install it including the drill, some pliers,  may need a hammer or two as well.  I did have to mount some 2 by 4s to attach the opener as well as some of the sensors  to.  But outside of that, everything that was needed came with the kit.  <br /><br />The third pro for this garage door opener is that it came with the MyQ internet gateway.  The MyQ app allows you to open the garage door remotely so that you don't have to be  in the physical presence of the door.  This is great when you have to allow somebody in whether they are dropping off packages  or need to be let in the house like kids after school and you don't want to give them a key.  This particular garage door opener model support battery backup.  So if the power were to ever go out or you live in an area where the power frequently  goes out, you're always able to get inside of your garage if you have the battery backup.  Now I did not purchase the battery backup as my power is pretty consistent in staying  on majority of the time.  <br /><br />The fourth pro is that you're able to install this on the side of the garage door opener  instead of overhead.  The thing about being able to install it on the side of the garage door is that it leaves  more ceiling space for you to be able to do other things including installing overhead  lights or installing a ceiling fan.  In my case, I do have a ceiling fan in my garage.  I do live in the south, so in the summer time the garage gets pretty hot and the fan becomes  very essential in those time especially when you're working on a car or working on something  else in the garage.  Now to talk about the cons of this particular garage door model.  <br /><br /><br />The first con is that the garage door light does not always turn on when you go to open  the door.  At many of the times, I'll press the door open and I dont' know if it is due to network  interference or radio interference, but the light does not always turn on.  However once the door reach the top of the travel path, the light turns on. Now as I mentioned, this particular model comes with a remote light.  Meaning the light itself is not wired directly into the garage door system.  So just like the remote that you have in your car to open the garage door, the garage door  remotely controls the light using radio frequency.  Now it is possible that there is some sort of interference that sometimes occurs during  that time of day when I open to leave to go out to go to work.  However this is not always observed.  <br /><br />The second con that I have with this garage door opener is that the MyQ app will not tell  you when the door is partially open.  I've tried this on many scenarios and basically with the app and when you open the door and  it stops midway, or you intentionally stop it midway, or it stops midway on it's own,  the app wiil show in the history log that the door is registered into an unknown state.  The only problem with this is that the app cannot notify you of an unknown state.  It can only notify you of an open or closed state.  I've searched the MyQ forums as well as the Liftmaster forums, as well as the Chamberlain  forums, and none of them indicate a recommendation on how to address this issue.  The only response that I consistently saw was that they are working on a fix to include  this type of functionality.  However that was a year, maybe a year and a half ago and I haven't seen any improvement  in this request since then.  <br /><br />The third con that I have with this garage door opener is that it doesn't always immediately  close when using the MyQ app.  Often times I don't use the garage door opener that's available.  The clicker button if you will.  Instead I'll use to for the app functionality.  When I do press the button immediately after it opens to close the door right back, then  door often doesn't get the response.  However, the MyQ app shows on the screen that the door is actually going down while it is  not.  So this is a con that seems to consistently come up.  What I've found that I've had to do is to wait maybe twenty to thirty seconds after  the door fully opens and the MyQ app registers that the door is fully open.  Then close the door at that time.  <br /><br /><br />Overall, this garage door opener is a great purchase.  However the MyQ app does leave more to be desired in terms of functionality especially  in security area of notifying you when the door is partially open.

"# Every Gardener Needs a Journal<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />It's important to document your garden observations because humans are forgetful. <br /><br />Think about it... do you really remember how much fertilizer that you used 4 years ago on the tomato plants?  Probably not. <br /><br />Do you remember how many times that squirrels ate the strawberries before you did last season?  Probably not.<br /><br />Do you know how many days that it rained last summer?  Probably not. <br /><br />These are just a few examples of why you need to keep track of what you have observed and what you have done in your garden.  I use this blog as my garden journal because I'm able to share with others what I've learned from running a garden.<br /><br />**What do you need to keep track of in your journal?  That's up to you!  I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks:**<br />- weather conditions, including temperature<br />- whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water<br />- any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants <br />- when fertilizer was applied and how much <br />- when you started your seedlings<br />- when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest<br />- pictures of your observations<br /><br />**Paper or digital (online) journal? Again, it's up to you!**<br />What's more important is that you keep records so that you are able to analyze what you have done. I've chosen to do an online blog because I know I can type faster than I write. Now if you have a digital or online blog, it is easier to find what you are looking for as you can utilize the search functionality. <br /><br />For example, if you create a journal entry each time that you harvest food from your garden, you can do a search for ""harvest"" and the fruit or vegetable that you harvested and find the information quickly.  If you have a paper journal, you would have to manually look page by page until you found your latest harvest information. <br /><br />**How often should I write in my journal?**<br />I would recommend writing a new entry daily or when significant events take place.<br /><br />For instance, if you have non-stop rain for an entire week, I would make note of that in a journal entry. Planting new vegetables for the growing season, make a new journal entry. Squirrels eat half of your three tomatoes, make a journal entry (and remove the half eaten tomatoes from the vine). <br /><br />Journaling may seem pointless in the beginning when you don't have much history to look back at. However as the time progresses and you make some gardening mistakes, you'll learn from those mistakes and end up with a productive and strong garden.<br /><br />**Posted: 2019-02-23 17:14:27**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-09 22:16:31**<br /><br />";"2019.02.23-every-gardener-needs-a-journal.md"

"# Building Raised Garden Beds<br /><br />!(images/20190309_152423.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />This year, I decided to expand the growing space for my garden. As some of you may know, I have, for years, planted my fruits and vegetables mostly in containers and pots instead of directly in the ground.<br />I’ve learned a number of lessons about the differences between planting in the ground vs planting in containers. I’ll cover that in another post.<br />In this post, I will cover how I built multiple raised beds out of concrete blocks.<br /><br />**Step 1: How Big and How Many**<br />Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started. I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case.<br />For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that’s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side.<br />I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row.<br />If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks tha you need.<br /><br />**Step 2: Time To Go Shopping**<br />For this project, you will need the following:<br />*(Please consider using the affiliate links below this post. They help to support this website)*<br />* concrete blocks (see Step 1 for how many blocks)* spirit level (see link below)* 2 feet wide object (a lawn mower works)* Construction / Work Gloves* masonry adhesive (optional)<br />Why concrete blocks? Modern concrete blocks are made of just that... concrete (sand, water, cement). Considerations for using concrete blocks:<br />* the ones that you buy will mostlikely not contain any chemicals or other things that are poisionious or dangerous to your health. I would advise not getting blocks from unknown sources.* are more expensive than wood. The total amount for the 56 blocks that I purchased was $84, before discounts and taxes* have a very long outdoor life regardless of what the weather or ground conditions are like<br />If you do not have the money for concrete blocks, then wood is an option. Considerations for using wood:<br />* wood is cheaper than concrete blocks. If you are looking to do gardening for the long term, the cheaper initial cost will be negated by the recurring replacement cost of the wood* use untreated wood. Treated wood contains chemicals that can be hazardous to your health if consumed.* the outdoor life of untreated wood is shorter than that of concrete. That means that if you live in an area with a lot of rainfall or high water table, that the wood will rot faster than average and therefore will need to be replaced sooner.<br /><br />**Step 3: Site Selection**<br />After you have purchased the items above, you need to select a flat or mostly flat spot in your yard.

"# Building Raised Garden Beds<br /><br />!(images/20190309_155432_0.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />This year, I decided to expand the growing space for my garden. As some of you may know, I have, for years, planted my fruits and vegetables mostly in containers and pots instead of directly in the ground.<br />I’ve learned a number of lessons about the differences between planting in the ground vs planting in containers. I’ll cover that in another post.<br />In this post, I will cover how I built multiple raised beds out of concrete blocks.<br /><br />**Step 1: How Big and How Many**<br />Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started. I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case.<br />For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that’s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side.<br />I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row.<br />If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks tha you need.<br /><br />**Step 2: Time To Go Shopping**<br />For this project, you will need the following:<br />*(Please consider using the affiliate links below this post. They help to support this website)*<br />* concrete blocks (see Step 1 for how many blocks)* spirit level (see link below)* 2 feet wide object (a lawn mower works)* Construction / Work Gloves* masonry adhesive (optional)<br />Why concrete blocks? Modern concrete blocks are made of just that... concrete (sand, water, cement). Considerations for using concrete blocks:<br />* the ones that you buy will mostlikely not contain any chemicals or other things that are poisionious or dangerous to your health. I would advise not getting blocks from unknown sources.* are more expensive than wood. The total amount for the 56 blocks that I purchased was $84, before discounts and taxes* have a very long outdoor life regardless of what the weather or ground conditions are like<br />If you do not have the money for concrete blocks, then wood is an option. Considerations for using wood:<br />* wood is cheaper than concrete blocks. If you are looking to do gardening for the long term, the cheaper initial cost will be negated by the recurring replacement cost of the wood* use untreated wood. Treated wood contains chemicals that can be hazardous to your health if consumed.* the outdoor life of untreated wood is shorter than that of concrete. That means that if you live in an area with a lot of rainfall or high water table, that the wood will rot faster than average and therefore will need to be replaced sooner.<br /><br />**Step 3: Site Selection**<br />After you have purchased the items above, you need to select a flat or mostly flat spot in your yard.

"# Containers vs In Ground Gardening<br /><br />!(images/42625680_247595219445490_1775194796883580723_n.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />If you live in a small space container gardening works very great. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to doing container gardening or gardening in pots versus putting your fruits and vegetables directly into the ground. In this post I'm a cover those differences that I've experienced with my growing experiences.  <br /><br />So for the past several years I have been growing all of my purse and vegetables in containers instead of the putting them directly in the ground. However, I have noticed that my neighbor has majority of his plant directly in the ground or in raised beds. So after doing some years of research of just only planting in containers or pots these are some things that I've noticed about this process.<br /><br />**THE BENEFITS:**<br />Having your plant in a container versus directly in the ground allows you to better customize the soil to based upon the plant that is that particular container. For instance blueberries have a tendency to prefer more acidic soil versus less a tomato plants. That being said if you have a blueberry plant in just a specific container you can adjust the ratios of your soil so that it is acidic versus having an entire bed that has to be adaptable to a wide variety of everything that you put in that bed.<br /><br />Another benefit of planting in containers is that you can move the container or wherever you need to depending upon the time of year. For instance some plants require more sun song require more shade.  As the seasons change you can move the plant to a more shaded area if the plant actually needs more shade or move it to a more Sunny your area and if it needs more sun.<br /><br />Growing in containers actually can restrict the limit of how far the plants can grow out. For instance peppermint plants, is a very vine-like plant. That being said I planted a peppermint plant in a container of about two years ago and after about a year to a year-and-a-half, the peppermint plant had actually become almost root bound in that container.  In addition, the peppermint plant itself was actually trying to grow out of the container but it wasn't able to do so since the container was fairly high off the ground and it wasn't able to actually take root into the ground itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />**THE NEGATIVES:**<br />The major thing that I've noticed about container gardening is that the soil in the containers have a tendency to dry out faster during hotter weather. The reason is that the pot only can hold so much water and once that water start to evaporate it can't pull water from anywhere else. In my scenario from the last several years, I've actually had to make sure that I watered the container plants every day or every other day and depending upon the temperature and when the last time it rained. <br /><br />Another negative that exist with using containers or pots is that when the weather becomes very severe that the container can actually flip over depending on is dementia. I've used 5-gallon buckets and the five gallon buckets during severe weather in Alabama can lead up to winds in the 40 or more mile an hour range. With these high winds or higher winds, this can result in the plant being knocked over and dirt falling out as well as any reserve water being knocked out as well.<br /><br />This past winter, I noticed that the birds that were migrating through my area would land in the yard and go under the plants that were directly into the ground however they would not go into the ones that were in containers or pots. I'm not sure why that was the case, but it may have had something to do with the birds not being able to see what is in the pot before they go flying into it.  Now you may think that birds being able to get into a pot is very insignificant, but they actually play a major role in farming and gardening. In my experience has the birds actually eat the pests like ladybugs, caterpillars, and horn worms, just to name a few, that would normally attack the leaves on the plants that you are growing.<br /><br />With all this being said, this year I will be growing with a combination of in ground beds as well as containers and pots.  Hopefully this has given you a good perspective of the differences between growing in the ground versus growing in a container or a pot.

"# How to Start A Garden in 8 Steps<br /><br />!(images/20190409_180534.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />**How to Get started with a garden**<br />Spring... all that pollen lets us know that is here. I recently got asked by a high school classmate how I got started with my garden and any tips that I could provide them with to help them get started with hers. In addition, the big box stores are having their spring Black Friday sales. Which means plants andall things plant related,including dirt, tools, etc.are on sale right now. Check your local sales paper for the dates and the details. With the spring Black Friday sale, this is the perfect time for you to start your summer garden. Below I have outlined 8steps for you to get started.<br /><br />**STEP 1) DETERMINE A LOCATION**<br />The first step to get started with a garden is to determine where you are going to set up your garden in the amount of sunlight that that area gets in a day. If you intend on growingfruits and vegetables this season, then you will want to pick a spot that has mostly sun or is full sunthroughout the entire day. The reason is that most fruits and vegetables require a lot of energy to generate those fruits and vegetables that we enjoy, or hate if you are a kid.<br /><br />**STEP 2) CONTAINER GARDEN OR IN THE GROUND**<br />Once you have decided where you want to set up your garden, then you will need to determine whether you are doing a container garden or a garden in the ground or raised beds. I categorize in the ground and raised beds into the same category because they're both permanent fixtures that you set up. Container garden includes putting plants inside of a container, such as a 5 gallon (18.93 liters) bucket, a pot, an old trash can, or a drum. You get the idea. When I first started gardening, I gardened with only containers. This year I've expanded to gardening with raised beds using cinder blocks in addition to the containers I already have.<br /><br />**STEP 3) GARDENING TOOLS**<br />Next you'll want to purchase some gardening tools. You don't need any advanced tools for most of the work. At the very minimum, you want to have a shovel and<a href=""https://amzn.to/2WZS1VI"">gloves</a>. The size of the shovel will be determined by what type of garden you choose to set up. A container garden only needs to have a <a href=""https://amzn.to/2WZS0RE"">hand shovel</a> whereas a raised bed or in-ground garden needs to have a <a href=""https://amzn.to/2UPjlZ4"">full size shovel</a>. If you're setting up a raised bed or in-ground garden, I recommend that you also purchase <a href=""https://amzn.to/2X14HLJ"">a rake</a>. The rake will help you to level out the dirt and other materials that you are placing in your garden. <a href=""https://amzn.to/2WZS1VI"">Gardening gloves</a> will be used to protect your hands. However, if you have latex or other type of gloves those will do the job as well.<br /><br>**STEP 4) ALL DIRT IS NOT EQUAL**<br />Once you have decided on the type of garden that you want set up, then you will need to get the type of soil that corresponds to the type of garden that you're going to set up. I know what you are thinking...there are different types of soil? Yes there are two distinct types of soil that are sold at the big box stores. The first type of soil is called garden soil. Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used insometype of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them. Whereas the water that's in the ground can be drawn in by plant even if it's not directly underneath the plant or in the soil that the plant is in direct contact with.<br /><br />**STEP 5) SOIL AMENDMENTS**<br />The soil that you buy from the store can be used immediately. However, when I buy soil from the store, I always add some amendments to it to better the growth of my plants. Those amendments include Epsom salt, peat moss, and compost. For my plants, I use 1/3 of soil, 1/3 of peat moss, and 1/3 of compost. I use the ""it looks about right"" method when measuing out the materials. Howeverif you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added.<br />Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally donot come with soilor from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients. Organic matter is vital to the growth of the plant as the goal of having a healthy garden is to have a sustainable ecosystem.<br /><br />**STEP 6) FRUITS, VEGETABLES, OR FLOWERS**<br />Now that you have your soil you can decide on what type of plants that you want to put in the soil. When you go to purchase the plants that you want to Garden, be sure to look at the tag that comes with the plant. On the tag it will include how much sunlight that the plant needs in order to survive, The water requirements, and what the plant is. When I plant my fruits and vegetables, I usually leave the tag and next to where the plant is. That way in the future I know what the plant is that I'm looking at in a given location. If you happen to lose the tag that goes with a particular plant or a plant does not come with a tag, you can use a plastic butter knife next to the plant and write the name of the plant on the butter knife. Depending on the length of the growing season in the region that you are in, some Fruits and vegetables may not be possible to be grown in your area as it may not be warm enough for the correct amount of days.<br /><br />**STEP 7) JUST ADD WATER**<br />Plants, like any other living creature, need water. The guidelines that I follow regarding water formy outdoor plants is every other day during the hottest part of the season. During the cooler parts of the year, I usually water as needed. This needis determined based upon how dry the top inch to inch and a half of the soil is. If it rains on a given day during the hottest part of the season, I do not water my plants. The reason being is that you want the plants to be able to manage without going daily with water, in case you decide to go on vacation.<br /><br />**STEP 8) NOW THAT'S SOME GOOD EATING**<br />I know the section heading is not grammatically correct, but it does prove a point. Onceyour fruits or vegetables have reached their harvest date,then they are free to pick. How do you know what the harvest date is? The harvest date is written on the tag that comes with the plant. It is possible that the fruit or vegetable can be harvested prior or after the harvest date, but it's not advisable to do so as you want the plant to mature to the best of his ability. Do note that the harvest day is more of an advisory than an exact measurement. The conditions that the plant is in,such as the amount of sun, the amount of water, the health of the soil all play a factor into whether that harvest day is exact or not.<br /><br>**CONCLUSION**<br />Hopefully this has helped you to get prepared for your Spring Garden this year.

"# 7 Steps for More Steps<br /><br />!(images/20190509_075032.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />As research has frequently mentioned, one of the many keys to remaining healthy is to have an active lifestyle. One of the recommendations to achieve this is to walk at least 10,000 steps per day, which equates to about 5 miles. Make note that with this recommendation, that you do not have to get all 5 miles done in a single setting or activity.<br><br>The problem that I noticed was that I work a 9-5 desk job, and there’s really no walking involved for that line of work. After researching and hearing about the consequences of sitting or lack of walking, I decided to make some adjustments to my habits to get more steps in per day.<br><br>I have a phone and activity tracker that track the number of daily steps. On a typical day where I went from home to work to home without stopping anywhere else, I would log about 2,500 to 3,500 steps per day. That is way below the recommended 10,000 steps per day. So here’s how I chose to try to gain more steps per day without hitting the treadmill or park.<br><br><br>**HACK 1) PARK IN THE FIRST EMPTY SPOT**<br><br>If you really want some steps, park in the space that is closest to the road and not the store or restaurant that you are going into. Now personally I do not try to park at the door or ride around for finding the closest spot and I also do not park at the very end of the parking lot. Usually, I'll park in between the road and the store. The rule that I do follow is that I do not drive down more than two (2) aisles when looking for a parking space. Not only does riding around looking for the closest parking space waste gas, it also and reduce the number of steps that you get. This adds about 100-200 steps per occurrence.<br><br><br>**HACK 2) NO DRIVE-THRUS**<br><br>If I go out to eat and the restaurant has a drive through, I skip it and go inside to the counter. Through trail and error from doing this, I have found that by going inside instead of going into the drive-thru, I’m actually able to get in and out faster than those in the drive through. If you believe my experience is flawed, there is a survey that was done by QSR Magazine that stated that the drive-thru line wait time increased from 2013 to 2014 by 40 seconds. In addition, sitting in the drive through wastes gas unless you are driving an electric, hybrid, or auto-stop vehicle. Next time that you go to a fast-food restaurant, as you walk into the restaurant and take note of the last car that is in the drive through line and see if you walk out of the restaurant before the car gets out of the drive thru. This adds about 100-150 steps per occurrence.<br><br><br>**HACK 3) TAKE THE STAIRS**<br><br>If you have the option to take the stairs or the elevator, the default I recommend is to take the stairs. However, if there are no stairs then take the escalator and walk down it. Now if you work or live in a tall building and cannot take all the stairs to your floor, then go as many flights of steps that you can tolerate and take the elevator the rest of the way. This adds about 10-30 steps per floor.<br><br><br>**HACK 4) WHEN YOU GOTTA GO, GO FURTHER**<br><br>At my job, the restroom is about 20 steps from my desk. The next closest restroom in the office building is about 75 steps, including a flight of stairs (see Hack 3). Just by going to another floor, that’s almost 3 times the number of steps. Round trip, that is about 150 steps and traversing two flights of stairs. If your home has multiple stories with a bathroom on each, then when you have to use the bathroom, go to the bathroom on a floor that you are not on. If your home is single story, then go to the bathroom that is furthest from you or make multiple trips to and from where you are before you go. This adds about 110 steps at work and 40 at home each time that I go.<br /><br>**HACK 5) DRINK MORE WATER**<br><br>I know what you are thinking… water has nothing to do with steps. Actually it does though. By drinking more water, you will go to the bathroom more often. When you go to the bathroom more often, then you can apply Hack 4 to get more steps. Before using this hack, I would probably go to the restroom once, sometimes twice, while at work. Now that I drink more water, I go at least two or more times per day. Each time I go, I apply Hack 3 and 4.<br><br><br>**HACK 6) SET REMINDERS, PEDOMETER ALERTS**<br><br>I have a pedometer that I wear on my wrist. If it does not detect that I have taken any steps within the last hour, it will buzz and remind me to get some steps in. When it does go off and I am at work, I will get up to use the restroom (Hack 4), get some water (Hack 5), or talk to a coworker in person. If I am on a conference call when it goes off, I will stand up, stretch, and take some steps in my cubicle. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary.<br><br><br>**HACK 7) WALK AROUND YOUR CAR OR HOUSE BEFORE YOU GO IN**<br><br>One day, I was waiting at a red light located near a fire station. I noticed some of the firefighters went around to the back of the fire house on the right side. After about 15 seconds, some firefighters came from the back of the firehouse on the left side. However, it was not the group that had gone around on the right. About another 10 more seconds, the group I saw that went around on the right side was coming around on the left side and it occurred to me that they were doing laps. Firefighters cannot leave the firehouse while on shift, because they have to respond when a call comes in, they ran laps around the firehouse as their physical activity. Applying this same strategy, I will sometimes walk around by car before getting in it or walk around my house before going inside. During the walk around the car, I pay attention to the tires and look for any scratch marks or dings that may have appears. When walking around the house, I look at the roof and exterior to see if anything significant has changed. This adds about 25 steps when walking around the car and about 150 steps when walking around the house per occurrence. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary.<br><br>By doing a combination of these hacks, I've been able to increase my minimal step range from 2500-3500 range to the 4000-5000 range. I know you think that is not a lot, but keep in mind that every step counts. Hopefully, this has inspired you to take small steps in adding steps to your day. If you have additional steps (no pun intended) that you use to get more steps per day, add them in the comments below.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-05-09 06:00:00**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-05-12 13:22:27**<br /><br />";"2019.05.09-7-steps-for-more-steps.md"

"# 3 Benefits of Doing Something Different When Stuck<br /><br />!(images/blur-button-car-1827232.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />As some of you may know, I build automations as part of my day job. Sometimes, I do find myself getting stuck on building an automation. When it comes to programming, you can do an online search and find an example or the exact code for the thing that you are trying to program but cannot figure out how. However, there are times where the answer cannot be found on Stack Overflow. I know every programmer that is reading this probably had a facial reaction or yelled an expletive to the previous sentence, but it is true. I will admit, Stack Overflow does have a lot of the answers to the most common routine programming and computer questions, but there are still unknown unknowns that it does not have the answers to. <br /><br />In my younger programming days (you better not be laughing), I would keep trying different ways of accomplishing the programming task.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>This, continue working on it until you get it right approach, would work some of the time because I would become so focused on the program until I got it right.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Things have changed since then. New technologies have taken over (Python gasp). New programmers are not following the common standards or the specific language, like starting Java functions with an upper case letter, or just coming up with their own standards and wonder why other programmers do not want to touch what they have created. <br /><br />**ONE: YOU GET MORE WORK DONE **<br />With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>I put those JIRA tasks and the amount of time I spend on each task on my Outlook calendar, so that I can get a visual of how much time that I have spent on a given task in comparison to my week. By combining the visual from Outlook calendar and the Scrum Board from JIRA, I realized that I was completing fewer tasks in less time when I got stuck with a programming issue.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Those of you familiar with Burn Down Rates and how it can impact a project will probably understand this the best.<br />Staring at the round peg to see how you can get it in the square hole will not make the solution come by easier. If you know that you have other square pegs to place into square holes, then you can work on those and come back to the round peg and sqaure hole. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""></span>I have even completed lower priority tasks before higher priority tasks because I knew that I had or could reach the solution to that lower priority task faster than the higher priority task.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Some project managers may balk at this approach. If they do, my recommendation would be to reference your Burn Down Rate so that they see that you are completing more tasks, although it may not be the high priority ones. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""></span><br /><br />**TWO: THE NUMBERS FAVOR YOU**<br />The more that you are able to complete in given amount of time, the more valuable and productive that you appear.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>If your manager is only concerned with the numbers and not the science or reasoning behind the numbers, then this tip is great for you. Managers that only look at the numbers and not the data that supports the numbers think that things are going great because more tasks are getting completed.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>However, if you have 10 tasks that are to be completed within a sprint, and 5 of those are defects from crappy done work in a previous sprint, then you are really only completing 5 new items instead of 10, thus 50% new feature rate.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Solely looking at the numbers may not convey this point depending on how it is presented.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>If your manager actually wants to know the science or reasoning behind the numbers, this will probably get you on the Naughty List. When I work on an automation, I design it in a way so that unless something major changes (e.g. API changes, new elements on a page, conversion to new technology), that automation will work correctly and has the intelligence to handle minor issues that may occur. That way I’m truly completing the tasks assigned and not repeatedly patching defects or making small adjustments, thus reducing the number of new automations that I can complete. <br /><br />**THREE: LESS MENTAL FATIGUE AND STRAIN**<br />Since I was not so dedicated with completing one single task before moving on to the next, I realized that I was able to complete the work without being as mentally drained at the end of the day. Programming does not require much physical effort as most programmers either stand or sit in one spot while they do their work.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>However the ability to be able to assemble things in a logical fashion takes a lot of mental effort.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Combine that with not being able to complete a given task, in other words doing the same thing over and getting the same results, and you will have a high level of frustration and a low sense of accomplishment. <br /><br /><br />This article was written with programming and technology examples included. However do note that the main points can be applied to anything that you encounter.  For instance:<br />Cannot figure out why the tv will not turn on? Go listen to the radio. Later, check the power cord, surge protector if it is plugged into one, and replace the remote batteries.<br>Cannot figure out why the ice maker is not making ice? Go buy some ice. Later, check to see if the water line is connected and that it has power. Worse case by another fridge.<br>Cannot figure out why that person cut you off in traffic and did not use his or her turn signal? Let them go on down the road. Then pray for that driver’s bad habit be removed from them and continue on to your destination. <br /><br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-06-13 12:58:19**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-06-14 12:42:47**<br /><br />";"2019.06.13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck.md"
"# 7 Reasons I Can Do That Without The App<br /><br />!(images/Screenshot_2019-06-25-22-01-37.png)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />These days, everybody wants you to download their app. However, before installing an app, I ask myself whether I really do need the app. Every company's answer to this is ""Yes with sprinkles on the side"". Sometimes having an app does help you out to be more productive.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Other times, it is a waste of space and a way for the company to spy on you and your activities so that they can target you with ads.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>That being said, here are seven reasons why I am hesitant to install new apps. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""></span><br /><br />**REASON ONE: MOBILE FRIENDLY WEBSITE**<br />It is no secret that majority of the online traffic today comes from some sort of mobile device. As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websitesidentified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders. Which brings me to my next reason...<br /><br />**REASON TWO: LESS NOTIFICATIONS**<br />Today's society is constantly connected. Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level.<br /><br />**REASON THREE: PHONE SPACE**<br />Apps take up space. Some take up more than others. At last check, the Facebook app is over 150MB. Compare that to other apps, and that is a large application. To add to that, apps store data on your phone. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will cache some of the data on your phone that they have downloaded in the background. Over time, this cached data, if not removed, will slow down your phone and reduce your battery life. Meanwhile, I could be using that phone space to store videos, photos, music, audio books... you get the idea.<br /><br />**REASON FOUR: IT MAY BE OLD, BUT IT STILL WORKS**<br />When you do not rely on the app to be able to interact with a website or service, you can use an older phone. Periodically, Android raises the minimum version that apps have to comply with.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>Some app developers, mandate that you have an operating system that is no more than 3 versions behind the latest stable version available. About a year ago, I encountered this with the Southwest app. I have Android Lollipop on my phone. In an update, Southwest made the minimum version to Android Marshmallow, thus not allowing me to have the app on my phone. Southwest mobile website does everything that the app does, including displaying my boarding pass, so I started using that and uninstalled the app. Yes… I know that I could have went and got a new phone so that I could have continued to use the app.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>No… I could not justify the cost of getting a new phone for convenience of being able to check-in on a flight about 2 to 3 times per year. Besides if I had issues with the mobile website, Southwest lets you print boarding passes for free. <br /><br />**REASON FIVE: IOS VERSUS ANDROID APPEARANCE AND FEATURES**<br />If you are an Android person asking an iPhone user how to do something in an app, there is a 50/50 chance that the directions given will not work. Same goes for the other way around. Why is that? Well iPhone apps have to follow Apple standards in order to be listed in the App Store.Android apps do not have similar standards. In addition, some apps are built upon the features that are native to that operating system. Therefore, if one system interprets ""and"" as ""&amp;"" and the other interprets it as ""+"", then you will get two different outcomes for the same thing. This problem is not as big now as it was in the past thanks to programming languages such as Xamarin, which allow for code to be written once and be compatible for iOS and Android platforms.<br /><br />**REASON SIX: INFORMATION APPS ARE A WASTE**<br />In the past, I've done consultations for small businesses and startups and they claim that one of main things that they want to do as part of getting their business off the ground is to create an app. Some do have their preferences about getting aniOS app built before the Android app and vice versa, but that is not the point of this reason. When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this:<br />KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do?<br />CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services.<br />KENNY: Anything else beyond that?<br />CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app.<br />KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app createdis x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars.<br />CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find.<br />Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download anappbecause they want information about your business. That is what your website is for. People download apps because they want additional features that are not available via your website or to enhance the functionality of their phone. For instance, some people, myself included, have multiple email accounts. I would not download an email app that only supported one email account. While it is true that I could have all of my email forwarded to a single account, I have multiple accounts because each account has a designated purpose. I do not want my ""daily coupon and specials"" emails be merged in with my ""new billing statement available"" emails.<br /><br />**REASON SEVEN: THE APP IS A FANCY WEB BROWSER**<br />Try this... go to your app and take a note of its appearance. Then go to the website (or mobile website) that is associated with that app. If the app and the mobile website look the same, there is a 99.999999994% (yes that last 4 is significant) chance that the app that you have is just a web browser that only allows you to access that company's website. That's right... there are companies that are building mobile friendly websites and then building apps that only navigate to that mobile friendly website. I am not going to mention their names, but some financial institutions that I have done business with have done this in the past. In addition, I did some contract work for a service provider. That service provider wascharging about $1,000 for the mobile app. All they were doing were changing the default URL in the app,installing a WordPress plugin so that the page would render as being mobile friendly, and publishing it to the App or Play Store. All of thattook about a 1 hour to complete. <br /><br />While these strategies may not work for you, I find my phone to be less of a maintenance annoyance and pain point for keeping updated since I am using fewer apps. It is true that ""There's an app for that"". With that in mind, I challenge you to think of whether you really need that app before installing it. <br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-06-16 22:54:13**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-06-26 20:31:39**<br /><br />";"2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app.md"
"# Markdown My Words<br /><br />!(images/Presentation1.png)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />When it comes to blogging, each blogger has his or her preferences in regards to the CMS (Content Management System) to use and his or her process for creating content. One of the things that I have done is to start writing more blog posts and documents in Markdown instead of using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. <br /><br />**REASON 1: CONVERTS TO OTHER PLATFORMS**<br /><br />Markdown is used by several other platforms.  One of the most noted platforms that uses Markdown is Github Pages. When using WYSIWYG, it allows you to make well formatted documents using a plain text editor, but allows you to convert them to another editor so that it looks like you typed them in a word processor (like MS Word).  Why is this useful?  <br /><br />**REASON 2: ALLOWS YOU TO TYPE FASTER**<br /><br />For me, markdown allows me to type faster.  I'm able to type two asterisks (**) faster than I am able to shift my hands to be able to process Ctrl+B for bolding text. In addition, you do not have to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse to click the corresponding icon for the text modification that you are trying to perform. <br /><br />**REASON 3: NO NEED FOR WYSIWYG**<br /><br />Many bloggers use WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors when writing their content on their website.  The problem those editors, is that they add a bunch of extra HTML formatting such as paragraph, span, and div tags.  Some add special characters in their paragraphs as a way to make those formatting changes. Then if you change the appearance of the website, the content of the page also changes.  In the worst case, it changes uncontrollably because of the new styling (CSS) that you have in place.  By using markdown, the extra formatting is not added in the field of the post. <br /><br />I have decided that using Markdown is the way to go.  Now sometimes, I will still have to use the older way of doing things, like when editing a document in Microsoft Word. <br /><br />These are just my thoughts.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-07-23 12:30:38**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-07-23 12:32:09**<br /><br />";"2019.07.23-markdown-my-words.md"
"# Squirrels Taught Me About Women and Food<br /><br />!(images/65887135-3254981701240750-4923646209148583936-n-1562075980.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />***DISCLAIMER:** I am not equating a squirrel to a woman. That is not a fair, nor equal comparison by no means. The comparisons mentioned below are for the sake of illustration and for laughter.*<br /><br />I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media.  A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant. Before this image went viral, I found a way to save that additional $4 on food that I'm not even going to eat. Believe it or not, what I am about to share with you, I learned it from gardening.  Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it.  Now gentlemen, these steps will only work if you have a greater and diverse taste pallet than your lady. Do not be afraid to become diverse when it comes to food. So here's how I keep a woman from eating off my plate...<br /><br />**STEP 1: LEARN WHAT SHE DOES NOT EAT OR IS ALLERGIC TO**<br /><br />The first year I got serious about gardening, I planted a combination of fruits and vegetables that I wanted to eat during the growing season.  This resulted in me caring for bunch of green leaves and no fruit. Talking about disappointment... it was major.   So after doing some research about squirrels, I found that their diet consists of mostly of nuts and small fruit. I had to make a choice... grow the food that squirrels and I both love so much and fight them to eat it, or grow something that I love and that the squirrels hate. Since I'm responsible for maintaining the garden, growing what the squirrels did not eat became the priority. In the end, I did not have to protect my garden with Fort Knox security because they were not attracted to what was in the garden. <br /><br />To apply this step to women, find out what she does not eat or is allergic to. There are several ways that you can figure this out. <br /><br />1. **Just ask.** She may tell you everything. She may tell you only part of the list. Whatever she tells you, be sure to make note of it. <br />2. **Check the pantry.** That's right... go in her pantry or cabinets. You have to decide whether you want to be discrete about it or not. If you do not see beans in her cabinet, that's probably on the Do Not Eat List. <br />3. **Watch what she eats.** If y'all go to a restaurant that is known for burgers, and she orders chicken, then there is a great chance that she does not eat beef. If she orders French Fries with Ranch, then she probably does not eat ketchup. If she orders the vegan shrimp tacos, then she probably does not eat actual meat. If she always orders Papa Johns', then you order Domino's or Pizza Hut.<br /><br />**STEP 2: WHEN EATING, ORDER THE ITEMS YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED FROM STEP 1**<br /><br />With my knowledge of the squirrel diet, I revamped my garden to include jalapeno peppers, lettuce, and turnip greens. After planting these items, I rarely saw a squirrel near the garden or in the yard. Why? They weren't attracted to what was there.  Thus staying away and looking else where. <br /><br />Now there are times where Step 2 may not fully work. That's when you still order what you want, but modify it accordingly. For instance...<br /><br />1. You like chicken, your lady likes chicken, and your lady hates BBQ sauce. Pour BBQ sauce on the chicken. Problem solved.  <br />2. You order a salad, your lady likes salads, your lady also likes Ranch dressing, but your lady does not eat Ranch dressing on her salad. Order a salad with Ranch dressing... and coat it thoroughly. Problem solved.<br />3. You go to a seafood restaurant, your lady likes shrimp and does not like spicy food. Order shrimp and cover it with hot sauce. Problem solved.<br /><br />**STEP 3: CHECK THE REACTION**<br /><br />When squirrels are scouting the area, they will look and stand on their hind legs or climb a tree to get a better field of view. When they cannot find what they think they saw, they continue digging and looking and digging and looking. Eventually they will give up and look elsewhere for food. <br /><br />Before a woman swipes... I mean steals food off of your plate, she will do an analysis of what you have on your plate with or without your prior knowledge. Think of it like Robocop walking down the street and he is analyzing each person's face to see if he or she is the individual matching a suspects description. Instead of faces being scanned, it is the food on your plate.<br /><br />* Scanning baked beans... will cause gas... skipping. <br />* Scanning potato salad... does not have boiled eggs... skipping. <br />* Scanning mac and cheese... it has raisins in it... skipping. <br />* Scanning chicken wings... confirming it has lemon pepper seasoning... TAKE IT, TAKE IT. <br /><br />Now if she scans your entire plate and does not find anything that appeals to her taste buds, she will make a comment about that fact. You may hear one or more of the following phrases accompanied with an unpleasant facial expression: <br /><br />* ""I don't see how you eat that stuff.""<br />* ""I don't need none of that.""<br />* ""You know eating *insert food name* is not good for you."" <br /><br />If you hear any of the preceding phrases or something similar, you sir have successfully saved your food from being stolen. <br /><br />Ladies, you have to understand that there is nothing more satisfying to a man than to be able to order what he wants and knowing that he will be able to clean the entire plate. When a lady eats from a man's plate, he will not get full because of the fact she has reduced the portion size.  Thus he has to venture to the kitchen or some other place for a midnight snack because he was deprived of calories. As previously mentioned, these steps can only be achieved if you have a greater diversity in your taste pallet than your lady. Lacking this essential trait, means that you will never be successful eating your entire plate if she is around. These are just my thoughts.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-07-03 11:49:56**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-07-03 16:16:16**<br /><br />";"2019.07.03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food.md"
"# When Deploying Before Testing<br /><br />!(images/503.jpg)<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />As you may know, on July 3, 2019, Facebook, Instagram, Down Detector, and a number of other websites were partially or fully unavailable. Cloudflare mentioned did admit that the outage was their fault and did rectify the situation.  However, it was not resolved until a number of users complained and reported images not loading.  <br /><br />Cloudflare provides CDN services.  CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.  Content Delivery Networks are often used by high traffic websites to be able to provide you with images, video, and other online resources faster as they are located closer to where you are. <br /><br />For instance, let’s say a company has their primary data center in Utah, it may take about 5 seconds for an online image request to be sent and response to be returned to a device that is on the East Coast.  However with a CDN, the image that is on the Utah server, is copied to a server in Virginia. Then when the request for that same image is made from the device on the East Coast, the image is provided from the Virginia server instead of the Utah server in about 1 or 2 seconds. This is part of the reason why it is said that if you upload and image or other content online, that you will never be able to delete it. <br /><br />**TESTING ENVIRONMENT**<br /><br />When I primarily did IT support, we were often asked to do changes that were to be deployed in the testing environment first. Not only this, but we had to provide proof that the change being implemented in the testing environment  was successful and did not destroy the testing environment before performing the change in the production environment. <br /><br />There is one major difference between the testing environment and the production environment.  That is that the testing environment may get about 5% of the activity that the production environment gets unless a simulation is performed.  Long story short, this change may have been tested in the testing environment and the CPU spike did not occur or was not noticeable to be classified as a failure.  <br /><br />This change was probably not well tested or tested at all in a lower environment. A *lower environment* is supposed to be an exact copy of the production environment.  In the lower environment, you can play around or try things out without breaking the production environment. <br /><br />**USE AN AUTOMATION OR SCRIPT**<br /><br />When using an automation or script to perform work, the change is less likely to be error prone. The reason being, is that most automations are tested a number of times before being rolled out.  Once rolled out, they are guaranteed to work unless an unexpected situation occurs. For instance, a software dependency is not installed, thus the automation is not able to configure the software.  In this circumstance, the automation should fail and roll back what activities that it has done thus far. <br /><br />**WORK IN BATCHES** <br /><br />It was mentioned that they noticed that the CPU usage had spiked on the primary and secondary servers. Assuming that the changes were applied at the same time, indicates a bigger problem.  From my support experience, we would not deploy or make changes to all the servers at the same. What we would do is deploy to some of the servers and then deploy to the remaining servers after confirming all is well.  <br /><br />For instance, some of the applications that I have supported had 4 application servers. We would deploy to 2 of the servers first.  If the deployment went well and post-regression testing passes, then we would deploy to the remaining 2 servers. By doing things this way, it does take longer to complete the deployment.  However, it ensures that you do not introduce a major failure or issue into your production environment and impact your customers.  If they had deployed to the primary instances and saw that CPU spike that was mentioned, then they could have rolled back after identifying that the <br /><br />**CONCLUSION**<br /><br />When it comes to code deployment and IT infrastructure changes, this can be a lesson that we can all learn from this. <br /><br />1) Test your code in the lower environment<br />2) Simulate conditions that would be encountered in the production environment as much as possible when testing.  This will give you an accurate representation of what would happen under normal use.<br />3) Do not deploy the change to all of the servers in a single environment at the same time <br />4) After deploying the change, be sure to confirm that everything is working as it should be. Any unexpected behaviors that result after the change should be an immediate cause for alarm and the change backed out.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-07-04 13:48:34**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-07-04 13:52:45**<br /><br />";"2019.07.04-when-deploying-before-testing.md"
"# 21 Days for a New Habit<br /><br />**Engineer Level: Amateur (Beginner)**<br /><br />They say that it takes 21 days to learn a new habit and to break old ones. Therefore, I took 28 days to see what would happen. Was I trying to overachieve by doing more than what was necessary? Nah. Initially, it was going to be 21 Days of Prayer that my church. It was coincidence that part of the 21 Days of Prayer was overlapped by the 21 Days of Miraculous Meditation done by Deepak Chopra.  Combine this with the dating/relationship issues that I had and the certification course that was about to start for the next 4 weeks and it was almost like I walking into a season of turmoil.  <br /><br />So what habits did I choose to do for this season that I saw myself entering? I have about 15-20 items on the habits list.  I am not going to cover them all and the impact that they had as this post would be unreasonably long. <br /><br />## HABIT 1: RIDE WITH THE RADIO OFF <br />Not the volume turned all the way down, but I actually pressed the power button and turned it off. In order to not make things awkward when I had passengers, I did turn the radio on while they were riding. Once they got out, radio went back off. <br /><br />1)  **You may more attention to what is going on around you while you drive.** You would not believe how many folks drive with their cell phones in their hand. Well you probably do. One thing that I did notice, is that a lot of the drivers that I saw with phones in their hand(s), had damage to their right front bumper and headlight area. From watching *Canada's Worst Driver*, they stated that a lot of drivers usually hit something on the passenger side more than the driver side. Makes sense as most drivers would not put themselves in danger when they have full control. In addition, most people drift to the right in their lane instead of the left as drifting left will put you into oncoming traffic on rural and residential roads.<br /><br />2) **You can think without being interrupted.** When your song gets played on the radio, you know the one that I am talking about that makes you turn the radio up on blast and have a one band choir, it distracts you from what you were previously thinking about or interrupts the conversation that you were having with your passengers. Traffic report comes on, you focus on what is being said to make sure there are no accidents in the direction that you are headed. With the radio off, you can figure out that programming problem, replay a conversation back and figure out why you said what you said, or if you believe in an higher power to pray. <br /><br />## HABIT 2: MEAT ONCE PER DAY MAXIMUM<br />I know you are saying that that is impossible to do. It actually is very possible to do. The habit with this is that I could eat as much meat as I wanted, but it had to be consumed within a single meal or snack. Depending on where you live, it may be harder to do in some places than others.  Where I live, there are not many vegan or vegetarian only restaurants, but there are restaurants that do offer vegan and vegetarian options.  One side effect was that my bathroom habits changed. I realized that meat slows down my digestion, so when I would eat a large amount of meat, I would not “go” as often.  For me, it involved a lot of thinking ahead about what I was going to eat. It also involved taking a lunch everyday… yes single day… instead of going out for lunch. Some days, that meant I ate a big bowl of oatmeal for lunch as I didn’t cook dinner the night before.<br /><br />##HABIT 3: PACK A LUNCH<br />During the month of August, I had many expenses come up. Vehicle registration, having tress cut, new car battery after the previous gave out unexpectedly, home repairs… it was a lot. I calculated the amount that I had spent on going out to eat during the month of July. It totaled to about $75 or the equivalent of 1.5 tanks of gas. When I started looking more intently at the non-essential things that  I was spending my money on and converting that to the financial equivalent of the essentials that I was spending my money on, it put things into a greater perspective financially that I was really living at my means. So by cutting back on takeout and going out to eat, I was able to divert those funds to things that would bring me a greater sense of accomplishment, like doing handy work or my own car repairs or making financial investments with the savings. <br /><br />## HABIT 4: WORK IT OUT<br />One of the ways to reduce stress is to work out. So I made a commitment to myself to do Focus T25 or Wii Sports a couple of times per week. Now I did not follow the T25 workout plan as it was designed given that I did not have the time to be able to do so.  My strategy was that some workout is better than no workout. Was I sore the first week of consistently doing Wii and T25? Yes. Almost to the point that I would rather sit or laydown than stand up. Did I feel a change in my body and level of energy?  Yup. <br /><br />## CONCLUSION<br />Now I am not saying that what I have done will work for you. Everybody is different and has their own way of dealing with the complexities of life.  That said, consider this post as a guide for what you can do for your 21+ day habit changing, fasting or prayer. <br /><br />These are just my thoughts. <br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-08-15 22:40:33**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-08-15 22:50:01**<br /><br />";"2019.08.15-21-days-for-a-new-habit.md"
"# About<br /><br />!(images/public://SAM_2423-f008473.png)<br /><br /><br />**REASONS WHY I BLOG**<br />Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching presentation that stated that every software developer should have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded. Fast forward to 2018, Kennyattended a gardening workshop that mentioned that every gardener should have a journal. It eventually occurred to him that hecould start blogging about hisgardening successes and failures and use that as his gardening journal.<br />Kenny'sday job is working as an IT professional. He hasyears of experience in building web based applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living, often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for that code snippet and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for.<br />Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After having some seasons of little success and being able to literately taste the fruits of my labor, Kennydecided to expand his greenthumb skill set. Thanks to social media, Kennyfound other that some friends and former classmates also had an interest in gardening and they were looking for help. After attending a class at a local urban farm about gardening, it occurred to him that a blog could be used as a journal to track my successes and failures.<br />Since then, he hasbeen blogging hisgardening and technology experiences and mishaps for several reasons: 1) you learn from your past mistakes 2) others can learn from your mistakes before they make them 3) you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going.<br /><br />**""THE ALMOST ENGINEER"" EXPLAINATION**<br />If you have read this far down the page, you probably are wondering how did Kennycome up with The Almost Engineer name. Kennyworks (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field of Computer Science, has greatproblem solving skills, and enjoys fixing thingsinstead of paying someone else to do it for him. However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) instead ofan engineering degree, thus *almost* being an engineer.<br /><br />**GARDENING INFORMATION**<br />Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located in the southeastern United States.

"# How To: Synchronize files between two or more Windows computers<br /><br />Do you have two or more computers running Windows?  If you do, do you hate having to backup or keep files synchronized on both computers?  Well we have a solution for you.<br /><br />I know what you’re thinking: I can use Google Drive (formerly Google Docs) or DropBox or SkyDrive or some other online file storage service and just download it from there when I need it.<br /><br />While that’s true, but everyone has files that they want to keep classified and off the internet.<br /><br />So how do you sync files on your Windows computer the easy way.  Use SyncToy!  SyncToy is from Microsoft.  The features it has includes: allows you to sync the files on two or more computers with a central computer over your wired or wireless network, allows you to exclude files, and allow you overwrite files in an existing location.  It works with Windows XP or later and has a 32 and 64-bit versions.  If you use the sync feature, it will compare the files in directories on both computers.  When a difference is detected it will update the computer that contains the older version of the file or that does not have the file.  Best of all, it’s free to download and use!<br /><br />Some members of the BBIT team have been using SyncToy to keep the files between their laptop and desktop synced and to have backup copies of their documents, music, etc in case one computer were to crash or be stolen.  It has been stated that it could have more functionality, but it does get the job done.  If you have a lot of files or large files (i.e. videos, movies, etc), we would recommend that you do the syncing overnight or when you aren’t in the office.<br /><br />If you would like to download SyncToy, go to the download page located at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155.<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-06-28 08:46:27**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 23:33:47**<br /><br />";"2015.06.28-how-to-synchronize-files-between-two-or-more-windows-computers.md"

"# Installing Drupal 7 on 1 and 1 Web Hosting<br /><br />Unless you use the ""click to build"" tool that is provided by 1 and 1, Drupal 7 requires some knowledge to set up on their servers.  Some developers prefer not to use the click to build version, because it limits which modules and themes that you may use.  Also, you cannot update the website when a new Drupal version is released, but instead have to wait until 1 and 1 updates the Drupal core to the most recent version. <br /><br />If you are like most professional developers, you create websites in a development environment and then move them over to a production or live environment. However, most developers do not have their development environment configured the same way as 1  and 1's web hosted environment. This guide is to show you how to install your Drupal 7 website on 1 and 1.<br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />* 1 and 1 web hosting package that has PHP and MySQL database support. *Don't have a 1 and 1 hosting package, then <a href=""http://www.1and1.com/?affiliate_id=339564"">get one now</a>.*<br />* A Drupal website that you have created in your development/test environment.<br /><br /><br /><br />The process<br /><br />* If you have not done so already, create a new database account (Control Panel &gt; MySQL Administration) on 1 and 1. <br /><br /><br /><br />* Do not close this window. You will need the information that is provided later in the process.<br />* After you have entered the account information, 1 and 1 will provide you with the login credentials for the database. <br />* Creating the account takes some time (approximately 5 to 10 minutes). The database creation status is displayed on the database dashboard. <br /><br /><br /><br />* If you have not done so already, create an FTP account.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Do not close this window. You will need the information that is provided later in the process.<br />* Creating the account takes some time (approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The status is displayed on the FTP dashboard.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Put your Drupal site into Maintenance Mode (Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Maintenance) and then log out.<br />* Open the .htaccess file in the Drupal root folder and add ""AddType x-mapp-php5 .php"" to the top of the file. <br />* In the .htaccess file, uncomment ""# RewriteBase /"" line to support Clean URLs. Save the file.<br />* Open the settings.php file (located in your Drupal installation at sites/default/settings.php) and add the database information that 1 and 1 has provided you in step 1.  Save the file.<br />* Export the database of your Drupal installation from your development environment to a SQL file. <br /><br /><br /><br />* If the file is really large (2MB or more), clear Drupal's cache before exporting. This will reduce the file size and the number of queries that will have to be ran.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Check the status of the database account that you have created. If the status is ""Ready"", click the PHPMyAdmin link to view the database. <br />* On the left, click the name of the database that you set up to use for Drupal. <br />* Click the ""SQL"" tab.<br />* Below the text box is option to upload a SQL file to the server. Add the SQL file that you exported from your development database and click the corresponding ""Go"" button. <br />* After it has completed, you should see a database structure that resembles that of your development environment.<br />* Login to your FTP account using a FTP client (i.e. FileZilla) with the information provided in step 2... <br />* Browse to the root folder of your domain. <br />* Transfer your Drupal installation from your development environment to 1 and 1 in binary mode. <br />* Change the file permissions to 0755.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you followed these steps correctly, you should now be able to view your website via your website's URL. <br />Notes: <br /><br />* If your website appears to be missing CSS styling and/or images aren't loading, login into website on 1 and 1 (i.e. example.com/user) and clear Drupal's cache (Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Performance &gt; Clear all caches).<br /><br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2015-06-28 08:48:45**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 23:33:47**<br /><br />";"2015.06.28-installing-drupal-7-on-1-and-1-web-hosting.md"

"# Installing Drupal 7 on 1and1 servers<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You will need a 1and1 hosted package that supports PHP 5.2+ and MySQL 5.xx to run Drupal 7<br /><br />1- Download Drupal 7.xx<br /><br />2- Uncompress Drupal<br /><br />3- Create your site's config folder in the sites/ directory.

This should be the path of your resulting config file:<br />drupal/sites/mysite.com/settings.php<br />duplicated from<br />drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php<br /><br />4- To use PHP5 to parse .php files add this line to the top of your .htaccess file:<br />AddType x-mapp-php5 .php<br /><br />5- To add Clean URL support uncomment this line in your .htaccess file:<br /># RewriteBase /<br /><br />6- FTP the installation files to your 1and1 server in binary mode, use permissions 0755<br /><br />8- Go to your 1and1 control panel and under Domains point your domain to your Drupal installation.

"# Automatically creating new menu items Drupal 7<br /><br />### <br /><br />### <br />Menu breadcrumbs<br />Drupal breadcrumbs implementation is a never-ending source of <br />frustration for many website developers. A few modules exist which more <br />or less successfully attempt to get Drupal to display meaningful <br />breadcrumbs on every page.<br /><br /><br />One of these modules is <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/menu_breadcrumb"">menu_breadcrumb</a>, which displays the breadcrumb trail based on current node's menu path. Very useful and sufficient in most use cases.<br /><br /><br />### <br />Limitations and automatic menu modules<br />The only problem with *menu_breadcrumb* is when you're not happy to grant users the *administer menu* permission to create and assign menu items for the content they create.<br /><br /><br />Several Drupal modules exist which work around the permission <br />restriction and automatically create menu items for newly created <br />content nodes. To name a few, <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/automenu"">Auto Menu</a> and <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/automaticmenu"">Automatic Menu</a>, both of which are either only available for Drupal 5.x, or their Drupal 6.x implementation is still in beta development stage.<br /><br /><br />### <br />Rules and Drupal API<br />Fortunately, a quick and easy way to create menu items <br />programmatically doesn't even require a standalone module. All we're <br />going to need is the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/rules"">Rules</a> module and a bit of Drupal API knowledge.<br /><br /><br />The Rules set of modules allows site administrators to define <br />conditionally executed actions, such as arbitrary PHP code execution, <br />based on occurring events, such as node creation. For the Drupal API <br />part, we'll use a single function <a href=""http://api.drupal.org/api/function/menu_link_save"">menu_link_save</a>.<br /><br /><br />*menu_link_save* requires an item configuration parameter, whose key names mirror the column names of Drupal's *menu_links* database table.<br /><br /><br />### <br />The solution<br />As mentioned above, we're going to use the *Rules* module. <br />It's installation is pretty straightforward and requires no additional <br />configuration. Let's move right to the setting up our rule.<br /><br /><br />Say we want to create a menu item under *Primary Links* menu's *Blog* item every time a new node of type *Story* is created.<br /><br /><br />Navigate your browser to *Administer » Rules » Triggered rules* page, add a new rule and configure it along the lines of the image:<br /><br /><br /><img alt=""Screen-shot of Drupal Rules' configuration screen of a rule which would execute custom PHP code at each creation of a node of type Story"" src=""http://jan.tomka.name/sites/default/files/rules_auto_menu.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br />Finally, we're getting to the PHP snippet itself, which we'll use to <br />automatically create a new menu item every time this rule is triggered. <br />Click *Execute custom PHP code* and insert the following fragment of code:<br /><br /><br /><div class=""geshifilter""><br /><pre class=""drupal6 geshifilter-drupal6""><span class=""re0"">$item</span> = <a href=""http://www.php.net/array""><span class=""kw3"">array</span></a><span class=""br0"">(</span><br /> <span class=""st0"">'link_path'</span> =<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span> <span class=""st0"">'node/'</span> . <span class=""re0"">$node</span>-<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span><span class=""me1"">nid</span>,<br /> <span class=""st0"">'link_title'</span> =<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span> <span class=""re0"">$node</span>-<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span><span class=""me1"">title</span>,<br /> <span class=""st0"">'plid'</span> =<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span> <span class=""nu0"">426</span>,<br /> <span class=""st0"">'hidden'</span> =<span class=""sy0"">&gt;</span> <span class=""nu0"">1</span><br /><span class=""br0"">)</span>;<br /><a href=""http://api.drupal.org/api/function/menu_link_save/6""><span class=""kw5"">menu_link_save</span></a><span class=""br0"">(</span><span class=""re0"">$item</span><span class=""br0"">)</span>;```<br /><br /><br />Just a few remarks on otherwise pretty simple piece of code.<br /><br /><br /><br />* *menu_link_save* function will only accept normalized path as<br />a link path. When using anything nontrivial for the path, such as the <br />loaded node's *path* property, always use drupal_get_normal_path()  to normalize its value!<br />* *menu_name* is the the machine-readable name of the menu. You can get that from *Administer » Site building » Menus* page as the last component of the menu customization URL.<br />* Value of *plid* is the menu link id of the item you want your<br />item to be a child of. Again, easy to find out, just navigate your <br />browser to the menu's *List items* page and figure out the menu link id of each menu item from its *edit* link URL.<br />* It's up to you whether you want the menu item hidden or displayed by<br />default. I'm using the automatically created menu items just to give *menu_breadcrumb*<br />a when putting together the current page's breadcrumb trail. I don't <br />want the menu items to be visible to the users, that's why i set the *hidden* value to 1.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Source: http://jan.tomka.name/blog/programmatically-creating-menu-items-drupal<br /><br />**Posted: 2015-10-30 20:36:38**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-08 20:10:05**<br /><br />";"2015.10.30-automatically-creating-new-menu-items-drupal-7.md"

"# Find lines that contain greater than specified number of characters in Unix<br /><br />When working with files in Unix, sometimes you need to find the files that are greater than a specified number of characters.  Unix systems are often used as servers for applications in the corporate and enterprise.  Some system interfaces require that files with data be sent from one server to another for processing.  As a result, some files could be improperly formatted or could contain bad data which requires manual intervention.  <br /><br />```<br />awk 'length $(0)'>42  datafile.dat<br />```<br /><br /><br />In the command above, awk is the program used.   <br /><br /><br />* ""$(0)"" says to pull the entire line.<br />* ""42"" is the number that you are filtering on.

"# 1 Year Review of Liftmaster 8500 with MyQ Internet Gateway<br /><br />!(images/public://field/image/SAM_2052.JPG)<br /><br />One year ago, i installed this Liftmaster 8500 garage door opener. Bought it online and installed it myself within a weekend. The kit that i purchased came with the MyQ Internet gateway. <br /><br /><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ON0NbQmCXeo"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The pros <br /><br />It is very quiet. If i open the door while standing on the other side of the house, i barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving. Take a listen<br /><br />The opener was very easy to install.  If you already have a garage door installed, adding this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall.<br /><br />The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there. <br /><br />This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if i chose to change my mind in the future. <br /><br />It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers. <br /><br />In my garage, i have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch. <br /><br />The cons <br /><br />Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on. <br /><br />I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem. <br /><br />Number two <br /><br />If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home.<br /><br />For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this. <br />I did check the MyQ message board and saw that others have complained about this and a Liftmaster representative responded. However Liftmaster hasn't provide an update to this defect. <br /><br />The MyQ app doesn't always close the door back immediately after it has opened. <br /><br />With my android phone, if i press the button on my phone to close the door within 20 seconds of it being opened, the door doesn't close. <br /><br />However if i force close the app, reopen it, and then press the button to close the door, the door proceeds to close. This is another complaint that i have seen on the MyQ message board. <br /><br />Overall it is a great garage door opener in my opinion.  However it does have room for improvement, especially in regards to the app.<br /><br />**Posted: 2018-01-20 15:20:33**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-04-30 21:43:06**<br /><br />";"2018.01.20-1-year-review-of-liftmaster-8500-with-myq-internet-gateway.md"

"# Greens From the Winter Garden<br /><br />!(images/public://field/image/20190228_071422_0.jpg)<br /><br />As we enter March, it's almost time to prepare for the summer garden. **However**, Mother Nature decided to throw a curve ball with an unexpected frost after severe weather. I did see a post on social media about the groundhog got the weather forecast wrong. This is not surprising. What sense does it make to take weather advice from a cousin of a rodent? I'm just saying. Back to the subject at hand... the winter garden is still producing ready to eat food. This is a picture of a mustard green that I pulled from the garden. As you can see it is as long as my arm, which is over two feet in length. There were multiple leaves on the stalk like this one. In total, I picked about 2 pounds of greens and still didn't make a dent in the on hand supply. I think part of the reason for the greens being able to grow so large is due to the large amounts of rain that have taken place in recent weeks. Also being able to control the snails, catepillar worms, and other pests that feed on them with a mixture of salt and flour has helped. Without this occasional pest control, they would devour the leaves resulting in holes or entire leaves missing. This week's weather has multiple frosty nights in the forecast. This is contrary to the severe weather and tornadoes that were experienced during the previous weekend. The frost will continue to control any pests that did start to set up shop on the leaves, especially the snails.<br /><br /><br />**Posted: 2019-03-04 21:42:16**<br /><br />**Updated: 2019-03-10 23:47:57**<br /><br />";"2019.03.04-greens-from-the-winter-garden.md"
