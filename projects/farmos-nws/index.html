 { "title": "FarmOS NWS (2017)", "description": "", "keywords": "", "author": "", "content": "The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source. Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.
