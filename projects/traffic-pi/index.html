Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. For example, most future engineers are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate future engineers about the impact that computers and computer programming has with society. This project targets the "T, E, and M" of "STEM" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions.</p> <p>One of the goals of this project is to be able to teach the next generation of engineers about the programming, software versioning, and how valuable engineers and technologists are to society and the impact that they have. A game was developed to be combined with this project to teach about software versioning, how sometimes Software Developers don't get it right the first time, and the negative impact that can occur if they don't get it right the first time.</p> <p>Below is the image of a group of future engineers working their way to developing the psuedocode for a normal traffic cycle. As shown in the first version, all of the lights turned on but never turned off. In the final version, they figured out that they had to turn on and turn off each light as well as include a delay in between each light change.</p> <p><img alt="Image of Versioning" src=/images/versioning.jpg></p> <h2 id=technology>Technology</h2> <p>Below are the list of parts used for this project. You'll need to choose one of the mentioned options below depending on your budget. Using LEDs is cheaper than getting an actual traffic light.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BC7BMHY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07BC7BMHY&linkId=b51d201ecdca3bed2a84249448d0dd4f" target=_blank>Raspiberry Pi</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GYKNCCP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08GYKNCCP&linkId=1e440b7afda77da0a25f2af4d65b8b6a" target=_blank>Micro SD card</a> (to run the OS and store project files)</li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQVB3HQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07RQVB3HQ&linkId=8452f5455a39f35597424dcc8a2ae388" target=_blank>USB keyboard</a> (mouse optional)</li> <li>HDMI display</li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD25V8D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07GD25V8D&linkId=ea5fb3393909abe778b518e808e674d5" target=_blank>Breadboard Jumper Cables</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PCJP9DY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PCJP9DY&linkId=dca65d5d374944f5c1d213924d2fb183" target=_blank>Breadboard</a> (optional)</li> <li>.NET 5</li> <li>Raspberry Pi OS (has been tested with Raspberry Pi OS Jessie)</li> </ul> <h3 id=led-option>LED Option</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPV4CSH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XPV4CSH&linkId=ab8747a23cf5b35f3e83190c54cacd36" target=_blank>Red LED</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPV4CSH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XPV4CSH&linkId=ab8747a23cf5b35f3e83190c54cacd36" target=_blank>Yellow LED</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPV4CSH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XPV4CSH&linkId=ab8747a23cf5b35f3e83190c54cacd36" target=_blank>Green LED</a></li> </ul> <h3 id=real-traffic-light-option>Real Traffic Light Option</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KTEN3TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rhtservicesll-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KTEN3TM&linkId=581b0fc60dcc9f3ddc5645b8eb20029a" target=_blank>Relay board(s) with at least 3 channels</a></li> <li>Traffic Light</li> </ul> <h2 id=video-demonstration>Video Demonstration</h2> <p>Video demonstration of version 1.0 of the project is available to be watched at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_ZJNX0viM" target=_blank>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_ZJNX0viM</a>. This version of the demonstration of the traffic light working with an LCD screen connected.</p> <p>Further discussion of the traffic light code can be watched at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBnWOX3wGE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBnWOX3wGE</a>.</p> <h2 id=controller-software>Controller Software</h2> <p>The controller currently uses .NET 5. It is divided into two projects.</p> <h3 id=user-interface-ui-front-end>User Interface (UI) / Front End</h3> <p>The user interface is a .NET MVC application. When you select the program that you want to run from the application home page, the application then runs a linux command that runs the back end program. When the program is changed on the front end, the back end program is then terminated and the newly select program is started.</p> <h3 id=relay-control-back-end>Relay Control / Back End</h3> <p>The back end of the application is a .NET Worker Service. The program modes are defined within this worker service. The worker service will continue running until it is terminated by the front end application or by a user via the command line or SSH.</p> <h2 id=controller-hardware>Controller Hardware</h2> <h3 id=relays>Relays</h3> <p>Relays are used when devices of different voltages or amperages are being used together. One common example of this is relays that are used to control headlights on a car. The switch inside the vehicle has a lower amperage and is considered to be a "signal wire". When the switch is turned on, a relay is closed which then connects a different circuit to turn on and off the headlights.</p> <p>In the Traffic Pi project, relays are used in a similar manner. The Raspberry Pi outputs 3.3VDC from the GPIO pins. Those pins are connected to a relay board. The relay board is also connected to a 120VAC which is needed by each of the signals. When the Pi sends an "on" signal to the relay board, the relay activates, thus sending 120VAC from the source (in this case a wall outlet) to the signal and then corresponding signal then turns on.</p> <h3 id=wiring>Wiring</h3> <p>The color of each wire always denotes its purpose. When using different color wires, you don't need to have a tag on each wire. Instead, you create a service manual or other documentation that lists the purpose of each wire based on its color.</p> <p>For example, if you look a wiring harness on a car, you will notice that it has a number of wires that are bundled together. Each of those wires has a purpose. The vehicle manufacturers create a document, often referred to as a service manual, that lists each of the colors of the wire in the harness and their purpose.</p> <p>With an AC circuit, there are commonly 3 wires. Black, white, and bare copper or green. Black wire in AC circuit represents the "hot" or supply voltage. White wire in AC Circuit represents the neutral. Green or bare copper wire in AC Circuit represents the ground.</p> <p>With a DC Circuit, there are two wires. Red and black. Red wire in DC circuit represents the positive. This is the voltage that comes from the power source. Black wire in DC circuits represents the negative. This is the voltage that goes back to the power source.</p> <h3 id=ac-vs-dc>AC vs DC</h3> <p>The current in an AC system alternates between the hot and neutral wires. The frequency at which this occurs varies. In North America (including the United States), the alternation takes place at 60 Hertz (Hz) or 60 times per second. In other parts of the world, this alternation takes place at 50 Hz per second. AC circuits are commonly used for items that require a lot of power to operate. These include large motors, like the ones used in AC refrigeration and industrial machines.</p> <p>DC circuits are commonly used for battery powered systems, electronics, and other devices that do not require a lot of power to operate. If a device, such as a cell phone or streaming player, has a "power brick", then that device runs on DC power. The power brick converts the AC power to DC power and at the same time reduces the voltage to what the device needs.</p> <h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2> <ul> <li>LCD Display code for controlling the LCD display were provided from <a href=https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd target=_blank>https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd</a>.</li> <li>Attempts to replicate the Traffic Light Simulation created by Samuel Vidal seen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqZRDtX64UA" target=_blank>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqZRDtX64UA</a> influenced this project.</li> <li>Wifi AP configuration steps provided by <a href=https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-wireless-access-point/ target=_blank>https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-wireless-access-point/</a></li> </ul> <h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2> <h3 id=where-did-you-get-the-traffic-light-from>Where did you get the traffic light from?</h3> <p>Ebay.
