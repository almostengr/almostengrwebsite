* **Technology** - All things related to computers, the internet, software, and web development.
* **Lifestyle** - Life is difficult enough. I feel that we can all learn from others and their experiences
on this journey. I share stories and thoughts that I have learned along the way.
* **Gardening** - Fresh food? Of course! Having a garden not only means that you have fresh food
when you choose, but maintaining the garden is a great stress reliever.
* **DIY** - I enjoy repairing and building things, including home improvement projects and car repairs.
