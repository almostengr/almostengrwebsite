He has years of experience in building web based applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living, often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for that code snippet and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for. Gardening Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After having some seasons of little success and being able to literately taste the fruits of my labor, Kenny decided to expand his green thumb skill set. Thanks to social media, Kenny found other that some friends and former classmates also had an interest in gardening and they were looking for help. After attending a class at a local urban farm about gardening, it occurred to him that a blog could be used as a journal to track my successes and failures. Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located in the southeastern United States. That being said, the recommendations and suggestions that are made on this blog are for this growing zone and are not guaranteed to work in other growing zones. However, please do feel free to experiment in your garden and share your experiences. Why Does Kenny Blog? Kenny has been blogging his gardening, technology experiences, and mishaps for several reasons: you learn from your past mistakes others can learn from your mistakes before they make them you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going. \"The Almost Engineer\" Explanation If you have read this far down the page, you probably are wondering how did Kenny come up with The Almost Engineer name. Kenny works (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field of Computer Science, has great problem solving skills, and enjoys fixing things instead of paying someone else to do it for him. However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer. Blog Technology Originally, Kenny started blogging on Blogger in 2011. After several years of a having the blog there, the blog was converted to Drupal 7. At the time of this switch, Kenny was using Drupal 7 on a number of websites that Kenny was building and maintaining. So it made sense to use it for his personal use. In 2019, Kenny converted the blog again from Drupal 7 over to MKDocs. The reason for this conversion was because he found myself spending more time performing maintenance updates than writing content. He outlines this more in his post on switching from Drupal to MkDocs .","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#it-information-technology-professional","text":"Kenny's day job is working as an IT professional.

Low and slow or hot and fast . Thus I have broken up the steps in this post to describe both depending on how much time that you have. Regardless the method that you choose, the ingredients are the same for both recipes. Required Kitchen Tools an oven dutch oven or cast iron pot (I use a cast iron pot) spatula baking sheet (for Low and Slow) Ingredients 1 whole chicken seasonings of your choosing (in the photo above, I used McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning) lemon, cut in to quarters or eighths (optional) onions, cut in quarters or eighths (optional) Low and Slow Steps Preheat oven to 250 F (121 C) Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs Dry the skin with paper towel Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin) with the spices of your choosing; if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator or go directly into the oven Place in the oven and let cook for about 4 hours. Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken. Bird is done when your thermometer reads at least 160 F (71 C) at the thigh and breast Remove the pot from the oven Turn your oven on to Broil. Remove the chicken from the pot and place onto a baking sheet. NOTE: There will be a lot of liquid in the pot. The last step of this section addresses this. NOTE: It is easier to remove the chicken from the pot if you cut it in half first. I usually use a spatula to cut the chicken in half (yes it is that tender that you do not need a knife). Then use the spatula to remove the chicken halves in a single piece from the pot to the baking sheet. Place the chicken back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken once the skin has reached your preferred level of crispiness. With the liquid that remains in the pot, you can use it to make chicken broth or chicken gravy. Then the chicken is ready to serve. Hot And Fast Steps Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C) Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs Dry the skin with paper towel Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin) with the spices of your choosing; if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator or go directly into the oven Place in the oven and let cook for about 30 minutes. (This is to crispy up the skin) Turn the oven down to 400 F (204 C) and allow to continue cooking for about 2 hours. Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken.

Those updates include posting the current song and providing alerts when problems are detected. This application is ONLY designed to run on Falcon Pi Players that are installed on Raspberry Pi. How Does It Work Tweeting Song Information This application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the meta data for the song that is current playing. Then it uses that information to compose a tweet. If the song that is playing does not have ID3 tag information entered, then will not display part or all of the song data. If you need to add the song meta data to the file, you can use a program like Audacity to do so. Tweeting Temperature Alerts The application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the current temperature of the Raspberry Pi. If it is above the threshold that is specified in the appsettings.json file, then it will send a tweet that mentions the users specified in the appsettings.json file a message to let them know if the current temperature. When the temperature drops below the threshold, then another tweet is sent. Source Code Source code for this project is hosted on Github . Installation Instructions Download the latest release that is available in zip or tar format. Copy the archive file to your Raspberry Pi. Extract the archive file contents. Ideally extract them to a folder in the /home/fpp directory. Create a Twitter Developer account . Once approved, create a project. Within that project, create Consumer Key (aka API Key), Consumer Secret (aka API Secret), Access Token and Access Secret. Also within that project, update the App Permissions to \"Read and Write\". By default, permissions are \"Read\". Copy appsettings.template.json to appsettings.json. Add the key, secrets, and token that you got from your Twitter developer account to the appsettings.json file. See Example appsettings.json File and About appsettings.json File for explainations and details. Create a cronjob that will run the automation on startup. See Creating Cronjob for explaination. Reboot your Raspberry Pi Once the Pi has come back online, check the log file to confirm that the monitor has started. You should see output similar to the below at the beginning of the log file.

Think about it... do you really remember how much fertilizer that you used 4 years ago on the tomato plants? Probably not. Do you remember how many times that squirrels ate the strawberries before you did last season? Probably not. Do you know how many days that it rained last summer? Probably not. These are just a few examples of why you need to keep track of what you have observed and what you have done in your garden. I use this blog as my garden journal because I'm able to share with others what I've learned from running a garden. What do you need to keep track of in your journal? That's up to you! I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks: weather conditions, including temperature whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants when fertilizer was applied and how much when you started your seedlings when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest pictures of your observations Paper or digital (online) journal?

I've chosen to do an online blog because I know I can type faster than I write. Now if you have a digital or online blog, it is easier to find what you are looking for as you can utilize the search functionality.

If you have a paper journal, you would have to manually look page by page until you found your latest harvest information. How often should I write in my journal? I would recommend writing a new entry daily or when significant events take place. For instance, if you have non-stop rain for an entire week, I would make note of that in a journal entry. Planting new vegetables for the growing season, make a new journal entry. Squirrels eat half of your three tomatoes, make a journal entry (and remove the half eaten tomatoes from the vine).

Garden Harvest In total, I picked about 2 pounds of greens and still didn't make a dent in the on hand supply. I think part of the reason for the greens being able to grow so large is due to the large amounts of rain that have taken place in recent weeks. Also being able to control the snails, catepillar worms, and other pests that feed on them with a mixture of salt and flour has helped. Without this occasional pest control, they would devour the leaves resulting in holes or entire leaves missing. This week's weather has multiple frosty nights in the forecast.

As some of you may know, I have, for years, planted my fruits and vegetables mostly in containers and pots instead of directly in the ground. I\u2019ve learned a number of lessons about the differences between planting in the ground vs planting in containers. I\u2019ll cover that in another post. In this post, I will cover how I built multiple raised beds out of concrete blocks. Step 1: How Big and How Many Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started. I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case. For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that\u2019s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side. I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row. If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks that you need. Step 2: Time To Go Shopping For this project, you will need the following: (Please consider using the affiliate links below this post. They help to support this website) concrete blocks (see Step 1 for how many blocks) spirit level (see link below) 2 feet wide object (a lawn mower works) Construction / Work Gloves masonry adhesive (optional) Why concrete blocks? Modern concrete blocks are made of just that... concrete (sand, water, cement). Considerations for using concrete blocks: the ones that you buy will mostlikely not contain any chemicals or other things that are poisionious or dangerous to your health. I would advise not getting blocks from unknown sources. are more expensive than wood. The total amount for the 56 blocks that I purchased was $84, before discounts and taxes have a very long outdoor life regardless of what the weather or ground conditions are like If you do not have the money for concrete blocks, then wood is an option. Considerations for using wood: wood is cheaper than concrete blocks. If you are looking to do gardening for the long term, the cheaper initial cost will be negated by the recurring replacement cost of the wood use untreated wood. Treated wood contains chemicals that can be hazardous to your health if consumed. the outdoor life of untreated wood is shorter than that of concrete. That means that if you live in an area with a lot of rainfall or high water table, that the wood will rot faster than average and therefore will need to be replaced sooner. Step 3: Site Selection After you have purchased the items above, you need to select a flat or mostly flat spot in your yard. My yard actually slopes towards one corner of the yard, so there isn't a truely flat spot in the yard. If you read other articles, they will recommend leveling out the place where you will be placing the blocks to be level. Personally I did not level out anything as digging up dirt and grading it so that it is level is back-breaking work, unless you have a bobcat or some other heavy machinery to assist you with the job. However if your growing space is significantly out of level, I would recommend that you do some grading of the ground. Step 4: Dropping Bricks Now... do not actually drop the brick wildy as it might land on your foot or smash to pieces. Once you have identified your location, start placing your blocks according to the configuration that you have decided on. For this step, you can use the spirit level to make sure that the blocks line up with one another. If you have chosen to secure your blocks, you can use the masonry adhesive between each block that you place. Step 5: Spacing Between Beds If you are making multiple beds, you will want to make a pathway between each of the beds so that have access to all of the sides of the grow bed. For the sake of simplicity, I used my lawn mower to determine the width of the spacing between the beds. Most push and walk behind lawn mowers are between 18 and 22 inches wide. That is almost two feet of space that you did not have to measure. In addition, as you lay out your bed, you do not have to continously re-check the width of the walking path to make sure that it is equal. You now have as much growing space that you can manage. In the next post, I will cover the dirt that I use for the beds.","title":"Building Raised Garden Beds"},{"location":"gardening/2019-03-11-building-raised-garden-beds/#step-1-how-big-and-how-many","text":"Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started.

The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) is based out of Auburn University (it hurts to type that... Roll Tide... That's better!) and Alabama A and M University. Each county has a county extension office that has resources and information about growing a variety of plants in that county. They do soil testing in addition to community training programs on topics including vegetable gardening, pollination, and more. There are number of resources and publications available on their website for almost everything agricultural. Do note that the resources are targeted for Alabama, but they may apply in other states. I have not had the opportunity to fully use the app at the time of this writing, but will do a follow up post after I plant my summer garden. From my limited usage, I have been able to determine the below pros and cons: Pros Has information for a number of plants, including days to maturity, when to plant, and plant spacing What can be planted today to be a successful grower Farmer's market locations Contacting your local county extension directly from the app Cons Does not allow for the exporting of data entered into the app. Designed only for Alabama. However it can be used for tracking your gardening activities. However the planting dates and information may be incorrect if you live outside of the USDA growing zones that exist in Alabama. At the time of this post, it has not been updated since 2016. It only has information for 37 vegetables and fruits. This is far less than what can be grown in Alabama. Steps to Do Setup 1) Initial set up has to be done. You have to enter the county that you are located in to begin using the app. 2) A number of options are available with this app including contacting the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. 3) SOW App recommends what plants to plant and when it can be planted. Conclusion Now if you look at the rating for this app, it only has 3 stars at the time of this writing. However, if you read the comments that are associated with the reviews, it has some negative reviews from people that do not live in the state of Alabama because the app is not designed for their state. The reviews from those that do live in Alabama, seem to be at least 3 starts or above. Starting this growing season, I will be using it to see how it fairs with actual usage.

Just a demostration showing the process of what I did get it done. Just removing a dead and decaying tree limb from a tree. The limb has been dead for some time. It was resting a branch that was in front of it. Also some of the upper limbs would break off during windy conditions, thus creating a safety hazard. The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking. Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free. Next I tried to push down the branch. However this did not work as I was not able to get much leverage from pushing. In addition, the limb would slide back after pushing. Since that attempt failed, I got a tow rope and connected it to the tree. The tow rope was slick, so I put a shovel on the other end of the rope to use it as a handle. After a number of pulls, I was able to get the branch down on the ground so that it can be removed and no longer a safety hazard.","title":"Manual Tree Branch Tear Down"},{"location":"gardening/2019-03-19-containers-vs-in-ground-gardening/","text":"If you live in a small space container gardening works very great. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to doing container gardening or gardening in pots versus putting your fruits and vegetables directly into the ground. In this post I'm a cover those differences that I've experienced with my growing experiences. So for the past several years I have been growing all of my purse and vegetables in containers instead of the putting them directly in the ground. However, I have noticed that my neighbor has majority of his plant directly in the ground or in raised beds. So after doing some years of research of just only planting in containers or pots these are some things that I've noticed about this process. The Benefits Having your plant in a container versus directly in the ground allows you to better customize the soil to based upon the plant that is that particular container. For instance blueberries have a tendency to prefer more acidic soil versus less a tomato plants. That being said if you have a blueberry plant in just a specific container you can adjust the ratios of your soil so that it is acidic versus having an entire bed that has to be adaptable to a wide variety of everything that you put in that bed. Another benefit of planting in containers is that you can move the container or wherever you need to depending upon the time of year. For instance some plants require more sun song require more shade. As the seasons change you can move the plant to a more shaded area if the plant actually needs more shade or move it to a more Sunny your area and if it needs more sun. Growing in containers actually can restrict the limit of how far the plants can grow out. For instance peppermint plants, is a very vine-like plant. That being said I planted a peppermint plant in a container of about two years ago and after about a year to a year-and-a-half, the peppermint plant had actually become almost root bound in that container. In addition, the peppermint plant itself was actually trying to grow out of the container but it wasn't able to do so since the container was fairly high off the ground and it wasn't able to actually take root into the ground itself. The Negatives The major thing that I've noticed about container gardening is that the soil in the containers have a tendency to dry out faster during hotter weather. The reason is that the pot only can hold so much water and once that water start to evaporate it can't pull water from anywhere else. In my scenario from the last several years, I've actually had to make sure that I watered the container plants every day or every other day and depending upon the temperature and when the last time it rained. Another negative that exist with using containers or pots is that when the weather becomes very severe that the container can actually flip over depending on is dementia. I've used 5-gallon buckets and the five gallon buckets during severe weather in Alabama can lead up to winds in the 40 or more mile an hour range. With these high winds or higher winds, this can result in the plant being knocked over and dirt falling out as well as any reserve water being knocked out as well. This past winter, I noticed that the birds that were migrating through my area would land in the yard and go under the plants that were directly into the ground however they would not go into the ones that were in containers or pots. I'm not sure why that was the case, but it may have had something to do with the birds not being able to see what is in the pot before they go flying into it. Now you may think that birds being able to get into a pot is very insignificant, but they actually play a major role in farming and gardening. In my experience has the birds actually eat the pests like ladybugs, caterpillars, and horn worms, just to name a few, that would normally attack the leaves on the plants that you are growing. With all this being said, this year I will be growing with a combination of in ground beds as well as containers and pots. Hopefully this has given you a good perspective of the differences between growing in the ground versus growing in a container or a pot.

I recently got asked by a high school classmate how I got started with my garden and any tips that I could provide them with to help them get started with hers. In addition, the big box stores are having their spring Black Friday sales. Which means plants and all things plant related,including dirt, tools, etc. are on sale right now. Check your local sales paper for the dates and the details. With the spring Black Friday sale, this is the perfect time for you to start your summer garden. Below I have outlined 8 steps for you to get started. Step 1) Determine A Location The first step to get started with a garden is to determine where you are going to set up your garden in the amount of sunlight that that area gets in a day. If you intend on growing fruits and vegetables this season, then you will want to pick a spot that has mostly sun or is full sun throughout the entire day. The reason is that most fruits and vegetables require a lot of energy to generate those fruits and vegetables that we enjoy, or hate if you are a kid. Step 2) Container Garden Or In The Ground Once you have decided where you want to set up your garden, then you will need to determine whether you are doing a container garden or a garden in the ground or raised beds. I categorize in the ground and raised beds into the same category because they're both permanent fixtures that you set up. Container garden includes putting plants inside of a container, such as a 5 gallon (18.93 liters) bucket, a pot, an old trash can, or a drum. You get the idea. When I first started gardening, I gardened with only containers. This year I've expanded to gardening with raised beds using cinder blocks in addition to the containers I already have. Step 3) Gardening Tools Next you'll want to purchase some gardening tools. You don't need any advanced tools for most of the work. At the very minimum, you want to have a shovel and gloves . The size of the shovel will be determined by what type of garden you choose to set up. A container garden only needs to have a hand shovel whereas a raised bed or in-ground garden needs to have a full size shovel . If you're setting up a raised bed or in-ground garden, I recommend that you also purchase a rake . The rake will help you to level out the dirt and other materials that you are placing in your garden. Gardening gloves will be used to protect your hands. However, if you have latex or other type of gloves those will do the job as well. Step 4) All Dirt Is Not Equal Once you have decided on the type of garden that you want set up, then you will need to get the type of soil that corresponds to the type of garden that you're going to set up. I know what you are thinking...there are different types of soil? Yes there are two distinct types of soil that are sold at the big box stores. The first type of soil is called garden soil. Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used in some type of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them. Whereas the water that's in the ground can be drawn in by plant even if it's not directly underneath the plant or in the soil that the plant is in direct contact with. Step 5) Soil Amendments The soil that you buy from the store can be used immediately. However, when I buy soil from the store, I always add some amendments to it to better the growth of my plants. Those amendments include Epsom salt, peat moss, and compost. For my plants, I use 1/3 of soil, 1/3 of peat moss, and 1/3 of compost. I use the \"it looks about right\" method when measuring out the materials. However if you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added. Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally do not come with soil or from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients. Organic matter is vital to the growth of the plant as the goal of having a healthy garden is to have a sustainable ecosystem. Step 6) Fruits, Vegetables, or Flowers Now that you have your soil you can decide on what type of plants that you want to put in the soil. When you go to purchase the plants that you want to Garden, be sure to look at the tag that comes with the plant. On the tag it will include how much sunlight that the plant needs in order to survive, The water requirements, and what the plant is. When I plant my fruits and vegetables, I usually leave the tag and next to where the plant is. That way in the future I know what the plant is that I'm looking at in a given location. If you happen to lose the tag that goes with a particular plant or a plant does not come with a tag, you can use a plastic butter knife next to the plant and write the name of the plant on the butter knife. Depending on the length of the growing season in the region that you are in, some Fruits and vegetables may not be possible to be grown in your area as it may not be warm enough for the correct amount of days. Step 7) Just Add Water Plants, like any other living creature, need water. The guidelines that I follow regarding water for my outdoor plants is every other day during the hottest part of the season. During the cooler parts of the year, I usually water as needed. This need is determined based upon how dry the top inch to inch and a half of the soil is. If it rains on a given day during the hottest part of the season, I do not water my plants. The reason being is that you want the plants to be able to manage without going daily with water, in case you decide to go on vacation. Step 8) Now That's Some Good Eating I know the section heading is not grammatically correct, but it does prove a point. Once your fruits or vegetables have reached their harvest date,then they are free to pick. How do you know what the harvest date is? The harvest date is written on the tag that comes with the plant. It is possible that the fruit or vegetable can be harvested prior or after the harvest date, but it's not advisable to do so as you want the plant to mature to the best of his ability. Do note that the harvest day is more of an advisory than an exact measurement. The conditions that the plant is in,such as the amount of sun, the amount of water, the health of the soil all play a factor into whether that harvest day is exact or not.

You can leave them in the yard and eventually they will blow into the street, decompose, or blow into the neighbors yard on their own. I took this approach one season and all was good during the winter time. However, when the weather started getting warmer, the grass was not growing. Come to find out, the leaves have smothered the grass during the winter. Thus resulting the grass dying completely and weeds taking over like they had nothing else to do. This is an approach that I would not recommend, especially if you like to have a lush, green lawn. Blow Them Away I have one neighbor that blows all of his leaves from his yard to the curb. Then the city will come by and scoop them up with other tree, limb, and other debris. In turn, the city uses those leaves for mulch, compost, or other projects around the city like in parks or roadside greenways. Chop It Up This is my preferred method. Pull out the lawn mower and mulch the leaves. In years past, I've mulched them and left them on the ground to decompose. This helps return the nutrients that were removed from the soil, to go back into the soil. Also prevents the need to bag the leaves, which means more work. I rarely bag leaves, as it adds unnecessarily to the landfill. If you have a compost pile, leaves are good brown material that can be added to the pile.

Greens don't make seeds until the spring or summer time. When they make seeds, they make a lot. Not sure at this point whether I'm going to let them continue to grow in the grass or cut the grass and greens once the summer growing season starts. For now, they will remain. It is possible that they may outgrow the surrounding grass and weeds. If they do, the shade produced by the greens will reduce the chance of grass growing near them. Red Romaine For about week in early December, we had temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s for several days in a row. I believe that it was at this time that the red romaine decided to go from leafy mode to seed mode. When I first noticed this, I pulled the blooms off of the plant in hopes that it would switch back to leaf mode with the colder temperatures that followed. However, it did not and as a result the leaves are still narrow on the plant. Raised Beds The items that are in the raised beds that I set up in the spring of 2019 are not doing as well as the items that are in other containers or directly in the ground. I think this, in part, has to do with the fact that I put pine mulch in the raised beds in the beginning of the spring season. What I found out after I put the mulch down, was that pine mulch usually makes the soil acidic. I'm not sure how acidic it made the soil, but based on the articles that I read about it, it can lower the pH to 5 or 4 range. The tomatoes that grew in the same bed in the spring, did extremely well. However, the lettuce, cabbage, and greens that are currently in the bed are not doing as well. In some of the raised beds, I have added ashes from the firepit to the bed. The articles that I read suggested that by doing this, the soil will become more basic as the ashes break down. Weather The weather for the last couple of weeks has ranged from being close to freezing to the lower 70s on Christmas. It has rained at least one day each week.","title":"Greens in Grass"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#greens-in-the-grass","text":"For the last couple of years, I have grown various greens, usually collard or mustard, in the same general area of my yard.

If they do, the shade produced by the greens will reduce the chance of grass growing near them.","title":"Greens in the Grass"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#red-romaine","text":"For about week in early December, we had temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s for several days in a row. I believe that it was at this time that the red romaine decided to go from leafy mode to seed mode. When I first noticed this, I pulled the blooms off of the plant in hopes that it would switch back to leaf mode with the colder temperatures that followed. However, it did not and as a result the leaves are still narrow on the plant.","title":"Red Romaine"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#raised-beds","text":"The items that are in the raised beds that I set up in the spring of 2019 are not doing as well as the items that are in other containers or directly in the ground. I think this, in part, has to do with the fact that I put pine mulch in the raised beds in the beginning of the spring season. What I found out after I put the mulch down, was that pine mulch usually makes the soil acidic. I'm not sure how acidic it made the soil, but based on the articles that I read about it, it can lower the pH to 5 or 4 range. The tomatoes that grew in the same bed in the spring, did extremely well. However, the lettuce, cabbage, and greens that are currently in the bed are not doing as well. In some of the raised beds, I have added ashes from the firepit to the bed. The articles that I read suggested that by doing this, the soil will become more basic as the ashes break down.","title":"Raised Beds"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#weather","text":"The weather for the last couple of weeks has ranged from being close to freezing to the lower 70s on Christmas.

Normally lettuces and other leafy greens do well during the winter season due to the cooler temperatures and the occasional frost that controls bugs and sweetens the leaves. This winter season, we have experienced temperatures in the low and mid 70s for several days to a week at a time. That is definitely unseasonably warm, and as a result, all of the red lettuce and some of the green leaf lettuce bolted in the middle of December. I remove the flowers that were starting to appear when I first noticed the lettuce flowering and that got some of them back in check. However the red lettuce was committed to making flowers, so I removed it from the garden. It is currently in cue in the firepit so that it can dry out and be used back in the garden as compost. Onions I have a green onion that I planted several years ago. This winter, it has grown a lot bigger and taller than in years past while remaining in the same container. I did make a IG post about this particular plant and how big that it has gotten. The backstory about this particular onion, is that I got it from either Blue Apron or the grocery store. I do not recall which. If you watch videos or read articles about gardening, they will suggest that you do not use store bought fruits and vegetables in your garden as they will not do well. This onion plant has proved that to be far from the truth. Like any other plant, if you put it in the right environment and give it what it needs, it will grow and multiply. Collard and Mustard Greens Once I got to planting the leafy greens that I was going to grow for the season, I realized that I probably bought more than what I should have. I have greens all over the place, with several of the plants having leaves over one foot long. Seriously. In another recent IG post, I showed that there are greens that have taken root from the seeds that have dropped off in the grass in my yard. If you missed that post, you can watch it on my Instagram page . Those greens have since continued to grow. I plan on digging them up to be relocated as they currently are in the place where I plan on expanding my deck. I will be sure to provide a progress report on those in the future. Weather Weather since the last post as been a mix of rain and sun. There were several severe storms that have passed through the area.

After growing something in the garden for several years, I figured that it was time to give it a break. Observations Things like onion chives and garlic chives have managed several frosts that have occurred during the winter. This two herbs are both in a raised bed and a pots. The onion plant did create seeds last year, so those will probably self plant themselves and grow more onion plants this year as I did not collect the seeds. Pine Mulch In 2019, I used Pine mulch in the garden. Laid it on thick. What I eventually found out was that the pine mulch can change the acidity of the soil. Given that I had put a lot of it down, I think it really changed the acidity of the soil. Reason I say this is because things that would normally grow without much difficulty, such as tomatoes, were struggling to keep afloat. I thought about, but never did, get a soil test done to confirm this theory. A lot of the signs were present. In 2020, I turned that mulch into the soil in addition to adding amendments to the soil to give the plants what they need to be successful. I did see a better outcome in 2020 because of this and have learned a valuable lesson in doing so. Hackberry Trees I used the winter time of the year, to cut down some trees that were along the property line. These trees are called Hackberry Trees. In 2017, I had one split. It the split portion of the tree fell over into my yard. In 2019, there was another Hackberry Tree that split. This time it split over into the neighbor's yard. I have also had branches randomly break off and split from other Hackberry Trees. The reason that I wanted to cut the trees was because: they block a lot of the southern and western sunlight from reaching the garden during the summer time. wanted to reduce the chance of having another tree splitting and landing in the neighbors yard. there were two many trees along the property line. Thus wanted to thin them out as some of them had their growth stunted by other trees. In total, I cut two trees down. One was about 25 feet (7.62 meters) tall, the other about 20 feet (6.096 meters) tall. After cutting them down into managable pieces, they will be placed on the firewood stand that I built to dry and eventually be burned in the firepit. In the later summer of 2020, I cut down 3 Hackberry Trees. Unfortunately, I got multiple bites, from what I believe were spider bites, and had to seek treatment for those bites as they severely itched. Figured the winter season, would kill them off and less like to have that happen again. Hackberry Trees Splitting What I found from doing some internet research, it is very common for Hackberry Trees to split where to or more branches meet. The reason being is that the meeting point for the branches have a tendency to develop into a bowl shape instead of like the peak of a roof. This bowl shape, holds water and over time the water rots out the branch. Once enough rot has formed, the weight of the branch causes the branch to break or, in my case, the tree to split in half do to the weight of the branches. Collard and Mustard Greens I still have collard greens in the garden. These greens were planted around late 2018 and have gone to seed and kept growing. This is not normal behavior as the other collard greens that were planted in the raised beds and in containers have died off after they went to seed. I also have some mustard greens that are starting to grow now. I assume these are from the seeds that fell off the previously growing plants. I will probably dig them up before they get too big and put them in one of the growing beds so that they have a better chance of surviving the upcoming growing season. 2021 Growing Plans This year and I plan on sticking with some of the same veggies that I have grown in the past, such as bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, garlic chives, onion chives, and mint. Want to add more fruits this year, but not sure which ones as tomatoes usually draw some bugs that I'm not familiar with and are difficult to get rid of. Also want to be better about documenting about what is going on in the garden this year. This will allow me to better keep track of past experiences and share those experiences with others.","title":"Starting the Garden for Spring 2021"},{"location":"gardening/2021.02.09-starting-the-garden-for-spring/#observations","text":"Things like onion chives and garlic chives have managed several frosts that have occurred during the winter.

Bought it online and installed it myself within a weekend. The kit that I purchased came with the MyQ Internet gateway. You can watch my video review about the opener on YouTube . The Pros It is very quiet. If I open the door while standing on the other side of the house, I barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving. The opener was very easy to install. If you already have a garage door installed, adding this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall. The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there. This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if I chose to change my mind in the future. It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers. In my garage, I have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch. The Cons Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on. I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem. If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home. For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this. I did check the MyQ message board and saw that others have complained about this and a Liftmaster representative responded. However Liftmaster hasn't provide an update to this defect. The MyQ app doesn't always close the door back immediately after it has opened. With my android phone, if I press the button on my phone to close the door within 20 seconds of it being opened, the door doesn't close. However if I force close the app, reopen it, and then press the button to close the door, the door proceeds to close. This is another complaint that i have seen on the MyQ message board.

Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are utilized during a flush. It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it was good that it was caught at this point. Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom.

Video Transcript IF YOUR TOILET LEAPS LIKE THIS ON THE SIDE WHILE YOU'RE FLUSHING THE TOILET YOU PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE THE GASKET I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP HOW TO REPLACE THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLTS I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION LISTED ON THE PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK THE WATER UP STEP 3 DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT STEP 5 REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE THE OLD GASKET IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO IT BEING STRETCHED AND BEING IN USE FOR A WHILE THE NEW GAS THAT IS SMALLER BUT SHOULD FIT AS IT IS MADE OUT OF RUBBER STEP 6 INSTALL THE NEW GASKET THE NEW GASKET GOES OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND YOU MAY HAVE TO STRETCH IT TO FIT AS I DID IN MY CASE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO STRETCH IT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASILY AS IT IS A RUBBER GASKET ONCE YOU GET IT ON MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN IN AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO SPACE OR ROOM FOR LEAKAGE STEP 7 CLEAN THE MOUNTING POINTS AS YOU SEE THE MOUNTING POINTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BOLT ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET IS VERY DIRTY AND EVEN WITH SOME BLACK CORROSION BE SURE TO CLEAN THESE OFF AS YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CLEAN SO THAT IT MAKES A GREAT SEAL WHEN WHEN CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER IF YOU LEAVE ANY DIRT BEHIND IT MAY NOT CONNECT AS WELL AND YOU STILL MAY END UP HAVING A LEAK AFTER YOU GET DONE STEP 8 INSTALL THE NEW BOLTS SO BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE BOLT AND PUT IN THE RUBBER WASHER AND YOU PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOLT HEAD AND THEN LAYING THE TANK DOWN YOU'LL SIT THE BOLT THROUGH THE BOLT HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL AND THERE'S TWO OF THESE SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS PROCESS TWICE ONE FOR THE LEFT ONE FOR THE RIGHT THEN IF YOU NEED TO YOU CAN ADD THE WASHER AND THE NUT ON THE BOTTOM ON THE PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAVE IT STATED THAT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONFIGURATION OF HOW THE TOILET IS BUILT SINCE MY TOILET PREVIOUSLY HAD A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION I DECIDED TO INSTALL A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION STEP 9 INSTALL THE TANK SO TAKE THE TANK MAKE SURE YOU LINE THE BOLT HOLES UP AND LAY IT ON THE OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE TOILET FLANGE YOU MAY WANT TO ROCK IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ACTUALLY SEALS IN VERY WELL STEP 10 INSTALL WASHERS AND NUTS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL WASHERS AND NUTS THAT GO UNDER THE TANK ITSELF THAT CONNECT THE TANK TO THE ACTUAL PART OF THE BOWL IN THE REAR YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THESE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER WITH A RUBBER WASHER ON TOP A METAL WASHER NEXT TO THAT AND THEN FINALLY THE NUT AT THE END BE SURE TONIGHT OVER-TIGHTEN BEAT THE NUT AT THE END BECAUSE IF YOU OVER TIGHTEN IT YOU CAN CORRECT A CERAMIC ON THE TOILET AND IF YOU PRACTICE CERAMIC OF THE TOILET YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER TOILET IT IS PREFERRED THAT YOU DO A HAND TIGHTEN ONLY AS YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED AND CAN STOP APPLYING PRESSURE BEFORE THE CERAMIC CRACKS STEP 11 RECONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE SO AS YOU DID THE DISCONNECT OF THE SUPPLY LINE YOU BASICALLY UNDO WHAT YOU PROVEN IS DONE SO REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP 12 TURN ON THE WATER I RECOMMEND TURNING ON THE WATER MAYBE A HALF TO ONE TURN AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE NO LEAKS OR YOU DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TURNING FURTHER IF YOU TURN IT ALL THE WAY ON AND IT STARTS LEAKING THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ALL THE WAY BACK OFF THEREFORE YOU CREASE THE CHANCES OF GETTING WATER ON YOUR FLOOR AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT IS NOT WANTED STEP 13 FLUSH AND CHECK THE LEAKS ONCE YOU VERIFY THAT THERE IS NO MORE LEAKS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL ALSO IF YOU LIKE INSTANT NOTIFICATIONS

Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are utilized during a flush. It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it was good that it was caught at this point. Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom.","title":"Background"},{"location":"handyman/2018.07.21-how-to-replace-toilet-gasket-and-bolts/#video","text":"If you have comments or questions about the video, please leave them on the

PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK THE WATER UP STEP 3 DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT STEP 5 REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE THE OLD

The panel only had 4 of the 26 breakers labeled. So by labelling, it would be easier to know which breaker to switch off in the future in case an issue occurred. Video Video Transcript Thanks for checking out this video. I'm going to show you how to go around and identify the outlets and the lights and which breaker they are connected to in your breaker panel. Thanks for tuning in. if you have not already please subscribe down in the button below. so when you go to do electrical work i.e. if you're changing out a light switch if a plug has an issue and you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to. in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself. the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the ones that are odd numbered starting with the top down you have one event all the way down to the harbor mini Breakers that you have on that particular side so on my outside the breaker number highest ranking number is 25 so I will stop at 25 and then I will start with the even numbers of 2 4 and 6 and I was like that and then use autocomplete to and at 26 which is the highest number that I have on the right hand side so the first record that I have in the number one position is the bath Outlet as well as the exterior Outlets saw internet in and then I will also include the amperage which is 28 and then I will go to the next one which is not connected so I'll just know that is not connected and then I will put in the next two are the air conditioner compressor or connected to the air conditioner compressor and then I will continue this process and then once I get all the way filled in down to 25 and print this out I will actually cut this between Rose 14 and 15 and I will actually add another header here on row 15 so insert an entire row and then copy this header here so that and I can add as actually had another roll so that I have some spacing in between so when I do go to cut this I don't have to be very exact with my cut and sew cut this between here and then so I have the even breakers on one side and then excuse me. Breakers on one side and then he even bring his on the other side now if you have a panel where the door opens sideways you could actually move emails over so that they are side-by-side like this and that way you can better see and then you only have to use one shut up a paper printout to do this however since my breaker panel actually opens up instead of to the left or to the right and going to do this way and split it sideways so I can put them side-by-side on next to space in between the edge of the breaker in the edge of the panel in the breaker itself so for the sales that are really long like this one and these here but I'm actually going to do is through this entire column and set it to do word wrap in LibreOffice calc need to go to text and a text under the format menu and then you can resize a column into text Will resize accordingly and so I'm going to actually shorten breaker number to this breaker and that way it'll allow me to use this room here I can you guys leave an abbreviated if you want to use for space and so I do have one breaker here that is a arc fault or ground-fault breaker breaker actually labeled in the end column that it isn't scription of that is our Breakers to clearly distinguish some reason this sale did not wrap correctly so you may have simply of formatting issues that come up like this and just have to go in and double check on them and if worst case we align the row to get it to do right to be here now is doing correctly are you in some places use the abbreviations to try to help with the wrapping so for instance here instead of spelling kitchen out I just took out all of the files that were in the word kitchen until you get something here that resembles the kitchen counter so counter counter I took out all the vowels yet again so you have cnpr you can kind of figure that out just no reasoning and same thing here with front how do you say it's not fully showing a hold of wrapping correctly so the same thing here with fry and so I will also do the headings on this one and make those bold you know that goes are there and then if you want to you can actually make these rolls alternate Colors video but it's pretty straightforward you know how to adjust the Lights theme background color of a particular role so that I can clearly read all the way across which role you know which item is so if I'm looking for the dryer and I can't cross here and say okay will dryer is 30 amps I can locate fryer bicep on the amperage or I can locate it based upon the position and once you have completed this be sure to save a copy of this in the reason I say that is cuz in the future if you happen to add breaker Outlets name something that say you add an outlet in a new room or you add an additional light in the new room then you know you can go here instead of retyping this all the way over you just make that necessary addition and then free printed back out and stick it back in your breaker box I'm out stop attic grid lines instead of using beat coloring technique will be far easier to read his follow your line finger across the line of the dates and that way you know somebody comes along in the future they won't have to guess when this was last updated though clearly so they know if anything has changed between this date and the current date of whenever they're looking at it then they can reprint this out and put a updated label inside a breaker box so as you see I've completed the printout of the stuff that I was going to do on the computer with the labeling then I've covered it in mailing tape as my breaker panel is outside hopefully this will protect it against the weather and any other elements that may come in contact with the labels I have a copy of this saved on my computer so I can go in and print out additional labels in the future if needed if I need to make any adjustments I can make those adjustments on the print out and then print them back out again this process has helped you in identifying and labeling your breaker panel if you have any questions or comments please leave those in the comments section below if this video has helped you please give this video a thumbs up.","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"handyman/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel/#identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel","text":"","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"handyman/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel/#summary","text":"This video describes how I went about identifying the breakers in my breaker panel.

I'm going to show you how to go around and identify the outlets and the lights and which breaker they are connected to in your breaker panel. Thanks for tuning in. if you have not already please subscribe down in the button below. so when you go to do electrical work i.e. if you're changing out a light switch if a plug has an issue and you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to. in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself. the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the

When my place was quiet, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom. It was not loud. I removed the lid of the tank and to my suprise the water was at the top of the overflow tube. Definitely not a good sign. Not sure how long it had that slow leak, but I wanted to fix it before it got worse. I immediately shut off the water to the toilet to prevent any more water from being wasted. I have other bathrooms that I was able to use, so I was not concerned with this one leaking. However, if you only have one toilet and choose to turn the water off, you will need to turn it on after each flush so that it can refill. I'll share with you the 8 steps that I took to replace the fill valve on a toilet. 1) Gather The Tools Needed In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional) 2) Shut Off The Water Before you do anything, turn off the water. If you do not turn off the water before disconnecting the hoses or the fill valve, then you will flood your bathroom. To turn off the water, you can turn it off at the shut off valve on the left side of the toilet. If you do not have a shut off valve next to the toilet, then you will have to turn off the water to the entire home. This shut off valve could be located either outside or in the basement of the home. Once you have located the shut off valve, turn the knob to the right until it stops. 3) Remove the Water Remove the lid from the toilet tank (aka the back of the toilet). Flush the toilet and hold the lever down until most or all of the water runs out. Then you will need to remove the remaining water using one of the following methods: use a towel to soak up the water and wring it out in the bowl or sink allow the water to evaporate (the method I chose); this may take a couple of weeks to happen Jump to step 5 and replace a bucket below the fill valve opening before you unscrew it 4) Purchase Replacement Parts You will need to get a replacement fill valve. I bought a universal one, similar to the one pictured above. It has the same size fitting that connects to the water supply line. I also bought a replacement supply line. You do not have to do this. However, in the past 4 years, I have replaced almost all of the working parts of this toilet. Thus going ahead to replace the supply line as I do not know how long ago it was replaced. 5) Remove Old Fill Valve and Supply Line I disconnected the supply line from the water line and the fill valve. You may have to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the line. If the water line (that is the pipe that comes out of the wall) has Teflon tape on it, you will want to remove it at this time. Teflon tape is white, but pay be discolored depending on how long it has been on the fitting. Then I removed the fill valve from the tank, by removing the nut that is located on the bottom side of the tank. I was kinda suprised that this had not started leaking sooner. If you notice at the bottom of this valve, the rubber gasket has significantly warped to the point that it was no longer in its original shape. 6) Install New Fill Valve and Supply Line The fill valve that I purchased, has an adjustable height. Per the instructions listed on the box, I the fill valve needs to be 3 inches higher than the overflow tube. Following the instructions on the box, I adjusted the height of the valve to the approximate height that it needed to be. Do not use pilers or tools when tightening plastic parts. Do not use pilers or tools when tightening plastic parts. I say this twice because it really is important. The reason being is that you risk stripping or breaking the plastic parts. Plastic parts are usually designed to be hand-tightened only. If you break a plastic part, there is a chance that you will not be able to buy the broken part by itself, thus wasting money. What I did not realize until after the fact, was that the fill valve that I removed also had an adjustable height. Coincidentally, I set the new fill valve to the same height as the old fill valve that I removed. Before installing the new supply line, put on new Teflon tape. The reason that the Teflon tape is used to fill the gap that may exist between two connections or fittings. It is especially recommended that it be used on metal to metal fittings as they may leak of the rubber gasket is not seated properly. I only put the Teflon tape on the metal fittings. However, you can use it on the plastic fittings as well. 7) Turn On The Water Once you have checked and double checked the connections, slowly turn on the water. If you turn on the water slowly, then you are less likely to have a flood if a leak springs. Furthermore, if you turn the water knob 5 times and then find a leak, you have to turn it in the opposite direction 5 times to stop the water. Flush the toilet several times to make sure that the fill valve works as it should. 8) Adjust the Fill Rate This particular fill value has adjustable knobs for the tank water level and the bowl water level. Be sure to adjust these accordingly so that you are not wasting water by overfilling. Conclusion This was a rather quick replacement. In total, it took about an hour to complete. Part of that was having to walk back and forth to get tools and supplies. Also testing repeatedly to make sure that it works as it should.","title":"8 Steps to Replace A Toilet Fill Valve"},{"location":"handyman/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve/#1-gather-the-tools-needed","text":"In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional)","title":"1) Gather The Tools Needed"},{"location":"handyman/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve/#2-shut-off-the-water","text":"Before you do anything, turn off the water.

Then I removed the fill valve from the tank, by removing the nut that is located on the bottom side of the tank. I was kinda suprised that this had not started leaking sooner.

What I did not realize until after the fact, was that the fill valve that I removed also had an adjustable height. Coincidentally, I set the new fill valve to the same height as the old fill valve that I removed. Before installing the new supply line, put on new Teflon tape. The reason that the Teflon tape is used to fill the gap that may exist between two connections or fittings. It is especially recommended that it be used on metal to metal fittings as they may leak of the rubber gasket is not seated properly. I only put the Teflon tape on the metal fittings.

This bedroom did not have a ceiling fan originally, just a standard light fixture. Remove the Existing Fixture The removal was fairly easy. To begin, I had the customer turn off the power to the fixture. Come to find out, the entire room was on a single breaker. I confirmed using a non-contact voltage tester that the circuit no longer had power. Next was the removal of the cover plate and the disconnecting of the wires that powered the fan and light. Confirm Fan Rated Junction Box Next step was to confirm that a junction box, that was rating for a ceiling fan was already installed. This is what the junction box looked like. This is a newer style of junction box that is in contact with the joist on the bottom and side of the joist. Normally the junction box is only in contact with the bottom of the joist or is the retrofit style that extends to connect to the two nearby joists. This style of junction box, has the fan connected directly to the joist in the ceiling instead of connecting to the box and then the box to the joist. Install the Ceiling Fan Due to the height of the ceiling, a downrod was used to lower the ceiling fan closer to the living space of the room. Ceiling fans come with a downrod that is designed for a 8 foot ceiling. If you ceiling is greater than this height, then the use of a longer down rod is recommended. The length of the down rod depends on the height of the ceiling. From this point forward, the ceiling fan installation was straightforward and followed the manufacturer's instructions. This particular ceiling fan comes with some of the screws already in their final installation place. This reduces the chances of you putting a screw in the wrong part of the fan and the amount of plastic that has to be used to package the parts.

She requested that I perform the work. The initial discussion was about replacing a shrub, but expanded into doing more. As you can see, couple of the bushes had died and had been overtaken by weeds and grass. Per the conversation with the customer, a lawn care company (I am not going to mention the name) sprayed something on the bushes that was supposed to help them, but instead resulted in some of them dying. In addition, grass had started to grow up inside of the bed. Customer had used plastic bags as a weed barrier when she initially set up the bed. Also the lawn care professional that the customer uses, would sometimes cut too close to the bed. As a result, some of the rocks would be launched into the yard, sidewalk, or other location that they should not be. I suggested that brick pavers be used as a barrier to prevent this from happening going forward as nobody would be willing to run over bricks with a lawn mower as it could potentially destroy the mower. For the weed control, I recommended that landscape fabric be put down to prevent or hinder future weeds from growing, and using more lava rock as a mulch for the bed. Materials Used Materials used for this project were: Brick pavers Lava rock Landscape fabric one bush/shrub Remove Old Landscaping The old landscaping was removed. This included a combination of leaves, lava rock, and the black plastic weed barrier. The plan was that the lava rock be separated from the other materials in the bed. However, that proved to be a bit more difficult in execution. The existing rock, leaves, and weeds were raked, shoveled, and placed onto a tarp. In addition, the dead bushes were removed. One of the bushes was replaced with a new one. Install New Landscaping Before the landscape fabric was installed, all purpose fertizilzer was used to help the existing and new plants. The living shrubs were left in place. Since they were left, the landscape fabric was installed and cut to fit around the existing bushes. This would allow for the greatest amount of coverage to prevent weeds and grass from showing up in the beds. The old landscaping was removed and placed on the tarp. As you can see from the picture above, the rocks were used to keep the fabric from blowing away, granted there was much wind during the project. Lock In The Pavers Each over the pavers were placed on a layer of fast setting concrete. This will help hold the pavers in place. Since the ground is mostly level, leveling the bricks did not take too much effort. In some areas, the ground was slightly higher. Those areas, were dug down using a shovel and pickaxe. Then the dirt was compacted down using a tamper to make sure it did not settle once the brick was placed on top of it. Once the pavers were in place, they were watered so that the concrete could set up. Because the concrete is directly on the ground, the concrete will soak up water from the ground, in addition to the rain water. I got the idea for the no dig border from watching a YouTube video . As I mentioned, I did have to do some digging in order to get the bricks as level as possible. In some spots, getting them level was not possbile as the ground sloped downward (for drainage).

The problem that I had is that I did not have anywhere to store the items so that they could properly dry out to be used in the firepit. Thus I built a firewood stand that would hold the wood until they were ready to be burned. What You Need Materials Needed 4 - 4 inch x 4 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 10.16 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated posts 3 - 4 inch x 2 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 5.08 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards 3 - 4 inch x 1 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 2.54 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards exterior or deck screws or nails spray paint All of the parts that are used to build the stand are not included as I took this picture in the process of unloading the materials. Tools Needed Saw - miter saw makes this easier, but circular saw works for this as well drill Cut The Pieces Vertical Posts I made my stand 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. To get this height, I cut the 4 inch x 4 inch posts in half. Horizontal Pieces I made the stand 4 feet (1.22 m) long by 2 feet (0.61 m) wide. I used 2 of the the 4 inch x 2 inch lumber cut at 4 feet, 4 feet, and then 2 feet. The remaining 4 x 2 will be used as cross braces between the outer pieces. The cross braces were placed at 16 on center. Slats I did not cut the slats until after I had completed the assembly. That way, they would be cut to fit the shelving that was used. I had some pallet wood on hand, so I was able to use that instead of using 1x4 wood. Paint The Pieces I painted the bottom and tops of the vertical posts with spray paint. Since I was placing the firewood stand directly in contact with the ground, I wanted some protection against the water that it would be in contact with. Paint is not necessary the best way to prevent the wood from rotting, but it does offer better protection than setting the posts directly on the ground. I went up about 1 foot from the bottom of the post and painted it as well. The reason that I did this because when water hits the ground, it may splash up on the side of the post. Having paint up this far will provide protection against this splashing. I had black spray paint already on hand, so I used it. Regardless of which paint that you use, make sure that you use exterior grade paint. Exterior grade paint will offer you the best protection for the wood. Assemble The Pieces For my setup, I made the top of the bottom shelf 1 foot (0.30 m) from the ground. This will allow for sufficient air flow for all of the wood that has been stacked on it. The top shelf is about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the top of the post. This will make sure that the items that are on the top do not easily roll off when they are stacked. Pieces were secured together with 3 inch decking screws. I mentioned in the materials list, you may use nails for this as well. Conclusion This project was simple and only took a couple of hours to complete. As you can see from the photo, if you need to make it bigger or smaller to fit your space, then you can change the size of the horizontal pieces as necessary. In my case, the first one that I built, was not big enough.

Come to find out, one of the wires had burned off on the contactor, which resulted in a hot house in August. Definitely not something good. Take a look at the video to see how I diagnosed and fixed the issue. Video Video Transcript ONE DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NEXT YOU'RE GONNA DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES THAT RUN TO THE CONTACTOR BECAUSE AFTER YOU GET ALL OF THE WIRES DISCONNECTED THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR FOR MY PARTICULAR SITUATION THE CONTACTOR HAD SCREWS ON THE CONNECTING POINT SOME OF THEM DID HAVE THESE WHAT I CALL QUICK CONNECTORS BUT OTHER ONES HAD SCREWS ON THEM SO FOR THOSE OF HOW THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CONTACTOR YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES FROM THE CONTACTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT ALRIGHT FOLKS SO I GOT MY NEW CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE OVER HERE AND MY OLD CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE HERE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE SCREW ON THIS ONE ACTUALLY I HAD TO SCREW IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THERE SO BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THAT I'M NOTICED SO ON THE TOP OF THIS ONE ACTUALLY YOU STICK THE WIRE IN WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD A CLAMP THAT YOU PUT A CONNECTOR ON IT AND THEN YOU PUT THAT CONNECTOR AROUND THE SCREW HEAD SO THE TOP IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE THE BOTTOM NOW WHERE YOU STICK THE WHOLE WIRE IN AND THEN YOU SCREW THE TO CLAMP IT DOWN ALL THE WAY ALSO THE SAME NUMBER OF PINS HERE LOOKS TO BE THERE'S EIGHT ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S EIGHT ON THE TOP HERE I ONLY HAD I BELIEVE THOSE TWO WIRES HERE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR ITSELF I WON'T BE USING ALL OF THOSE PINS SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE WIRES AND THIS ONE ALSO IS ENCLOSED SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE COIL ON THIS ONE FROM BOTH SIDES SO BUT YOU CAN ON THIS ONE AND THE REASON BEING IS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TOOK ACCOUNT THAT HEY BUGS CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THIS THING AND CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THEY ACTUALLY SEAL IT UP ENTIRELY SO ALL THIS MECHANICAL STUFF LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE IT'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS HOWEVER YOU CAN TAKE THESE TWO SCREWS OFF AND THIS PLAY TO COME UP AND THEN IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS INSIDE UNDERNEATH THIS COVER HERE SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW CONTACTOR AND THE OLD CONTACTOR AND ONE OTHER DIFFERENCE THEY DID NOT HAVE IF YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THIS ONE IS RATED AT 25 AMPS AND THIS ONE IS RATED AT 30 SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME RATING BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PART JUST THE WRITING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO AS YOU SEE IS STILL OPERATING WITH A 24 VOLT COIL LIKE THIS ONE IS HERE AND SO IT'S ALSO A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AND BE SURE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SCREWS BECAUSE THIS THING DOES HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND TRYING TO FIND THE SCREWS THAT MATCH OR WILL FIT ME HOLES THAT IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OR CONDENSER IS PRETTY DIFFICULT I'M YOU COULD USE ONE OF THE OTHER SCREWS AND PUT IT THERE BUT AGAIN THE HASSLE OF GOING THROUGH THE STORE AND TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER SCREW TO REPLACE THAT ONE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO ONCE YOU GET THE OLD ONE OUT YOU CAN PUT THE NEW ONE IN AND PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN IS THE REVERSE STEPS OF TAKING THE OLD ONE OUT AND MY PARTICULAR SCENARIO I HAD WIRES THAT BURNED I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS JUST AN ARC OR JUST CORROSION OR MAYBE EVEN A CRITTER OR SOMETHING GOT INTO THE EAR AND SHORTER THINGS OUT BUT NONETHELESS THE WIRES WERE BURNED AS I SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN THE VIDEO SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT MORE WIRE CUT OFF THE BURNT SECTION IDEALLY THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WIRE LEFT IN HERE IF NOT YOU MAY HAVE TO WHAT THEY CALL KIND OF LIKE PIGTAIL SO YOU PUT IN A NEW WIRE OF A LONGER LINK AND JOIN THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RESIZE IT BACK TO THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH BUT IN MY CASE I HAVE PLENTY OF WIRE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND SO THAT ADDING ADDITIONAL WIRE WAS NOT NECESSARY I WAS JUST ABLE TO CUT OFF WHAT I HAD AND WIRE IT IN THE CONTACTOR THAT I'M USING DOES NOT HAVE THE QUICK CONNECTORS ON IT OR REQUIRED THAT THEY BE USED AND SO WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WAS TO STICK THE CONNECTOR I'M EXCUSE ME TO STICK THE WIRE INTO THE HOLE AND THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW DOWN AND THAT HELD THE WIRE IN PLACE TO THE CONNECTOR SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT QUICK CONNECTOR ON THERE ANYMORE ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING CONNECTED YOU'LL NEED TO REARRANGE THE WIRES AND SECURE THEM BACK INSIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE OR THE PANEL IDEALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER IF YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES ORIGINALLY BEFORE I PULL THIS PANEL UP ALL THE WIRES WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER IN A LARGE BUNDLE WITH A ZIP TIE SO TRY TO PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE YOU START MESSING WITH IT THAT WAY YOU CAN ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAVE THE ENTIRE WIRE SET WRAPPED IN BUNDLES I MEAN EXCUSE ME WRAPPED IN ZIP WITH A SINGLE ZIP TIE LIKE IT WAS BEFORE AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING FITS THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE I STARTED MESSING WITH THINGS AND THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE CROSSED OVER OR ALL THOSE TYPE OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHORT OUT THE SYSTEM OR CAUSE YOURSELF FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT YOU OR A TECHNICIAN MAY HAVE TO FIX ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE WIRES IN PLACE AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO THEN GO FLIP ON THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS AS IT SHOULD ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE CONDITIONING AGAIN YOU WANT TO DO THIS BEFORE YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON BECAUSE IF YOU TEST IT AFTER YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON AND SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER BACK OFF WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT NOW I KNOW ON SOME SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CONTACTOR AND THE CAPACITOR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE FAN OFF AND SOME OTHER COMPONENTS SO IN THAT CASE IF YOUR SYSTEM IS SET UP THAT WAY YOU'LL NEED TO PUT THOSE ITEMS BACK ON BEFORE TESTING BECAUSE IF THE FAN IS NOT SECURED AND YOU SWITCH IT ON THE FAM MAY DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE UNIT AND ALSO BE A HAZARD TO ANYBODY THAT WOULD BE STANDING NEARBY IF IT WERE TO COME APART FROM THE SYSTEM ONCE YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE THEN YOU CAN PUT THE PANEL AND SCREWS BACK IN PLACE AND THAT WILL BE IT ALSO WHILE YOU'RE AT IT YOU CAN CHECK THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CONDITION COAL SUCH AS THE LINES THAT RUN IN AND OUT AS WELL AS THE WIRING THAT GOES IN AND OUT TO THAT UNIT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO DO THAT SINCE YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO DO REPAIRS ON THAT TO LOOK IT OVER AS WELL AND I'VE BEEN MENTIONING IT EARLIER IN THE VIDEO BUT IF YOU HAVE BUGS OR ANYTHING INSIDE THE PLACE WHERE THE CONTACTOR AND CAPACITOR ARE TRY TO CLEAN THOSE OUT THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THOSE ARE THE CULPRITS FOR YOUR CAPACITOR OR CONTACTOR TO STOP WORKING THEY SOMETIMES WILL CRAWL IN THERE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE CAPACITOR THEY ACTUALLY CRAWL INSIDE OF THE CAPACITOR AND WHEN THE CAPACITOR GOES TO SWITCH ON IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SWITCH ON BECAUSE THAT BUG MIGHT BE BLOCKING THE MECHANICAL PORTIONS OF THAT FROM MOVING AND SIMILAR FOR THE CAPACITOR IF THERE'S A BUG OR SOME KIND OF ANIMAL IN THERE AND IT'S TOUCHING THE YOU KNOW TWO MORE POINTS OF THE CAPACITOR AND THAT CAPACITOR SWITCHES ON IT CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE THAT CAPACITOR TO SHORT OUT BECAUSE THAT OTHER ANIMAL IS ACTUALLY GIVEN A PATH BETWEEN TWO OF THE TOOL BOARD THE TERMINALS ON THE CAPACITOR SO AGAIN CLEANING OUT THE BUGS COBWEBS ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE ALSO TAKE NOTE IF THERE ARE ANY CHEWED WIRES BECAUSE IF THERE SHOOT WIRES THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE A RAT OR RODENT PROBLEM AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL HOPEFULLY YOU'VE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT AND ARE ABLE TO APPLY THIS IN THE

DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NEXT YOU'RE GONNA DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES THAT RUN TO THE CONTACTOR BECAUSE AFTER YOU GET ALL OF THE WIRES DISCONNECTED THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR FOR MY PARTICULAR SITUATION THE CONTACTOR HAD SCREWS ON THE CONNECTING POINT SOME OF THEM DID HAVE THESE WHAT I CALL QUICK CONNECTORS BUT OTHER ONES HAD SCREWS ON THEM SO FOR THOSE OF HOW THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CONTACTOR YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES FROM THE CONTACTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT ALRIGHT FOLKS SO I GOT MY NEW CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE OVER HERE AND MY OLD CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE HERE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE SCREW ON THIS ONE ACTUALLY I HAD TO SCREW IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THERE SO BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THAT I'M NOTICED SO ON THE TOP OF THIS ONE ACTUALLY YOU STICK THE WIRE IN WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD A CLAMP THAT YOU PUT A CONNECTOR ON IT AND THEN YOU PUT THAT CONNECTOR AROUND THE SCREW HEAD SO THE TOP IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE THE BOTTOM NOW WHERE YOU STICK THE WHOLE WIRE IN AND THEN YOU SCREW THE TO CLAMP IT DOWN ALL THE WAY ALSO THE SAME NUMBER OF PINS HERE LOOKS TO BE THERE'S EIGHT ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S EIGHT ON THE TOP HERE I ONLY HAD I BELIEVE THOSE TWO WIRES HERE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR ITSELF I WON'T BE USING ALL OF THOSE PINS SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE WIRES AND THIS ONE ALSO IS ENCLOSED SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE COIL ON THIS ONE FROM BOTH SIDES SO BUT YOU CAN ON THIS ONE AND THE REASON BEING IS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TOOK ACCOUNT THAT HEY BUGS CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THIS THING AND CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THEY ACTUALLY SEAL IT UP ENTIRELY SO ALL THIS MECHANICAL STUFF LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE IT'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS HOWEVER YOU CAN TAKE THESE TWO SCREWS OFF AND THIS PLAY TO COME UP AND THEN IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS INSIDE UNDERNEATH THIS COVER HERE SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW CONTACTOR AND THE OLD CONTACTOR AND ONE OTHER DIFFERENCE THEY DID NOT HAVE IF YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THIS ONE IS RATED AT 25 AMPS AND THIS ONE IS RATED AT 30 SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME RATING BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PART JUST THE WRITING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO AS YOU SEE IS STILL OPERATING WITH A 24 VOLT COIL LIKE THIS ONE IS HERE AND SO IT'S ALSO A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AND BE SURE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SCREWS BECAUSE THIS THING DOES HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND TRYING TO FIND THE SCREWS THAT MATCH OR WILL FIT ME HOLES THAT IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OR CONDENSER IS PRETTY DIFFICULT I'M YOU COULD USE ONE OF THE OTHER SCREWS AND PUT IT THERE BUT AGAIN THE HASSLE OF GOING THROUGH THE STORE AND TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER SCREW TO REPLACE THAT ONE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO ONCE YOU GET THE OLD ONE OUT YOU CAN PUT THE NEW ONE IN AND PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN IS THE REVERSE STEPS OF TAKING THE OLD ONE OUT AND MY PARTICULAR SCENARIO I HAD WIRES THAT BURNED I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS JUST AN ARC OR JUST CORROSION OR MAYBE EVEN A CRITTER OR SOMETHING GOT INTO THE EAR AND SHORTER THINGS OUT BUT NONETHELESS THE WIRES WERE BURNED AS I SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN THE VIDEO SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT MORE WIRE CUT OFF THE BURNT SECTION IDEALLY THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WIRE LEFT IN HERE IF NOT YOU MAY HAVE TO WHAT THEY CALL KIND OF LIKE PIGTAIL SO YOU PUT IN A NEW WIRE OF A LONGER LINK AND JOIN THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RESIZE IT BACK TO THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH BUT IN MY CASE I HAVE PLENTY OF WIRE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND SO THAT ADDING ADDITIONAL WIRE WAS NOT NECESSARY I WAS JUST ABLE TO CUT

contactor on my air conditioner after the last one had a burned wire on it. I discuss the parts of a contactor and how it works. Check out the video! Video Video Transcript what's going on fellow engineers this is Kenny and thanks for checking out the Almost Engineer Channel and in this video I'm going to talk about a contactor this thing right here and how it works stay tuned [Music] alright so this is the contactor that I took off of my HVAC unit and this is the old one so I just wanted to talk about what a contactor is and what it does and how it works and so there are some elements on here that are not exactly right with a modern contactor this one is probably original to the HVAC unit that I have so there are some differences that I notice between the new one and the old one alright folks so I got my new contactor which is this one over here and my old contactor which is this one here for the most part they are pretty much the same the screw on this one actually I had to screw it all the way out to get the lead out of there so but there are some significant differences that I'm noticing so on the top of this one actually you stick the wire in whereas this one had a clamp that you put a connector on it and then you put that connector around the screw head so the top is essentially like the bottom now where you stick the whole wire in and then you screw to clamp it down all the way also the same number of pins here looks to be there's eight on the bottom and there's eight on the top here I only had I believe it was two wires here and this one also is enclosed so as you can see you can see the coil on this one both sides so but you can on this one and the reason being is somebody actually took the counts that hey bugs can actually get into this thing and cause problems so what they do now is they actually seal it up entirely so all this mechanical stuff like this right here is not exposed to the elements however you can take these two screws off and this play to come up and then it will look just like this inside underneath this cover here so that's the difference between the new contactor and the old contactor and so with this particular contactor unit so we'll start off with the label of course and here you'll see is rated for 25 amps and it's also a 24 volt coil and so the contactor that I put on is actually rated for 30 amps but it's also 24 volts and so what the amperage has to do is that it has a maximum capacity you know you see it as 25 so if you try to push 30 through it more likely you'll have a problem and I think that kind of helped in some cases the failure of this one and so if you see right here where this screw is you'll see this plastic here is actually burned and cracked it actually broke off what happened there was it looks like the wire on it actually broke burned some kind of way I don't know if something got into it and caused it to short out or what the case was but this is the connector that was on it after the fact from the wire way it burned off at so and as you see this screw is actually brown so I don't know if that is the indicator of the problem that was going on with it because it should not have been brown it should be fight the rest of these you know silver we're not so just a walk overview of everything so on the bottom here have pins you can have these push connectors that go on these pins here at the bottom then you also have these two terminal screws and so you can stick the wire in this gap here tighten the screw down same thing on this side and then on the top it's a different setup because they actually use these connectors that go over the screw and then you tighten screw down on the connector instead of sticking the wire directly in so that's that side and this is what is known as a single pole breaker and there's also a thing called a double pole breaker so the pole is the thing that actually moves so this one here is not seized up it does move but it only has one pole which is this side so this right side here as you see there's a metal bar that goes from top to bottom that means this side is always hot this side is the side that switches so we turn on the AC U and it this goes in and it connects the bottom which is where the power comes in that to the top which is where it goes out to the compressor and the fan on the condenser unit and completes the circuit so sue Evans so fan is running but there's no I don't hear the compressor running too and so that's how that works now how does this move back and forth well on this side and on this side you have these two connectors as well these since this is a 24 volt coil these connect to the 24 volt wires that come from the inner handler that is on the building interior so when there is a call for cooling the thermostat connects the wires inside of it and that signal goes to the air handler the air handler triggers that same since that signal out to the condenser through one side and then back out the other therefore you complete the circuit and when you complete the circuit on here this pushes in and completes the 240 circuit so if you ever heard me discuss about relays before this is essentially the same concept as a relay you have a voltage of one type in this case would be in 24 volts controlling a voltage of a higher type which in this case is 240 volts that's 120 on the Left 120 on the right which equals 240 now this one may or may not say it I do not believe it does but it is designed for 240 but it doesn't say it the unit itself says 240 the actual conditioner unit says 240 on it so and then once you remove the 24 volts so the thermostat says hey I've reached the set temperature shut off so that means the thermostat disconnects the connection between the air handler and it and so as a result that same connection is also removed so the incoming 24 volts is removed from here and thus there's nothing on this side to go back so this connector in the middle here will spring up and there is a spring underneath it as you can kind of see right there there's a spring there and so that comes back up to disconnect the connector connection between the top of the bottom so that covers how a contactor works hopefully you've learned a little bit and are able to apply this in the future if you have any questions about the contactor or relay please hit me up and drop a comment in the comment section below also please check out me on social media on Instagram and Twitter at almost Engr and check out my website the

Table of Contents Background Solution Technology Checking Job Log Create System Service on Ubuntu 20.04 Remove System Service on Ubuntu 20.04 Background My router would occasionally disconnect any of the wireless clients that were connected to it. Since I have wired and wireless devices connected, some of the time I would not know that the wifi had stopped working until my phone or laptop wouldn't connect or I noticed that a automation did not trigger when it should have. Solution After updating to the latest DD-WRT firmware, the problem persisted. Given that I work building automations to improve business processes, I decided that I would build and automation that would connect to the router\u2019s web interface and see if there are any wireless clients connected to it. If there are no connected wireless clients, then there is a great chance that the wifi process that authenticates clients has crashed. As a result, the process would need to be restarted and the easiest way to restart the process would be to reboot the router. The Technology This solution uses Selenium Webdriver to connect to the DD-WRT router web interface. I built this using .NET Core, but it could be done on Python, Java, or one of the other platforms that Webdriver works on. I have it set up on server that is always running and it runs as a system service.

One of the recommendations to achieve this is to walk at least 10,000 steps per day, which equates to about 5 miles. Make note that with this recommendation, that you do not have to get all 5 miles done in a single setting or activity. The problem that I noticed was that I work a 9-5 desk job, and there\u2019s really no walking involved for that line of work. After researching and hearing about the consequences of sitting or lack of walking, I decided to make some adjustments to my habits to get more steps in per day. I have a phone and activity tracker that track the number of daily steps. On a typical day where I went from home to work to home without stopping anywhere else, I would log about 2,500 to 3,500 steps per day. That is way below the recommended 10,000 steps per day. So here\u2019s how I chose to try to gain more steps per day without hitting the treadmill or park. Hack 1) Park In The First Empty Spot If you really want some steps, park in the space that is closest to the road and not the store or restaurant that you are going into. Now personally I do not try to park at the door or ride around for finding the closest spot and I also do not park at the very end of the parking lot. Usually, I'll park in between the road and the store. The rule that I do follow is that I do not drive down more than two (2) aisles when looking for a parking space. Not only does riding around looking for the closest parking space waste gas, it also and reduce the number of steps that you get. This adds about 100-200 steps per occurrence. Hack 2) No Drive-Thrus If I go out to eat and the restaurant has a drive through, I skip it and go inside to the counter. Through trail and error from doing this, I have found that by going inside instead of going into the drive-thru, I\u2019m actually able to get in and out faster than those in the drive through. If you believe my experience is flawed, there is a survey that was done by QSR Magazine that stated that the drive-thru line wait time increased from 2013 to 2014 by 40 seconds. In addition, sitting in the drive through wastes gas unless you are driving an electric, hybrid, or auto-stop vehicle. Next time that you go to a fast-food restaurant, as you walk into the restaurant and take note of the last car that is in the drive through line and see if you walk out of the restaurant before the car gets out of the drive thru. This adds about 100-150 steps per occurrence. Hack 3) Take The Stairs If you have the option to take the stairs or the elevator, the default I recommend is to take the stairs. However, if there are no stairs then take the escalator and walk down it. Now if you work or live in a tall building and cannot take all the stairs to your floor, then go as many flights of steps that you can tolerate and take the elevator the rest of the way. This adds about 10-30 steps per floor. Hack 4) When You Gotta Go, Go Further At my job, the restroom is about 20 steps from my desk. The next closest restroom in the office building is about 75 steps, including a flight of stairs (see Hack 3). Just by going to another floor, that\u2019s almost 3 times the number of steps. Round trip, that is about 150 steps and traversing two flights of stairs. If your home has multiple stories with a bathroom on each, then when you have to use the bathroom, go to the bathroom on a floor that you are not on. If your home is single story, then go to the bathroom that is furthest from you or make multiple trips to and from where you are before you go. This adds about 110 steps at work and 40 at home each time that I go. Hack 5) Drink More Water I know what you are thinking\u2026 water has nothing to do with steps. Actually it does though. By drinking more water, you will go to the bathroom more often. When you go to the bathroom more often, then you can apply Hack 4 to get more steps. Before using this hack, I would probably go to the restroom once, sometimes twice, while at work. Now that I drink more water, I go at least two or more times per day. Each time I go, I apply Hack 3 and 4. Hack 6) Set Reminders, Pedometer Alerts I have a pedometer that I wear on my wrist. If it does not detect that I have taken any steps within the last hour, it will buzz and remind me to get some steps in. When it does go off and I am at work, I will get up to use the restroom (Hack 4), get some water (Hack 5), or talk to a coworker in person. If I am on a conference call when it goes off, I will stand up, stretch, and take some steps in my cubicle. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Hack 7) Walk Around Your Car Or House Before You Go In One day, I was waiting at a red light located near a fire station. I noticed some of the firefighters went around to the back of the fire house on the right side. After about 15 seconds, some firefighters came from the back of the firehouse on the left side. However, it was not the group that had gone around on the right. About another 10 more seconds, the group I saw that went around on the right side was coming around on the left side and it occurred to me that they were doing laps. Firefighters cannot leave the firehouse while on shift, because they have to respond when a call comes in, they ran laps around the firehouse as their physical activity. Applying this same strategy, I will sometimes walk around by car before getting in it or walk around my house before going inside. During the walk around the car, I pay attention to the tires and look for any scratch marks or dings that may have appears. When walking around the house, I look at the roof and exterior to see if anything significant has changed. This adds about 25 steps when walking around the car and about 150 steps when walking around the house per occurrence. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Conclusion By doing a combination of these hacks, I've been able to increase my minimal step range from 2500-3500 range to the 4000-5000 range. I know you think that is not a lot, but keep in mind that every step counts. Hopefully, this has inspired you to take small steps in adding steps to your day.

Sometimes, I do find myself getting stuck on building an automation. When it comes to programming, you can do an online search and find an example or the exact code for the thing that you are trying to program but cannot figure out how. However, there are times where the answer cannot be found on Stack Overflow. I know every programmer that is reading this probably had a facial reaction or yelled an expletive to the previous sentence, but it is true. I will admit, Stack Overflow does have a lot of the answers to the most common routine programming and computer questions, but there are still unknown unknowns that it does not have the answers to. In my younger programming days (you better not be laughing), I would keep trying different ways of accomplishing the programming task. This, continue working on it until you get it right approach, would work some of the time because I would become so focused on the program until I got it right. Things have changed since then. New technologies have taken over (Python gasp). New programmers are not following the common standards or the specific language, like starting Java functions with an upper case letter, or just coming up with their own standards and wonder why other programmers do not want to touch what they have created. One: You Get More Work Done With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking. I put those JIRA tasks and the amount of time I spend on each task on my Outlook calendar, so that I can get a visual of how much time that I have spent on a given task in comparison to my week. By combining the visual from Outlook calendar and the Scrum Board from JIRA, I realized that I was completing fewer tasks in less time when I got stuck with a programming issue. Those of you familiar with Burn Down Rates and how it can impact a project will probably understand this the best. Staring at the round peg to see how you can get it in the square hole will not make the solution come by easier. If you know that you have other square pegs to place into square holes, then you can work on those and come back to the round peg and square hole. I have even completed lower priority tasks before higher priority tasks because I knew that I had or could reach the solution to that lower priority task faster than the higher priority task. Some project managers may balk at this approach. If they do, my recommendation would be to reference your Burn Down Rate so that they see that you are completing more tasks, although it may not be the high priority ones. Two: The Numbers Favor You The more that you are able to complete in given amount of time, the more valuable and productive that you appear. If your manager is only concerned with the numbers and not the science or reasoning behind the numbers, then this tip is great for you. Managers that only look at the numbers and not the data that supports the numbers think that things are going great because more tasks are getting completed. However, if you have 10 tasks that are to be completed within a sprint, and 5 of those are defects from crappy done work in a previous sprint, then you are really only completing 5 new items instead of 10, thus 50% new feature rate. Solely looking at the numbers may not convey this point depending on how it is presented. If your manager actually wants to know the science or reasoning behind the numbers, this will probably get you on the Naughty List. When I work on an automation, I design it in a way so that unless something major changes (e.g. API changes, new elements on a page, conversion to new technology), that automation will work correctly and has the intelligence to handle minor issues that may occur. That way I\u2019m truly completing the tasks assigned and not repeatedly patching defects or making small adjustments, thus reducing the number of new automations that I can complete. Three: Less Mental Fatigue and Strain Since I was not so dedicated with completing one single task before moving on to the next, I realized that I was able to complete the work without being as mentally drained at the end of the day. Programming does not require much physical effort as most programmers either stand or sit in one spot while they do their work. However the ability to be able to assemble things in a logical fashion takes a lot of mental effort. Combine that with not being able to complete a given task, in other words doing the same thing over and getting the same results, and you will have a high level of frustration and a low sense of accomplishment. Conclusion This article was written with programming and technology examples included. However do note that the main points can be applied to anything that you encounter. For instance: Cannot figure out why the tv will not turn on? Go listen to the radio. Later, check the power cord, surge protector if it is plugged into one, and replace the remote batteries. Cannot figure out why the ice maker is not making ice? Go buy some ice. Later, check to see if the water line is connected and that it has power. Worse case by another fridge. Cannot figure out why that person cut you off in traffic and did not use his or her turn signal? Let them go on down the road. Then pray for that driver\u2019s bad habit be removed from them and continue on to your destination.","title":"3 Benefits of Doing Something Different When Stuck"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-06-13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/#one-you-get-more-work-done","text":"With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking.

That is not a fair, nor equal comparison by no means. The comparisons mentioned below are for the sake of illustration and for laughter. Background I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media. A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant. Before this image went viral, I found a way to save that additional $4 on food that I'm not even going to eat. Believe it or not, what I am about to share with you, I learned it from gardening. Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it. Now gentlemen, these steps will only work if you have a greater and diverse taste pallet than your lady. Do not be afraid to become diverse when it comes to food. So here's how I keep a woman from eating off my plate... Step 1: Learn What She Does Not Eat Or Is Allergic To The first year I got serious about gardening, I planted a combination of fruits and vegetables that I wanted to eat during the growing season. This resulted in me caring for bunch of green leaves and no fruit. Talking about disappointment... it was major. So after doing some research about squirrels, I found that their diet consists of mostly of nuts and small fruit. I had to make a choice... grow the food that squirrels and I both love so much and fight them to eat it, or grow something that I love and that the squirrels hate. Since I'm responsible for maintaining the garden, growing what the squirrels did not eat became the priority. In the end, I did not have to protect my garden with Fort Knox security because they were not attracted to what was in the garden. To apply this step to women, find out what she does not eat or is allergic to. There are several ways that you can figure this out. Just ask. She may tell you everything. She may tell you only part of the list. Whatever she tells you, be sure to make note of it. Check the pantry. That's right... go in her pantry or cabinets. You have to decide whether you want to be discrete about it or not. If you do not see beans in her cabinet, that's probably on the Do Not Eat List. Watch what she eats. If y'all go to a restaurant that is known for burgers, and she orders chicken, then there is a great chance that she does not eat beef. If she orders French Fries with Ranch, then she probably does not eat ketchup. If she orders the vegan shrimp tacos, then she probably does not eat actual meat. Step 2: When Eating, Order The Items You Have Identified From Step 1 With my knowledge of the squirrel diet, I revamped my garden to include jalapeno peppers, lettuce, and turnip greens. After planting these items, I rarely saw a squirrel near the garden or in the yard. Why? They weren't attracted to what was there. Thus staying away and looking else where. Now there are times where Step 2 may not fully work. That's when you still order what you want, but modify it accordingly. For instance... You like chicken, your lady likes chicken, and your lady hates BBQ sauce. Pour BBQ sauce on the chicken. Problem solved. You order a salad, your lady likes salads, your lady also likes Ranch dressing, but your lady does not eat Ranch dressing on her salad. Order a salad with Ranch dressing... and coat it thoroughly. Problem solved. You go to a seafood restaurant, your lady likes shrimp and does not like spicy food. Order shrimp and cover it with hot sauce. Problem solved. If she always orders Papa Johns', then you order Domino's or Pizza Hut. Problem solved. Step 3: Check The Reaction When squirrels are scouting the area, they will look and stand on their hind legs or climb a tree to get a better field of view. When they cannot find what they think they saw, they continue digging and looking and digging and looking. Eventually they will give up and look elsewhere for food. Before a woman swipes... I mean steals food off of your plate, she will do an analysis of what you have on your plate with or without your prior knowledge. Think of it like Robocop walking down the street and he is analyzing each person's face to see if he or she is the individual matching a suspects description. Instead of faces being scanned, it is the food on your plate. Scanning baked beans... will cause gas... skipping. Scanning potato salad... does not have boiled eggs... skipping. Scanning mac and cheese... it has raisins in it... skipping. Scanning chicken wings... confirming it has lemon pepper seasoning... TAKE IT, TAKE IT. Now if she scans your entire plate and does not find anything that appeals to her taste buds, she will make a comment about that fact. You may hear one or more of the following phrases accompanied with an unpleasant facial expression: \"I don't see how you eat that stuff.\" \"I don't need none of that.\" \"You know eating insert food name is not good for you.\" If you hear any of the preceding phrases or something similar, you sir have successfully saved your food from being stolen. Conclusion Ladies, you have to understand that there is nothing more satisfying to a man than to be able to order what he wants and knowing that he will be able to clean the entire plate. When a lady eats from a man's plate, he will not get full because of the fact she has reduced the portion size. Thus he has to venture to the kitchen or some other place for a midnight snack because he was deprived of calories. As previously mentioned, these steps can only be achieved if you have a greater diversity in your taste pallet than your lady. Lacking this essential trait, means that you will never be successful eating your entire plate if she is around. These are just my thoughts.","title":"Squirrels Taught Me About Women and Food"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-07-03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food/#background","text":"I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media. A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant. Before this image went viral, I found a way to save that additional $4 on food that I'm not even going to eat. Believe it or not, what I am about to share with you, I learned it from gardening. Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it. Now gentlemen, these steps will only work if you have a greater and diverse taste pallet than your lady. Do not be afraid to become diverse when it comes to food. So here's how I keep a woman from eating off my plate...","title":"Background"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-07-03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food/#step-1-learn-what-she-does-not-eat-or-is-allergic-to","text":"The first year I got serious about gardening, I planted a combination of fruits and vegetables that I wanted to eat during the growing season. This resulted in me caring for bunch of green leaves and no fruit. Talking about disappointment... it was major. So after doing some research about squirrels, I found that their diet consists of mostly of nuts and small fruit. I had to make a choice... grow the food that squirrels and I both love so much and fight them to eat it, or grow something that I love and that the squirrels hate. Since I'm responsible for maintaining the garden, growing what the squirrels did not eat became the priority. In the end, I did not have to protect my garden with Fort Knox security because they were not attracted to what was in the garden. To apply this step to women, find out what she does not eat or is allergic to. There are several ways that you can figure this out. Just ask. She may tell you everything. She may tell you only part of the list. Whatever she tells you, be sure to make note of it. Check the pantry. That's right... go in her pantry or cabinets. You have to decide whether you want to be discrete about it or not. If you do not see beans in her cabinet, that's probably on the Do Not Eat List. Watch what she eats. If y'all go to a restaurant that is known for burgers, and she orders chicken, then there is a great chance that she does not eat beef. If she orders French Fries with Ranch, then she probably does not eat ketchup. If she orders the vegan shrimp tacos, then she probably does not eat actual meat.","title":"Step 1: Learn What She Does Not Eat Or Is Allergic To"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-07-03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food/#step-2-when-eating-order-the-items-you-have-identified-from-step-1","text":"With my knowledge of the squirrel diet, I revamped my garden to include jalapeno peppers, lettuce, and turnip greens. After planting these items, I rarely saw a squirrel near the garden or in the yard. Why? They weren't attracted to what was there. Thus staying away and looking else where. Now there are times where Step 2 may not fully work. That's when you still order what you want, but modify it accordingly. For instance... You like chicken, your lady likes chicken, and your lady hates BBQ sauce. Pour BBQ sauce on the chicken. Problem solved. You order a salad, your lady likes salads, your lady also likes Ranch dressing, but your lady does not eat Ranch dressing on her salad. Order a salad with Ranch dressing... and coat it thoroughly.

Therefore, I took 28 days to see what would happen. Was I trying to overachieve by doing more than what was necessary? Nah. Initially, it was going to be 21 Days of Prayer that my church. It was coincidence that part of the 21 Days of Prayer was overlapped by the 21 Days of Miraculous Meditation done by Deepak Chopra. Combine this with the dating/relationship issues that I had and the certification course that was about to start for the next 4 weeks and it was almost like I walking into a season of turmoil. So what habits did I choose to do for this season that I saw myself entering? I have about 15-20 items on the habits list. I am not going to cover them all and the impact that they had as this post would be unreasonably long. Habit 1: Ride with the Radio Off Not the volume turned all the way down, but I actually pressed the power button and turned it off. In order to not make things awkward when I had passengers, I did turn the radio on while they were riding. Once they got out, radio went back off. 1) You may more attention to what is going on around you while you drive. You would not believe how many folks drive with their cell phones in their hand. Well you probably do. One thing that I did notice, is that a lot of the drivers that I saw with phones in their hand(s), had damage to their right front bumper and headlight area. From watching Canada's Worst Driver , they stated that a lot of drivers usually hit something on the passenger side more than the driver side. Makes sense as most drivers would not put themselves in danger when they have full control. In addition, most people drift to the right in their lane instead of the left as drifting left will put you into oncoming traffic on rural and residential roads. 2) You can think without being interrupted. When your song gets played on the radio, you know the one that I am talking about that makes you turn the radio up on blast and have a one man/woman choir, it distracts you from what you were previously thinking about or interrupts the conversation that you were having with your passengers. Traffic report comes on, you focus on what is being said to make sure there are no accidents in the direction that you are headed. With the radio off, you can figure out that programming problem, replay a conversation back and figure out why you said what you said, or if you believe in an higher power to pray. Habit 2: Eat Meat Once Per Day Maximum I know you are saying that that is impossible to do. It actually is very possible to do. The habit with this is that I could eat as much meat as I wanted, but it had to be consumed within a single meal or snack. Depending on where you live, it may be harder to do in some places than others. Where I live, there are not many vegan or vegetarian only restaurants, but there are restaurants that do offer vegan and vegetarian options. One side effect was that my bathroom habits changed. I realized that meat slows down my digestion, so when I would eat a large amount of meat, I would not \u201cgo\u201d as often. For me, it involved a lot of thinking ahead about what I was going to eat. It also involved taking a lunch everyday\u2026 yes single day\u2026 instead of going out for lunch. Some days, that meant I ate a big bowl of oatmeal for lunch as I didn\u2019t cook dinner the night before. Habit 3: Pack A Lunch During the month of August, I had many expenses come up. Vehicle registration, having tress cut, new car battery after the previous gave out unexpectedly, home repairs\u2026 it was a lot. I calculated the amount that I had spent on going out to eat during the month of July. It totaled to about $75 or the equivalent of 1.5 tanks of gas. When I started looking more intently at the non-essential things that I was spending my money on and converting that to the financial equivalent of the essentials that I was spending my money on, it put things into a greater perspective financially that I was really living at my means. So by cutting back on takeout and going out to eat, I was able to divert those funds to things that would bring me a greater sense of accomplishment, like doing handy work or my own car repairs or making financial investments with the savings. Habit 4: Work It Out One of the ways to reduce stress is to work out. So I made a commitment to myself to do Focus T25 or Wii Sports a couple of times per week. Now I did not follow the T25 workout plan as it was designed given that I did not have the time to be able to do so. My strategy was that some workout is better than no workout. Was I sore the first week of consistently doing Wii and T25? Yes. Almost to the point that I would rather sit or lay down than stand up. Did I feel a change in my body and level of energy? Yup. Conclusion Now I am not saying that what I have done will work for you. Everybody is different and has their own way of dealing with the complexities of life. That said, consider this post as a guide for what you can do for your 21+ day habit changing, fasting or prayer. These are just my thoughts.","title":"21 Days for a New Habit"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-08-15-21-days-for-a-new-habit/#background","text":"They say that it takes 21 days to learn a new habit and to break old ones.

This week's particular movie was \"Disney's Christopher Robin\". As I was in church, watching this message and movie, it spoke to me given the number of changes that were taking place in my life. SPOILER ALERT: I do mention scenes from the movie. So if you have not watched the movie yet and hate spoilers, go watch the movie before reading this article. Things That I Got From This Movie Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest. This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil. When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset There\u2019s a song, called \"Holy Ghost Power\" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them. In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result. We Are Not Who We Used To Be. Sometimes We Become Lost The smartest of people make mistakes. We are all human. When a bridge failure or airplane malfunction occurs, often the maintainers and engineers get the blame. The investigators often go back to the original drawings and design to see if there were any miscalculations, typos, or other errors that were overlooked. Once those errors are identified, they are corrected so that they do not occur again. Whether it be redrawing the bridge or redesigning a component of the plane, it has now become better and it is not what it used to be. In the movie, this was reflected by Christopher Robin going back to the Hundred Acre Wood. Once there and Christopher Robin had to show the other inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood that he was indeed Christopher Robin as they last remembered him being a young boy and not a man. I like to refer to this as \"growth and development\". Find What Makes You Happy In the movie, Christopher Robin and Pooh are at the train station trying to catch the train to take Pooh back home. Pooh sees a balloon stand and says that he wants a balloon. Christopher initially says no but then gives in after Pooh mentions that the balloon will bring him happiness. Getting big things and dreams accomplished do bring us happiness, but sometimes it is the small things that can bring us the most happiness. For me, that would mean being in the presence of others, also known as quality time, that brings the greatest amount of happiness. Conclusion Everything happens for a reason. For me, it felt like perfect timing as these takeaway points and more are steps that I need to take to go forward in life.","title":"Takeaways from Christopher Robin movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#things-that-i-got-from-this-movie","text":"","title":"Things That I Got From This Movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#doing-nothing-often-leads-to-the-very-best-of-something","text":"Picture a tree in a forest.

As you can imagine, the course is designed for Canadians, but I found that the concepts, ideas, and terminology could be applied to individuals in other countries. I was able to complete the course in about 4-5 hours (I did it all on Christmas Eve). The article that was written about the course, gives more insight into what the course is about and who it is designed for. Once you complete the course, you will receive a certificate of completion. Feel free to read the article . Below are my notes from the course. They are not well structured, but I did make an effort to note the key points that were mentioned in each section. I have also included my test results from each section in case you want to compare your results to mine. For each section, you have to get 80% or greater in order to pass each module. I would encourage you to take the course for yourself even if you are good with money. I consider myself to be good with money, but did not realize until I got to Module 8 that there is a psychological aspect to how well or bad you are with money and investing. Module 1, Intro No notes from this section. No test for this section. Module 2, Debt and Borrowing Common Sources of Debt understand what sources of credit are most appropriate terms and conditions for the type of debt Credit Cards are easier to obtain rewards and benefits look at the fees and interest rates a card may have a high rate, but the benefits can outweigh the rate Lines of Credit operates similar to checking account as it gives debit cards or is connected to checks it accrues interest immediately usually has lower fees and interest rates than credit cards people often usually take out a larger balance for line of credit than for credit cards as they have lower rates Long Term Financing usually used for larger costs assets, cars, or houses if you don't pay for it in full, then the asset is repossessed the asset is collateral Mortgages used specifically for buying a home minimum down payment is usually required, 5% to 20% down payment cant be used from other sources, like line of credit mortgage loan insurance covers the lender in case you default a change of the mortgage term will require agreement between the two parties involved loans are amortized type of interest rate is a consideration. mortgage payments stay the same with fixed rates. However variable rates will cause your payment amount to go up. time and interest are impacted by the mount of payments made during the repayment period Credit Scores Credit Worthiness Credit history is used and based on credit report.

Of course I asked about why she chose the word that she chose and her response was rather motivating that I ought to do the same to set myself on a better trajectory for the year. I have to be honest thought. I had never heard of a yearly word concept. After doing some online research, skipping over the number of articles that talked about Merriam-Websters word of 2019 (which was \"them\"), I found out that this has been a thing since 2006 . Who knew? Some articles suggested picking a word for each quarter of the year. Thinking of 4 words for 12 months was a bit more difficult as I struggled to decide on one word for the entire 12 months. Eventually I did decide on a word. Here is how I went through the process of determining a word for the year. Make a List I started by making a list of words that I thought would be the most relevant for me this year, that highlight things that I did not get quite right last year, and something that I knew I could stick to. After some debate, and online research, I came up with the following list: dominate leadership create elevate relationships Each word has a back story in how it made it to the list. Dominate I started a new job a couple of months ago. One of the major things about this job, is that it has required me to learn technology that I have not worked with in almost a decade. Given this significant shift, I want to be very great at it coming out of the gate. I remember watching \"Storm Chasers\" back in the day and during some of the episodes, Reed Timmer would say \"dominate, dominate, dominate\" over and over again while they were chasing tornadoes. I felt that by him saying the word over and over and over again, it reinforced his drive to seek out, find storms, and to be able to chase better than most that had been in the industry longer than him. Leadership If you have read any of John Maxwell's books, you know all he talks about is being a leader. Being a leader does not mean that you have to be at the top. It does mean that you can motivate and obtain followers where you currently are. Demonstrating leadership can help you get to the top. Create As you may know, I have a YouTube channel where I show viewers how to do projects that they might be considering or how to do something when it comes to technology (after all I do work in IT). However, my channel has not been as successful as I would like it to be. The reasoning behind this word, was to create better and more content than I have in years past. In doing so, I would hope that I would increase my subscriber base and following. Elevate Seeing the potential in others can make them feel better in their worse time. I do believe that we are called to be able to support each other when we have the resources to be able to do so. In turn, those that support will get support for their efforts. Relationships I had a dating relationship that failed in the previous year over differences in opinion. Also had some friendships that kicked the can as well. Having those relationships end was never the end goal, but here I am. Also, I am an introvert. Most introverts do not have large friendship circles or networks, mostly because it takes so much energy to maintain those circles. However, I do have a desire to engage and interact more with others despite my introverted ways. My Word for 2020 After much contemplation, I chose \"relationships\" as my word for 2020. I realized that relationships are the key or foundation to each one of the other words in my list. dominate - While it is possible to dominate on your own, it is easier to and better do it with a team. One of the main examples of this was Reed Timmer. He and his team of storm chasers would follow storms for several days and weeks on end. Without those relationships, you cannot have a dominate. leadership - In order to be a leader, you have to have a relationship with the people that you are going to lead. create - Those that create digital content, do it in part because of the relationships that you can build with others online. Without those relationships of interacting with people, the content that individuals create would be useless. elevate - Connect with people before you correct people. Being able to build others up is a good skill. From my experience, in order to be able to improve the lives of others, you have to have a positive relationship with those individuals. Conclusion Hopefully this article has inspired you to come up with a word for the year in effort to better achieve your goals.","title":"Word of the Year 2020"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-03-word-of-the-year/#word-of-the-year-2020","text":"","title":"Word of the Year 2020"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-03-word-of-the-year/#background","text":"A friend was telling me that she had chose a word for the year.

One of the main examples of this was Reed Timmer. He and his team of storm chasers would follow storms for several days and weeks on end. Without those relationships, you cannot have a dominate. leadership - In order to be a leader, you have to have a relationship with the people that you are going to lead. create - Those that create digital content, do it in part because of the relationships that you can build with others online. Without those relationships of interacting with people, the content that individuals create would be useless. elevate - Connect with people before you correct people.

For the past two years, I have given up something during the fasting season and kept track of it on my Trello board. This year, I have decided that I would blog about my experience and results from fasting. My goal is to update this post each day with the updates for that particular day. Why 21 days? It has been said that if you commit to doing or not doing something for 21 days in a row, that it will become a habit and you will be more inclined to continue doing or not doing it beyond the 21 days. I did a fast last year for 21 days and some of those habits have stuck. Updates I will be posting my daily updates here so that you can follow along in my progress. Perhaps you have your own fast that you want to consider doing for the start of the year. Day 0 - January 4 I know what you are thinking... why is he starting to count with 0 instead of 1? Computers start their counting of items with 0. However, humans usually start with 1, so programmers like myself have to add additional code in so that the counting will be acceptable to humans. Consider this day to be the day of preparation before entering the fast. My goals during this fast are to do the following: No Facebook Social media is addictive. Main reason that I am avoiding Facebook is because I login to that website more than the other social media accounts that I have. I did see a post that said to not use social media less but to use it more intently. That post is the header graphic of this post. I do plan on doing this more after the fast is over. For the fast though, I have found that when I cut out the most addictive social media habits, that I am able to do more of the things that I previously have put off to the side. Daily Commits to Github As part of my personal branding strategy, I want to actually demonstrate that I do participate in the IT community and provide digital contributions. That said, I plan on contributing to making at least one commit to any of my repositories per day during the fast. I know it seems excessive, but hear (or read) me out on this. Not all of my commits will be code related. The version control for my blog is on Github, so some of those commits will be new or updated content for my website. Other commits will be new or updated code that I have done. No Meat, Little to No Cheese I have refrained from eating meat in the past. There were some noticable differences such as having a flatter stomach, going to The John more frequently, and being more energetic. In addition, I have watched documentaries that state that eating too much meat can have a negative impact on your body. When it comes to cheese, I have noticed that eating a lot of it can change my regularity. Since the last fast, I have gotten away from eating it sparingly. Thus I want to get back in that habit of not eating it as frequently. Journal Daily I have discovered in recent months that there is something about writing your thoughts and ideas out. Yes, there is the scripture in Habakkuk about writing the vision and making it plan. I also think that journaling allows us to clear our heads from the things that we want to remember, but do not necessarily need to always keep readily on our minds. In other words, it allows you to \"clean out the attic\". I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM periodically, then you will run into problems. On Linux systems, if you fill up the temporary storage, the OS might crash. Two Day Rule for Exercising Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activity. Water, Tea, or Natural Juices As I have gotten older, I rarely drink sodas. During this fasting season, I am going to make an effort to not drink anything that may contain High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) as a lot of products contain this substance. They say that HFCS is fine to consume in moderation. Only problem that I have is... 1) What is \"moderation\"? Is it once per week, once per quarter, once per year? 2) It is hard to have something in moderation, when it is contained in majority of the food and drink that we consume. Daily Prayer As if this was obvious enough... heck it is in the title of the post. Day 1 - January 5 Today I had no meat. Went to Chipotle for lunch and an Indian restaurant for dinner. I only had water and tea to drink today. I spent the morning of today serving at church, so had to get up slightly earlier than normal. However, I was able to take a nap after the church services. I interacted with others about this and my previous post regarding my word of the year . It was very enlightening to hear about others' doing the same thing as myself, but for their personal benefit and mental health. I did not get around to exercising. Definitely is a must for tomorrow though. I did refrain from Facebook. I made a post yesterday on IG and Twitter, so I responded to messages and comments regarding those. I did find myself mindlessly scrolling, which I am trying to get out of the habit of. Once I realized that I was doing it, I redirected my focus to being more productive. Day 2 - January 6 Only had one real meal today and that was lunch. Had the remaining Chipotle from yesterday with some chips, Nutty Buddy bar, and a muffin. As I write this at 8 PM, I don't feel hungry, although I could eat. Was up earlier than normal today. I took that time to write in the journal and to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the new ones that I have set for this year. I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already had to modify them as they call for meat. Photos will be posted in the days to come an whether I would make them again or if I need to donate that cookbook to the local library. Day 3 - January 7 Was able to get a walk around the block in today. Could have walked an additional block as I did not do a walk yesterday. Made lemonade from scratch for the first time. It definitely has the lemon kick in it. Will need to use less lemons next time. Watched a sermon that was sent to me titled \"Looking Back, Keep Sitting, or Moving Forward\". It was a good message as it talked about how that we all have a past. However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6. I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing a system that works for you. I feel that these practices that I am learning can be applied to the work that I do. Day 4 - January 8 I actually managed to sleep a full night last night. Not sure why that was the case. It could possibly be because of the lack of meat in my diet, thus changing my body chemistry. Who knows? Surprisingly, I have been able to keep up with daily commits to this post and to Github as I have set out to do. I updated one of the sites that I had not updated in over a year. It had a number of security patches that needed to go in. In addition, the automated deployment script that I had created, was not working because of the execute permissions not being set (doggone Linux). Walking during lunch breaks is a good thing as it allows me to get in the recommended 10K steps per day. However, I do need some shoes that are intended for walking such distances during lunch break, as the dress shoes that I normally wear are clearly not cut out for that job. Day 5 - January 9 I listened to a sermon that talked about letting the past be the past, and to focus on what is to come in the future. I have been listening to more sermons recently, and this seems to be a common theme among them. These sermons were all delivered around the end of 2019. Watched some videos today, that had me thinking about some side income ideas that I could use to advance and extend my skillset in the IT field. I have watched several videos about people that are using Fiverr to make income. I used Fiverr back in 2011, but had not really be active on the platform recently. I figured that I could use platforms like these, to build automations to make the turnaround time for some of the requests faster thus reducing the manual amount of work required on my part. Day 11 - January 16 I have been sick the last few days. Managed to catch the flu. I am still in the recovery phase as I write this. This is part of the reason why there is a gap of about a week between updates. During this time, I have managed to go outside during the daytime, weather permitting, and capture some sunlight. Being in the house all day quarantining yourself because of doctor's orders is no fun, but it is a necessary precaution. Not sure who found out that sunlight helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like boost of energy. Not quite like the boost that Popeye gets after eating a can of Spinach, but more like never riding a bike before and once you get on the bike realizing the purpose of the training wheels. I have been told many of times how my post about squirrels taught me about women and food is insanely funny. I did not realize that it would catch on in the way that it did, but I am glad that I can share my story with others and they get something out of it. I have gotten through almost entire week of ASP.Net Core MVC training. What that means is that I can build enterprise grade applications that will run a multiple platforms. This is definitely a useful skill that I am glad that I am able to add to my toolbelt. To my surprise, I have only missed 2 out of 11 days thus far, making a commit to any of my repositories on Github. Having a blog that is versioned on Github has helped with this cause. Also having requests for me to share knowledge about Python and Linux have added to the commits. Those of you that have requested such info, thanks! Day 12 - January 17 Completed training for ASP.Net Core MVC. The training is related to projects that I will be working on in the future. It was good to get training and some exposure to the subject prior to actually having to work with it. I did practice some courses and performing tutorials that I was able to find on YouTube and PluralSight courses. Day 19 - January 23 The fast is almost over. Did have a moment today where the lunch option provided had meat, but I did remove it from the sandwich was provided. Coworker informed me of a challenge that he has chosen to take up for this year. He said that hi grandson was doing 20 pushups in the morning and 20 in the evening for the year of 2020. Figured that I would give this a shot as well just to see what gains or other benefits that I can get from it. Will post about it sometime in the future. Day 21 - January 25 Finally have reached the end of the fast. What's next you ask? Well some habits I will try to keep in place. Others I will slowly reintroduce, but do my best to maintain what I have accomplished during the fast.","title":"21 Days of Prayer and Fasting"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting/#background","text":"Each year, the church that I attend does a fast and prayer at the beginning of the year.

This trip is the second time that I have done the zip line at this location. Mega Zip Line Make Your Reservation I was able to make my reservation via the Red Mountain Park website. It was easy and straightforward. Just have to pick one of the time slots that is available on the day that you choose, pay your money, and sign the waiver. At the time of this writing, the cost to do the zip line is $29 (USD) per person, not including credit card processing fees. There are some physical and age requirements that you have to meet in order to be able to do the zip line. Be sure that you read about those before making your reservation. Day of the Hike In order to get to the zip line adventure, you have to hike in from the parking lot, to the main office (which is a metal shipping container), to a secondary check-in point (which is another shipping container), and then to the Kaul Tower. I estimate that the total walk time was about 15-20 minutes. Once at the tower, you will be given a full body harness and helmet to wear. Climb the Tower To get to the zip line platform, you have to climb the tower from the inside. The tower is approximately 80 feet high. it has a very tight winding combination of steps and ladders. The steps are very steep and the ladders have nets that will catch you if you fall. The ladders resemble wood pallets. Prepare for Launch Once at the top, you'll have to wait until you are called up to the platform. Only two riders are allowed on the platform at a time as it is a small space. You will be connected zip line cable and given instructions on how to get off the platform. For me, the instructions given, varied from my actual experience. I am 6 feet tall. Before you launch, you are advised to squat down into your harness and make your way to the edge of the platform. If you are shorter, the harness will start pulling on you in the squatting position and the weight of your body will be on the zip line cable. Because I am taller, the harness did not start pulling on me until I went off of the platform. That being said, the initial second or two after coming off of the platform, felt like a free fall jump. Scary! Zip Away Next comes the fun part. Zip lining for 1000 feet. The wind will definitely get in your face. I did this during the winter season, so there were not mosquitoes out and about. However, in the summer months, you will want to consider wearing sunglasses as the last thing that you want to happen is a bug slamming into your eye at 30 miles per hour. As you get closer to the end of the zip-line, you will pass the dismount platform and gravity will slow you down and send you back towards the dismount platform. You will zip forward again to the dismount platform where the staff will help you get off the line and back onto the ground. Again I Say! Again! If you choose, you can go a second time. The second time, they will let you go backwards on the zip line if you choose. The first time, they do not let you go backwards as they want to adapt to the experience of zip-lining. I chose to go backwards the second time. There is definitely a difference going backwards as you cannot see what is coming up, but you do see the tower that you launch from fade off in the distance. Hiking Trails There are approximately 15 miles of hiking trails in the park. Some of the trails have overview or lookout points were you can get a greater view of the park and of the city of Birmingham. A lot of people had their dogs walking with them on the trails. There were also bike riders present. If you do choose to ride a bike at the park, be sure to ride a mountain bike and not a road bike as none of the trails are paved. The more popular trails do have a gravel surface, but the other trails are only dirt. There are trail maps at various locations in the park. The trails are marked with 4x4 inch markers mounted to the trees next to the trail. Each trail has a number and a color scheme so that you know what trail that you are on. When you come to some of the trail intersections, there is a trail marker, similar to the old concrete street signs, that denote which trail continues in which direction. These markers are noted as being done by a local Boy Scout troop in 2016. Old Iron Mines This park is situated in Southwest Birmingham. Back in the late 1800 and early 1900s, iron ore was dug out from the mountain and used to make steel. As you may know, during the Industrial Age, Birmingham, Alabama was known as the \"Pittsburgh of the South\" as it was producing comparable amounts of steel and iron as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Those mines are now abandoned and sealed, but are still in place. As part of this adventure to the park, I took a hike over to the Ishkooda #14 Mine. As you may can tell from the above and below picture, there are some rocks and dirt that has a pink-ish color to it. That coloring is the iron ore mixed in with the dirt. There was not much to see at this particular mine, but you could see a little bit into the mine via the Manway whole as it was not tightly sealed. Conclusion Overall I had a good experience and would go back to the park again, to hike on some of the other trails and to do some of the other adventures that they have available. If you are interested in visiting the Red Mountain Park, you can check out their website . I did not receive any sponsorship or compensation for this post.

Only two riders are allowed on the platform at a time as it is a small space. You will be connected zip line cable and given instructions on how to get off the platform. For me, the instructions given, varied from my actual experience. I am 6 feet tall. Before you launch, you are advised to squat down into your harness and make your way to the edge of the platform. If you are shorter, the harness will start pulling on you in the squatting position and the weight of your body will be on the zip line cable. Because I am taller, the harness did not start pulling on me until I went off of the platform. That being said, the initial second or two after coming off of the platform, felt like a free fall jump.

However, in the summer months, you will want to consider wearing sunglasses as the last thing that you want to happen is a bug slamming into your eye at 30 miles per hour. As you get closer to the end of the zip-line, you will pass the dismount platform and gravity will slow you down and send you back towards the dismount platform.

Please use the navigation to jump to the question that you are looking for or use the search feature. Basics How do you keep the lights from shorting or tripping breakers during wet weather? Each connection that is on the ground is wrapped in electrical tape. That prevents water from reaching the connections, which would result in an electrical short, thus tripping the breaker and shutting down the show. Outlets and plugs that are not on the ground, are pointed downwards so that water cannot enter the socket and/or taped to prevent water from getting in. What have you done in previous years? Use the navigation on the left to see the information about the displays from previous years. Are there other residential light shows? Yes, there are many that exist. See the list below. Those with \"MGM\" in parenthesis are located in or near the Montgomery, Alabama area. Visit their respective pages for details about their show. Christmas on the Coosa (MGM) Lighting Up Paxton Lights To A Beat Listen To Our Lights Map of Light Displays Moss Lights Percivals Christmas Lights and Santaland & Clark Wannabe (MGM) Riparian Lights San Jose Lights Tara Lights (MGM) The Christmas Light Show The Minion House (MGM) Thyno Zgouvas' Christmas Wonderland (MGM) Way Off Broadway Lights (MGM) Wetumpka Griswold Christmas (MGM) Woodard Family Lights Money How much does it cost to run the light show? Your electric bill must be high! Short Answer Since LEDs are used for the light show, it is not high at all. To run the show for 5 weeks, with all the lights on (2,130 LEDs) would cost a maximum of $38.90. Given that all the lights are not all the entire time and the equipment is not running at max capacity (which hardly ever happens), the actual cost is less than this. See Do The Math for the breakout and how this cost was derived. Long Answer - Do The Math With all lights turned on (2130 LEDs were used for the 2020 Light Show), it pulls 130 Watts. The show controller and components can pull a maximum of 305 Watts. Thus the show in total can use 435 (130 + 305) Watts maximum. The lights run for 33.5 hours per week (Sunday through Thursday, 4.5 hours; Friday and Saturday, 5.5 hours). The show runs for 5 weeks during the Christmas season. The controller runs 168 hours per week (24 hours per day). Electric companies measure the amount of electricity that you use in kilowatt-hours. To convert W (Watts) to kWh (kilowatt-hours), you have to compute the lights and controller separately since they are on for different durations. E(kWh lights) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 130 Watts * 33.5 hours / 1000 = 4.355 kWh E(kWh controller) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 435 Watts * 168 hours / 1000 = 73.08 kWh The rate for electricity (in 2020) during the winter months (Oct-May) is $0.100511 per kWh. Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44 Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34 That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is Christmas season would be $7.78 or $38.90 for the entire season. Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount. You built a control box for your show. How much did that cost? A total of $332.59. I did have some items already on hand from existing projects that I was able to use for this project. For those items, I used the current cost for those items. This doesn't include the wood, nails, or paint that I used to build the control box or the AC lights that I already had on hand. What are the parts that I need to build my own control box? This is the list of the electrical related components. The full list of components will vary depending upon how to you choose to design your control box. Fuse holders (x24) = $7.50 Fuses (rated 2 Amps) (x30)= $17.97 8-channel solid state relays (x2) = $9.33 SPT-2 male plugs (x25) = $23.99 SPT-2 female plugs (x25) = $23.99 FM transmitter = $12.49 Raspberry Pi 3 = $40.00 Assorted breadboard wires (x40) = $7.49 3.5mm audio cable = $5.99 Outlets (used) (x12) = $6.00 Outlet boxes and outlet faceplates (x6) = $12.00 14 gauge wire (25 ft) = $12.73 16 gauge wire (25 ft) = $8.98 SPT-2 18 gauge 150 ft spools (x2) = $94.13 Additional AC lights (10 strands, 100 lights each) = $50.00 Total = $332.59 All prices are listed in USD. Does not include taxes or shipping fees. Technology What kind of hardware do you use? Raspbery Pi The Falcon Pi Player is installed in the Raspberry Pi. The Rasberry Pi controls the relays, which in turn controls all of the lights. The Pi controls each of the 24 channels of relays via the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Christmas Lights All of the lights are LED. Only two colors are used for the light show, white and red. Solid State Relays All of the relays are Solid State Relays (SSR). SSRs were used because they have no mechanical or moving parts and having greater reliability for being switched on and off frequently. Mechanical relays heat up from switching on an off. When done repeatedly, like during a song, the relay can actually over heat, self-destruct, or weld itself closed. FM Radio Transmitter Music is transmitted over radio via a low-power FM transmitter. Music goes into the transmitter directly from the Raspberry Pi and broadcasted on an open frequency. Radio Locator mentioned below was used to locate the best frequency. What kind of software do you use? Xlights The music and light sequences are timed together using Xlights. This software is open source and runs on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can download the latest release from the repository . For assistance with configuring or issues with xLights, you can post in the Official xLights Support Group . Falcon Pi Player (FPP) Once the sequences have been created in Xlights, those files are copied over to FPP. From there, the show data files, music files, and scheduling are all connected within this software. You can download the latest release from the repository . For assistance with configuring or issues with Falcon Pi Player, you can post in the FPP, Falcon Player . Kdenlive Kdenlive is a video editing tool. It can also be used to modify audio files. The show intro audio file was modified with Kdenlive to have the voice over and background music on the same track. You can download the latest version from its website . Song updates are posted to Twitter. How does that work? See the Falcon Pi Monitor page for more information about that project. Resources Where can I find out more information or ask questions?

Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44 Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34 That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is Christmas season would be $7.78 or $38.90 for the entire season. Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount.","title":"Long Answer - Do The Math"},{"location":"lightshow/faq/#you-built-a-control-box-for-your-show-how-much-did-that-cost","text":"A total of $332.59.

Table of Contents Basics Declaring Variables Functions Running Python Scripts Math and Numbers Addition Division Multiplication Random Number Subtraction Examples Hello World Raspberry Pi Traffic Light Controller Running Python Scripts python <script name> Replace <script name> with the file name of the Python script that you want to run. Declare Variables Variables hold the values that are used in your application or script. In Python, variables are not strong-typed. This means that the variables you declare, are not limited to a particular data type. However, the variable does have a value, any future changes to that value must be of the same type. So you cannot set the value of a variable to a string and then change it to a integer. myVariable = \"red\" myOtherVariable = false myOtherOtherVariable = 5 Functions To write a function in Python, you start the function out with the \"def\" keyword. Example def myFunction (param1, param2, param3): sum = param1 + param2 + param3 return sum If you notice, there are no braces or brackets around the contents of the function. Python relies on indentation for the grouping of lines together within a given section. Random Number Random nubmers can be used to do countdowns or other things that are needed. To get a random number, you have to import the randomint class from the random library by adding from random import randint to the top of your Python script. Then you can set the random integer to a variable by doing myNumber = randint(5,60) In the example above, 5 is the lower limit of the range and 60 is the upper limit of the range. If your range needs to be different, then changes either or both of these values. Basic Mathematics Addition To do addition in Python, just have to code out two numbers and add them together like you would normally do for a math problem that you were writing on paper. Just keep in mind that the calculations always have to be done on the right side of the equals sign and will be set to the variable on the left of the equals sign. sum = 5 + 3 print sum Output: 8 Subtraction Similar in fashion, subtraction is written just like addition, except it uses the minus sign instead of the plus sign. difference = 10 - 3 print difference Output: 7 Multiplication Multiplication is done using the asterisk. product = 4 * 3 print product Output: 12 Division quotient = 20 / 5 print quotient Output: 4 Hello World Below is a sample of how to print out \"Hello world\" in Python. print (\"Hello world\") Output: Hello world More Resources The Raspberry Pi traffic light project is written in Python code.

A few modules exist which more or less successfully attempt to get Drupal to display meaningful breadcrumbs on every page. One of these modules is menu_breadcrumb , which displays the breadcrumb trail based on current node's menu path. Very useful and sufficient in most use cases. Limitations and automatic menu modules The only problem with menu_breadcrumb is when you're not happy to grant users the administer menu permission to create and assign menu items for the content they create. Several Drupal modules exist which work around the permission restriction and automatically create menu items for newly created content nodes. To name a few, Auto Menu and Automatic Menu , both of which are either only available for Drupal 5.x, or their Drupal 6.x implementation is still in beta development stage. Rules and Drupal API Fortunately, a quick and easy way to create menu items programmatically doesn't even require a standalone module. All we're going to need is the Rules module and a bit of Drupal API knowledge. The Rules set of modules allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions, such as arbitrary PHP code execution, based on occurring events, such as node creation. For the Drupal API part, we'll use a single function menu_link_save . menu_link_save requires an item configuration parameter, whose key names mirror the column names of Drupal's menu_links database table. The solution As mentioned above, we're going to use the Rules module. It's installation is pretty straightforward and requires no additional configuration. Let's move right to the setting up our rule. Say we want to create a menu item under Primary Links menu's Blog item every time a new node of type Story is created. Navigate your browser to Administer \u00bb Rules \u00bb Triggered rules page, add a new rule and configure it along the lines of the image: Finally, we're getting to the PHP snippet itself, which we'll use to automatically create a new menu item every time this rule is triggered. Click Execute custom PHP code and insert the following fragment of code: $item = array( 'link_path' => 'node/' . $node->nid, 'link_title' => $node->title, 'plid' => 426, 'hidden' => 1 ); menu_link_save($item); Just a few remarks on otherwise pretty simple piece of code. menu_link_save function will only accept normalized path as a link path. When using anything nontrivial for the path, such as the loaded node's path property, always use drupal_get_normal_path() to normalize its value! menu_name is the the machine-readable name of the menu. You can get that from Administer \u00bb Site building \u00bb Menus page as the last component of the menu customization URL. Value of plid is the menu link id of the item you want your item to be a child of.

Some developers prefer not to use the click to build version, because it limits which modules and themes that you may use. Also, you cannot update the website when a new Drupal version is released, but instead have to wait until 1 and 1 updates the Drupal core to the most recent version. If you are like most professional developers, you create websites in a development environment and then move them over to a production or live environment. However, most developers do not have their development environment configured the same way as 1 and 1's web hosted environment.

Some developers prefer not to use the click to build version, because it limits which modules and themes that you may use. Also, you cannot update the website when a new Drupal version is released, but instead have to wait until 1 and 1 updates the Drupal core to the most recent version. If you are like most professional developers, you create websites in a development environment and then move them over to a production or live environment. However, most developers do not have their development environment configured the same way as 1 and 1's web hosted environment. This guide is to show you how to install your Drupal 7 website on 1 and 1.","title":"Installing Drupal 7 on 1 and 1 Web Hosting"},{"location":"technology/2015.06.28-installing-drupal-7-on-1-and-1-web-hosting/#requirements","text":"1 and 1 web hosting package that has PHP and MySQL database support.

Export the database of your Drupal installation from your development environment to a SQL file. If the file is really large (2MB or more), clear Drupal's cache before exporting. This will reduce the file size and the number of queries that will have to be ran. Check the status of the database account that you have created. If the status is \"Ready\", click the PHPMyAdmin link to view the database. On the left, click the name of the database that you set up to use for Drupal. Click the \"SQL\" tab.

When a power failure occurs, the Wemo switch will default to the Off state. I'm using the Wemo switch to be able to remotely restart the router if I have internet connection issues.

Currently I build automations using Selenium WebDriver and Sikuli to automate routine daily tasks. Since I maintain multiple websites, I figured that I could use this same technology to perform the code updates on the websites that I manage. Selenium WebDriver has some first time setup steps that have to be done in order for you to be able to build the automations. My browser of choice is Firefox. Some people reading this will not be thrilled about that, but everyone has their preferences. If you like to use Chrome, or worse Internet Explorer, then the steps mentioned below are similar to those for Firefox. However this post focuses on setting up with Firefox. First thing that you will need to do is to have Eclipse or similar IDE installed on your computer. That will not be covered in this post. Next, download the Gecko Driver. That can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver . The Gecko Driver serves as a middle man between WebDriver and the web browser. The web browser cannot directly communicate or interact with the web browser. What happens is WebDriver interacts with the Gecko Driver. Then the Gecko Driver translates those interactions into actions that the browser can perform. Once the action is performed, then response is sent back from the browser to the Gecko Driver to WebDriver. Next, create a Maven project. In the pom.xml file, you will need to add the following dependency to the file: <dependency> <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId> <version>3.14.0</version> </dependency> At the time of this writing, 3.14.0 version, was the second latest versoin that was available. I would recommend using the latest or later version that is available. Next, add the Java code below to your main function. This is the simpliest code to get an automation running with Firefox. System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); // define geckodriver location WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); // open the website of choice Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser ``` In the above, /home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver will need to be replaced with the location that you have downloaded the Gecko Driver. If you choose, you may also change the website that the browser opens. Now you may run the application that you have built. If done correctly, you will see the browser open, then the Google home page appear, then the browser close. There may be some red text in the Java console, but there is no need to be alarmed by this unless there is an exception mentioned. The code used here can be downloaded from my Github repository at https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial The entire file Java file would look like the following: package com.thealmostengineer.seleniumtutorial; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver; /** * Simple webdriver * */ public class App { static void geckoDriverTest() throws Exception { System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.manage().window().maximize(); // maximize the browser window driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser } public static void main( String[] args ) { try { geckoDriverTest(); } catch (Exception e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } }","title":"Set up Gecko Driver on Ubuntu"},{"location":"technology/2019.04.05-set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu/#set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu","text":"Selenium WebDriver can be used to automate routine tasks and to perform regression tests.

That being said, I decided to write my own module that would handle this functionality for me. By writing my own module, I can customize the module how I choose without having additional features that I do not need.

Sometimes having an app does help you out to be more productive. Other times, it is a waste of space and a way for the company to spy on you and your activities so that they can target you with ads. That being said, here are seven reasons why I am hesitant to install new apps. Reason One: Mobile Friendly Website It is no secret that majority of the online traffic today comes from some sort of mobile device. As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websites identified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders. Which brings me to my next reason... Reason Two: Less Notifications Today's society is constantly connected. Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level. Reason Three: Phone Space Apps take up space. Some take up more than others. At last check, the Facebook app is over 150MB. Compare that to other apps, and that is a large application. To add to that, apps store data on your phone. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will cache some of the data on your phone that they have downloaded in the background. Over time, this cached data, if not removed, will slow down your phone and reduce your battery life. Meanwhile, I could be using that phone space to store videos, photos, music, audio books... you get the idea. Reason Four: It May Be Old, But It Still Works When you do not rely on the app to be able to interact with a website or service, you can use an older phone. Periodically, Android raises the minimum version that apps have to comply with. Some app developers, mandate that you have an operating system that is no more than 3 versions behind the latest stable version available. About a year ago, I encountered this with the Southwest app. I have Android Lollipop on my phone. In an update, Southwest made the minimum version to Android Marshmallow, thus not allowing me to have the app on my phone. Southwest mobile website does everything that the app does, including displaying my boarding pass, so I started using that and uninstalled the app. Yes\u2026 I know that I could have went and got a new phone so that I could have continued to use the app. No\u2026 I could not justify the cost of getting a new phone for convenience of being able to check-in on a flight about 2 to 3 times per year. Besides if I had issues with the mobile website, Southwest lets you print boarding passes for free. Reason Five: IOS Versus Android Appearance and Features If you are an Android person asking an iPhone user how to do something in an app, there is a 50/50 chance that the directions given will not work. Same goes for the other way around. Why is that? Well iPhone apps have to follow Apple standards in order to be listed in the App Store. Android apps do not have similar standards. In addition, some apps are built upon the features that are native to that operating system. Therefore, if one system interprets \"and\" as \"&\" and the other interprets it as \"+\", then you will get two different outcomes for the same thing. This problem is not as big now as it was in the past thanks to programming languages such as Xamarin, which allow for code to be written once and be compatible for iOS and Android platforms. Reason Six: Information Apps Are A Waste In the past, I've done consultations for small businesses and startups and they claim that one of main things that they want to do as part of getting their business off the ground is to create an app. Some do have their preferences about getting aniOS app built before the Android app and vice versa, but that is not the point of this reason. When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this: KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do? CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services. KENNY: Anything else beyond that? CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app. KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app created is x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars. CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find. Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download an app because they want information about your business. That is what your website is for. People download apps because they want additional features that are not available via your website or to enhance the functionality of their phone. For instance, some people, myself included, have multiple email accounts. I would not download an email app that only supported one email account. While it is true that I could have all of my email forwarded to a single account, I have multiple accounts because each account has a designated purpose. I do not want my \"daily coupon and specials\" emails be merged in with my \"new billing statement available\" emails. Reason Seven: The App Is A Fancy Web Browser Try this... go to your app and take a note of its appearance. Then go to the website (or mobile website) that is associated with that app. If the app and the mobile website look the same, there is a 99.999999994% (yes that last 4 is significant) chance that the app that you have is just a web browser that only allows you to access that company's website. That's right... there are companies that are building mobile friendly websites and then building apps that only navigate to that mobile friendly website. I am not going to mention their names, but some financial institutions that I have done business with have done this in the past. In addition, I did some contract work for a service provider. That service provider was charging about $1,000 for the mobile app. All they were doing were changing the default URL in the app, installing a WordPress plugin so that the page would render as being mobile friendly, and publishing it to the App or Play Store. All of that took about a 1 hour to complete. Conclusion While these strategies may not work for you, I find my phone to be less of a maintenance annoyance and pain point for keeping updated since I am using fewer apps. It is true that \"There's an app for that\". With that in mind, I challenge you to think of whether you really need that app before installing it.","title":"7 Reasons I Can Do That Without The App"},{"location":"technology/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app","text":"These days, everybody wants you to download their app. However, before installing an app, I ask myself whether I really do need the app. Every company's answer to this is \"Yes with sprinkles on the side\".

Cloudflare mentioned did admit that the outage was their fault and did rectify the situation. However, it was not resolved until a number of users complained and reported images not loading. Cloudflare provides CDN services. CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Content Delivery Networks are often used by high traffic websites to be able to provide you with images, video, and other online resources faster as they are located closer to where you are. For instance, let\u2019s say a company has their primary data center in Utah, it may take about 5 seconds for an online image request to be sent and response to be returned to a device that is on the East Coast. However with a CDN, the image that is on the Utah server, is copied to a server in Virginia. Then when the request for that same image is made from the device on the East Coast, the image is provided from the Virginia server instead of the Utah server in about 1 or 2 seconds. This is part of the reason why it is said that if you upload and image or other content online, that you will never be able to delete it. Testing Environment When I primarily did IT support, we were often asked to do changes that were to be deployed in the testing environment first. Not only this, but we had to provide proof that the change being implemented in the testing environment was successful and did not destroy the testing environment before performing the change in the production environment. There is one major difference between the testing environment and the production environment. That is that the testing environment may get about 5% of the activity that the production environment gets unless a simulation is performed. Long story short, this change may have been tested in the testing environment and the CPU spike did not occur or was not noticeable to be classified as a failure. This change was probably not well tested or tested at all in a lower environment. A lower environment is supposed to be an exact copy of the production environment. In the lower environment, you can play around or try things out without breaking the production environment. Use An Automation or Script When using an automation or script to perform work, the change is less likely to be error prone. The reason being, is that most automations are tested a number of times before being rolled out. Once rolled out, they are guaranteed to work unless an unexpected situation occurs. For instance, a software dependency is not installed, thus the automation is not able to configure the software. In this circumstance, the automation should fail and roll back what activities that it has done thus far. Work in Batches It was mentioned that they noticed that the CPU usage had spiked on the primary and secondary servers. Assuming that the changes were applied at the same time, indicates a bigger problem. From my support experience, we would not deploy or make changes to all the servers at the same. What we would do is deploy to some of the servers and then deploy to the remaining servers after confirming all is well. For instance, some of the applications that I have supported had 4 application servers. We would deploy to 2 of the servers first. If the deployment went well and post-regression testing passes, then we would deploy to the remaining 2 servers. By doing things this way, it does take longer to complete the deployment. However, it ensures that you do not introduce a major failure or issue into your production environment and impact your customers. If they had deployed to the primary instances and saw that CPU spike that was mentioned, then they could have rolled back after identifying that the Conclusion When it comes to code deployment and IT infrastructure changes, this can be a lesson that we can all learn from this. Test your code in the lower environment Simulate conditions that would be encountered in the production environment as much as possible when testing. This will give you an accurate representation of what would happen under normal use. Do not deploy the change to all of the servers in a single environment at the same time After deploying the change, be sure to confirm that everything is working as it should be. Any unexpected behaviors that result after the change should be an immediate cause for alarm and the change backed out.","title":"When Deploying Before Testing"},{"location":"technology/2019.07.04-when-deploying-before-testing/#when-deploying-before-testing","text":"As you may know, on July 3, 2019, Facebook, Instagram, Down Detector, and a number of other websites were partially or fully unavailable.

The reason being, is that most automations are tested a number of times before being rolled out. Once rolled out, they are guaranteed to work unless an unexpected situation occurs. For instance, a software dependency is not installed, thus the automation is not able to configure the software. In this circumstance, the automation should fail and roll back what activities that it has done thus far.","title":"Use An Automation or Script"},{"location":"technology/2019.07.04-when-deploying-before-testing/#work-in-batches","text":"It was mentioned that they noticed that the CPU usage had spiked on the primary and secondary servers. Assuming that the changes were applied at the same time, indicates a bigger problem. From my support experience, we would not deploy or make changes to all the servers at the same. What we would do is deploy to some of the servers and then deploy to the remaining servers after confirming all is well. For instance, some of the applications that I have supported had 4 application servers. We would deploy to 2 of the servers first. If the deployment went well and post-regression testing passes, then we would deploy to the remaining 2 servers. By doing things this way, it does take longer to complete the deployment. However, it ensures that you do not introduce a major failure or issue into your production environment and impact your customers.

One of the things that I have done is to start writing more blog posts and documents in Markdown instead of using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. Reason 1: Converts to Other Platforms Markdown is used by several other platforms. One of the most noted platforms that uses Markdown is Github Pages. When using WYSIWYG, it allows you to make well formatted documents using a plain text editor, but allows you to convert them to another editor so that it looks like you typed them in a word processor (like MS Word). Why is this useful? Reason 2: Allows You To Type Faster For me, markdown allows me to type faster. I'm able to type two asterisks (**) faster than I am able to shift my hands to be able to process Ctrl+B for bolding text. In addition, you do not have to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse to click the corresponding icon for the text modification that you are trying to perform. Reason 3: No Need For WYSIWYG Many bloggers use WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors when writing their content on their website. The problem those editors, is that they add a bunch of extra HTML formatting such as paragraph, span, and div tags. Some add special characters in their paragraphs as a way to make those formatting changes. Then if you change the appearance of the website, the content of the page also changes. In the worst case, it changes uncontrollably because of the new styling (CSS) that you have in place. By using markdown, the extra formatting is not added in the field of the post. Conclusion I have decided that using Markdown is the way to go. Now sometimes, I will still have to use the older way of doing things, like when editing a document in Microsoft Word.

The thing about writing code is that at some point, maintenance has to be done on the code to keep it up to date and to add future enhancements and functionality. What Kind of Pest (The Problem) Squirrels and rats both chew on wood. However they do not eat the same stuff, so you have to be selective with the bait that you choose. For most of the automations that I build, I use Selenium WebDriver as the automations are for web-based applications. Recently, we have noticed that number of automations have not been running due to \u201cconnection refused\u201d exceptions. The connection is being refused from the automation jar not connecting to the Gecko Driver (the interface between WebDriver automation and the browser). Applying knowledge that I have of computers, normally you only see \u201cconnection refused\u201d messages when one or more of the scenarios occur too many devices trying to connect at the same time, also referred to as Denial of Service Attack or Distributed Denial of Service Attack a firewall is rejecting the connection wrong password when trying to authenticate. Tracking Down The Pest (The Analysis) I was able to immediately rule out scenarios 2 and 3 because the automation would work majority of the time. In other words, we know it is not a rat based on the evidence. Therefore, through the process of elimination, it must be a squirrel. Majority being that out of 7 days of the week that it was used, it would fail only on 1 of those days. I then did some research on the internet that provided a number of causes and solutions for the exception occurring. Some of the causes included the Gecko Driver process not being able to write to a log file because existing log file already exists (not in our case) having concurrent WebDriver automations running at the same time (which wasn\u2019t our case as we have done several at the same time in the past) to the hosts file not having the localhost IP address entered (which we did not, but nslookup and ping commands both returned valid IP addresses) having bad code. I got to that last reason in the list, bad code, and I put more effort into looking into the code as we have experienced (2+ years) and inexperienced developers on our team. Found The Nest (Found The Source Of The Problem) After search through multiple automation projects, shaking my head at some of the exact examples of bad code mentioned in Robert Martin\u2019s Clean Code , I hit the bullseye. Several of the automations had the same code. Yes\u2026 copied and pasted. First person got it working, so the next person got theirs working by doing exactly what the first person did. There's that saying about if you see one bug, there's probably another one not too far way. This would be it. To make it worse, it was multiplying everytime the code was copy and pasted. This is what I found: WebDriver driver = null; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here driver.quit(); System.exit(0); } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); System.exit(1); } Now this is just a snippet of the actual code. Obviously, I cannot put the entire code here because of confidentiality. Do you notice the problem with this code? The problem here is that if an exception occurs between the try and driver.quit(); , the browser and as a result, the Gecko Driver process never exits. What happens when you have too many processes running? The system will hang. What happens when there are too many connections open to a process? Some of those connections are refused. Spraying The Bug Spray (The Solution) To now rid the varmint of our code, I had to fix the defect that I identified. The driver.quit(); should always be executed regardless of whether the exception occurs. The reason being is that you do not want to the browser nor the Gecko Driver process running as they will hang up your system or result in the \"connection refused\" exceptions. So I changed the above code to the code below: WebDriver driver = null; int exitCode = 1; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here exitCode = 0; } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); } driver.quit(); System.exit(exitCode); The changes that I made: the driver.quit(); has been moved outside of the try-catch block. That way it will always execute whether an exception occurs or not. Could a finally block been used? Yes. However, for the sake of simplifying the code I did not use one. I moved the System.exit call to the end of the code. It is best to have only one way to exit a function. If you have multiple ways to exit (or return) out of a function, code that needs to exit may not get executed because of the multiple ways out. I created a new integer variable called exitCode . Following standards for program exit code, 1 or greater means that something went wrong during execution. 0 means that everything went well during execution. Therefore, the variable defaults to 1 because you do not want your code to say that all went well when it actually did not. It is better to have a false failure and it get noticed than to have a false success and it go undetected. Conclusion If you are going to copy the code of others, please be sure to review it first before using it as it may have defects already in it. If you do not know what the code does, then spend a few moments searching for those commands or snippets online so that you learn what they do.

Video Video Transcript what's going on YouTube family so in this video I'm gonna actually to set up the automatic updates using unattended upgrades on Ubuntu 18.04 so let's get to it thanks for checking out the almost engineer channel if you are visiting for the first time please be sure to subscribe by clicking subscribe button below so automatic updates is a feature available in Ubuntu similar to Windows has Windows updates where it basically up stations the system automatically with little to no effort on your part and so the default setup for automatic updates is that it only updates these security packages however I actually wanted to get it to update everything on the system and so what I'm gonna do is actually run through a number of steps and these steps are available on my website as well as the Ubuntu - Help section of the Ubuntu - website on how to configure some of this so the first thing you'll need to do is to run sudo apt-get install unattended upgrades and I already have that installed it's pretty common I think it's installed by default when you install Ubuntu 18.04 so if you don't have it just run the install command it won't hurt if you already have it it'll tell you you already have it alright so the next thing you go to CD Etsy apt apt Kampf daddy alright and then in this directory there are two files that we're going to edit so the first one is going to be the 50 unattended upgrades and then the next one is going to be the 20 auto upgrades so you're gonna need to sudo for this so 50 unattended upgrades looks like I have a whole backup file I'll probably come back and remove that point so alright do VI and as you see here so there are comments in this file and so basically by defaults like I mentioned it will only install security updates but I want to actually install like general updates as well so I'm going to remove the double slashes here and then do WQ actually gonna go out and open nano you can still do this in VI but nano I'm more familiar with the shortcuts for nano so alright so we've removed the comments for the just standard updates I don't want the proposed or backports consultant unnecessarily stable updates so you only want the stuff that's actually stable so going down if you there are packages that you want to exclude you can uncomment these usually I would leave these as are as they are because you never know when update may happen for those you want the latest version the next option mentions whether you want the development release of Ubuntu to be automated oh great I'm going to leave that at false I want to make sure that I have the latest stable version not the development version so again I'm leaving that one at false all right the next option says that it allows you to control if on an unclean dpkg exit understand the upgrades will automatically run the default is true to ensure that your updates keep getting installed so I will leave that at true so I'll relieve this since this mine is coming it I'll leave that as is alright split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that they can be interrupted with sig term this makes the upgrade a bit slower it has to benefit that shut down while the upgrade is running is possible I'm gonna leave that at false again it's not necessarily but if you need to have that done you can uncomment this and go forward the next option install all unintended upgrades when the machine is shutting down instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running this will obviously make shutdown slower I'm going to leave that commented because I don't when I shut down a system I wanted to go ahead and shut down I don't want it to continue to go ahead and try to install the updates while shutting down all right the next option is to send the email to this address for problems or packages upgrade so basically if there's a problem you'll get an email which also means you also need to have a mail server setup and so since I do development on this particular machine I don't want to setup a mail server to prevent some of those development actions from sending out emails because sometimes you know when you're developing you build our email functionality and the last thing you want is to have a email going out to a actual human user you know in your development face all right so removed used kernels you'll want to let's see I want to uncomment this one and the reason I'm I'm coming this one is uncomment and gonna set this to true and the reason I'm doing that is because of the fact I want the kernel packages removed if you don't remove kernel packages what will happen over time is that the disk space will eventually started getting used up significantly because kernel packages are relatively big on a Linux system and so I went through one day and I actually had about 15 or 20 gigs of packages just sitting that were no longer the latest version so it's like if it's not the latest version why do I still have it and so I removed it so this will handle that automatically so you don't have to manually do it alright the next one do automatic removal of new unused dependency after the upgrade so which is the equivalent of running app get out of remove I do want that and I'm going to uncomment it and then also set it to the true automatically reboot without confirmation and so basically if it finds the reboot file then you wanted to reboot I am leave that one set at false well actually I take that back I'm actually changed this to true because the system does need to reboot I wanted to go ahead and reboot to apply those changes and then the next option I wanted to reboot to am is pretty decent for my particular situation you know at 2:00 a.m. I'm usually not doing anything there may be a chance where a automation of some sort is running in the background not on this particular machine but just in general so this should be sufficient in my opinion all right if you want to set a bandwidth limit you can uncheck this setting frankly I do not care about the bandwidth limit so I believe that as is if you want logging you can set that up I'm gonna leave it as false same thing for the syslog facility download operates only on AC power this particular machine only runs off of AC power there is no battery connected to it so no sense of setting it up because it will always need to be run and then last option is to download and install it grace only on non meter connections I believe that one commented if you're using like a Wi-Fi hotspot or something of that similar nature you'll want to consider enabling this option that way you're not installing you know updates in using all of your allocated bandwidth all right so I'm going to save that file now and the next file I will need to look at is also in the same directory it is the 2002 upgrades so open nano again if you want to use VI you can use VI but I'm using nano alright and so per the documentation on the Ubuntu website it mentions that there are a number of options that we can add in here and so update package lists that the one is already added and recommended to be done also the same thing for the unattended upgrade value set to one alright so the additional options are to add apt periodic and then Auto clean interval and set that a value to seven and so what this will do is it will clean up old download archives every week so again that's about the maintaining the space on the file system keeping it clean and then download upgradable packages is the other option that it mentions that is advisable to be included so you do a periodic download - upgradable packages and set that by you equal to one with a semicolon and then that is it for that one alright oops save then exit alright so once you have done that if you are using like version control for your SC directory you'll want to commit those changes so I'm going to go ahead and do that now at - ooh sudo get status just to confirm that those are added and sudo get commit and then we're going to do updated the unattended upgrade settings actually I need to change that to updated so go back alright and then for safekeeping I need to push that up alright so my commit has been pushed up so that this configuration change has now been saved and if something happens to this system in the future all I have to do is pull that configuration back down and it is good to go so hopefully this video has helped you in configuring your unattended upgrade set up on your Ubuntu to 18.04 machine if you have any questions or you know have any differences in the process of how you use unattended upgrades leave a comment in the comment section below also please be sure to check out my website they almost engineer comm

reboot to apply those changes and then the next option I wanted to reboot to am is pretty decent for my particular situation you know at 2:00 a.m. I'm usually not doing anything there may be a chance where a automation of some sort is running in the background not on this particular machine but just in general so this should be sufficient in my opinion all right if you want to set a bandwidth limit you can uncheck this setting frankly I do not care about the bandwidth limit so I believe that as is if you want logging you can set that up I'm gonna leave it as false same thing for the syslog facility download operates only on AC power this particular machine only runs off of AC power there is no battery connected to it so no sense of setting it up because it will always need to be run and then last option is to download and install it grace only on non meter connections I believe that one commented if you're using like a Wi-Fi hotspot or something of that similar nature you'll want to consider enabling this option that way you're not installing you know updates in using all of your allocated bandwidth all right so I'm going to save that file now and the next file I will need to look at is also in the same directory it is the 2002 upgrades so open nano again if you want to use VI you can use VI but I'm using nano alright and so per the documentation on the Ubuntu website it mentions that there are a number of options that we can add in here and so update package lists that the one is already added and recommended to be done also the same thing for the unattended upgrade value set to one alright so the additional options are to add apt periodic and then Auto clean interval and set that a value to seven and so what this will do is it will clean up old download archives every week so again that's about the maintaining the space on the file system keeping it clean and then download upgradable packages is the other option that it mentions that is advisable to be included so you do a periodic download - upgradable packages and set that by you equal to one with a semicolon and then that is it for that one alright oops save then exit alright so once you have done that if you are using like version control for your SC directory you'll want to commit those changes so I'm going to go ahead and do that now at - ooh sudo get status just to confirm that those are added and sudo get commit and then we're going to do updated the unattended upgrade settings actually I need to change that to updated so go back alright and then for safekeeping I need to push that up alright so my commit has been pushed up so that this configuration change has now been saved and if something happens to this system in the future all I have to do is pull that configuration back down and it is good to go so hopefully this video has helped you in configuring your unattended upgrade set up on your Ubuntu to 18.04 machine if you have any questions or you know have any differences in the process of how you use unattended upgrades leave a comment in the comment section below also please be sure to check out my website they almost engineer comm and you can follow me

of Mkdocs, is that if you do not provide a navigation path in the mkdocs.yml file, that it will build the website based on the file structure.

Most blogging tools, have the most recent content listed first and the oldest last.

However, like any piece of software, it has to be regularly worked on in order to stay up to date. Thus I looked into switching over to a static website. Static websites are now starting to make a comeback. As you may know, the early dates of websites were mostly comprised of static websites. Over time, then need for information to be delivered faster, items to be purchased online, and individuals wanting to have their own online space, resulted in more dynamic tools being created. Here are the pros and cons that I discovered when researching to switch to a static website. The Pros No Database A static website does not have a need for a database. When you have less infrastructure to maintain, you are free to do other things. With Drupal, if your database goes down, becomes corrupt, or gets hacked, your website will have reduced or no functionality. In addition, you have to keep regular backups of your database in case something does happen to it. I had one of the Drupal websites that I maintain get hacked once. It took a lot of effort to clean up the database after the successful hacking attempt. In addition, the most recent backup, was approximately 6 months or more old. So the changes had taken place since then, which were not tracked, would have been lost and probably not restored. Drupal Security Updates Drupal releases security and feature updates regularly. When the updates are released, they are included in the weekly email newsletter that goes out. In one occurrence, the weekly newsletter went out and a Drupal-based website was exploited within hours based on the details that were provided in the newsletter. This means you have to be immediately ready to download, test, and deploy the latest security patches. Otherwise you are putting your website at risk. I'm only one person and not always have time to make an update as soon as it comes out. For me, performing these code updates are not difficult. However, performing those updates does take time. Time away from writing content, sleep, or doing something more useful with your time. Speed Counts A static website will always be faster than a website that uses a database. The way that Drupal is setup, the database would been called each time a page was accessed. From there, the database would returned a cached version of the page. Load times is one of the factors that Google takes into account when it comes to search ranking. So the faster your page loads, the higher your ranking on search engines. Harder To Hack Content Management Systems usually have a way to login to them. This \"doorway\" for login allows hackers or similar users to gain access to your website and make changes. Static websites do not have login or authentication system. Now I know what you're saying... you can hack the webhost directly. Yes that is true, but you have the know the name of the webhost server. Most of the time, the website does not have the name as the web server, thus making it more difficult to access and hack. The Cons You Have to Rebuild the Entire Website One downside to using Mkdocs, is that when you make one change, you have to rebuild the entire website. There's no way, that I am aware of, that will allow you to update and deploy a single page. This is one of the common complaints that I have read about Mkdocs and other static site generators. At the time, it is not a big deal for me to use a static site generator as I do not have a lot of content. I did read that one website had over 1,500 posts and that it took two hours to generate the entire website using Jekyll. Limited Themes I looked for themes to use that were similar to my current website. Let's just say that there was not many. After doing several searches and finding other blogs that used Mkdocs, I found and chose the Material theme for my blog. It allows you to do some appearance customizations without having to do significant code changes to the theme. Conclusion Hopefully this provides you with insight on whether you should consider changing your website over to a static website.","title":"Switched Blog from Drupal to MkDocs"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#the-pros","text":"","title":"The Pros"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#no-database","text":"A static website does not have a need for a database.

The conversion that I did for my website, took about 30-40 hours. That was a combination of a few evenings after work and a full weekend. To give you a perspective, I only had about 120 nodes on my Drupal site that had to be converted. Some of the more recent nodes, were already in Markdown format, so only formatting and presentation changes needed to be made. The other nodes were in various formats, including plain text and HTML (filter and full). Do The Setup In order to create a website with MkDocs, you will need to do some initial setup . I did my updates on Ubuntu. Therefore I was able to run sudo apt-get install mkdocs and the rest was done auto-magically. Setup is similar for Mac users. Windows users, you\u2019ll need to install Python and then the MkDocs pip package. Instructions on how to do this are available on the MkDocs website . Stop Creating Content Similar to how difficult it is to drain a bath tub if the water is still running, you will need to stop creating content until you do your migration. Otherwise, you will never complete the conversion process. I will admit, I did write two new posts while going through the conversion process. One about switching to Markdown and MkDocs and the other about raking leaves . Those posts, were written in new site that I was actively working on and not deployed to the old site since it was on the way to the digital landfill. Backup and Export The Database Before you start messing with your content, make a backup of the database and your website code and put it on a system that you will not be working on. That way if you do something wrong (yes it happened several times), then you have something that you can redo your changes from. I copied the production database of my website, as well as the master branch of code to my development server. Then I performed all of the updates in my development environment. I did it this way because that allows my website to continue to remain active. Also, in the worse case of making mistakes, which did happen, those mistakes were not seen by end users as only I have access to my development server. Convert Tables to Markdown Next was to get the posts and other website content into Markdown format. As previously mentioned, some of the content was written in HTML or plain text formats. What I chose to do was to write some database queries that would format the existing data into or close to the format that I wanted the markdown file to be in. The final output was contained in a column in a temporary table that I was using to make the necessary changes ad adjustments. The queries that I used to make this update are in the SQL file located at https://github.com/almostengr/almostengrwebsite/tree/master/migration_scripts . Using a number of update statements, I was able to convert the HTML syntax to Markdown. Some of the tags were too complex to convert, so I left those in the database and fixed them after I did the export to a text file. Export the Markdown Next, I did an export of the data to a CSV file. Now I only exported the column that had the finalized output and the title of each post. I did this using PHPMyAdmin as I have a MySQL database installed. Be sure to select the option that removes the carriage returns and line breaks from the export. After that, I assembled a command that would read each line in the CSV file, take the first column of the CSV file and put it into the body of the Markdown file and take the second column of the CSV file and use it to name the CSV file. This was done through the use of a while loop and the awk command. Take a look at csv_to_individual_files.sh script in the migration_scripts directory. After that, I did the file cleanup. The file clean up removed the additional characters that were present from the CSV file as well as converted the line breaks (<br /> tags) to new line characters. This way the final file will will not be one long line. Copy Images and Supporting Files Next, I copied the images that were used on my Drupal site into an images directory. I put all of the images into a single directory. Then I had to update the Markdown files to use relative paths to these files. Now you can use absolute references to the files, but that may cause you to miss errors when you are developing new content as you will need to use production URLs when setting up the links. If you do not have the image in production when creating new content, you will get no image or the alternate text for that image. Structure and Configure Your Website Blog Categories How you structure your website can make a big difference when it comes to SEO and user experience. When I used Drupal, all I had to do was select the appropriate taxonomy category and the URL part was handled. With the Markdown site, I\u2019m having to do the structure manually. I found it best to place each post in a folder based upon the category that it was intended for. In addition, I named each file with the date that I created the article and the title of the article. By having this information in the URL, it better helps the search engines index my blog. My folders tree looks similar to the following: docs | index.md | 2018 | 2018.02.13-use-twitter-and-rules-for-farmos-notifications/ | 2018.01.23-raspitraffic-demo,-us-signaling/ | 2018.01.16-raspberry-pi-first-run-and-installing-updates/ | 2019 | 2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.20-blog-reverse-sort-with-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps Sort by Date One of the downfalls to using Markdown, is that it sorts by alphabetical and numeric order. Meaning that my oldest posts would show up first. Nobody wants to have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the latest post that you wrote. What I needed up having to do was to leverage the find , sort , and sed commands to list the files in reverse order. Once I got them in the most recent post first order, I put them into the MkDocs configuration file (mkdocs.yml). After they were in the configuration file, then I added group headings based on the categories. The code that I used for this is available in the sort_by_latest_post.sh file in the migration_scripts directory. Proofread, Proofread, Proofread I went through each of the posts and attempted to correct as many of the formatting and Markdown errors that I could. Some of the errors, I realized were due to a lack of formatting that was done during the database step. So I truncated the temporary table and updated the update database query so that the additional formatting changes could be applied there instead of having to use sed or some other command via the terminal. Some of the HTML formatting I could not remove because of some of the difficulties of trying to match some particular text. So I left it in place for it to be manually modified. As I mentioned earlier, I only had about 120 pages that I had to go through and correct. If you have a blog with thousands or more posts, you may want to have a team help you or build more queries that will make the necessary code updates before deploying. Deploy To Production Not Exactly Perfect Once I was satisfied, I deployed it to production. There are some articles that do not have images contained in them because the image link is incorrect. There are other images that are way too large for the post, and I will need to resize them to make them more appropriate. I will do that at a later date. I deployed my updated site by using the mkdocs gh-deploy command. This creates a separate branch on your repo to deploy to. Then it will generate the static files for your website and push those files to the gh-pages branch. Set up Automated Pull or CI I added a cron job on my production instance that will periodically pull the latest version of the gh-pages to the production server. This will eliminate my need to login to the production instance unless there is a critical failure with the script or something else goes wrong. If you are not able to do a cron job, you can also use a CI server that will do the production deployment for you. Travis is one that is popular to use with Github. Conclusion I am happy with the new setup. The biggest advantage is that I do not have to spend time performing module updates or backups of the Drupal database. Further more, the simplicity of writing blog posts much better as I do not need specialized tools to complete the task.","title":"Blog Conversion Steps"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps/#blog-conversion-steps","text":"If you read my previous post , you found out why I chose to migrate away from a CMS (Content Management System).

When I explained the type of work that I did, I often related it to calling customer service when your internet or electricity goes out and you call to report them problem. I was a Level 2 agent for 5 years and then Level 1.5 agent for 2 years (L1.5 is a role they made up to keep providing services for the client). During this time period, I learned a lot as well as demonstrated skills that others had not seen before. Hopefully my experiences that I share, help you be successful in your role. 1) Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire I worked several issues that required to have the client involved in fixing the issue or the issue was reported by the client. In some of those situations, when the client was asked when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it would be like 3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself, wanted to stay at work later than necessary. In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that was next to a dry wooded wilderness (meaning it was not serious at the moment but had the potential to be). If the deadline that was given to you seems unrealistic to accomplish, ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the right questions, there is a change that, you will have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want, or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening. 2) Work Your Hours and Leave If you do not have an on call rotation for your job, you may skip this section. During my entire time in this role, I had to be on call. There was a primary on call rotation, but they were responsible for the initial triage of tickets that were sent to our group. It was never stated, but everyone was on call all the time for the respective applications that he or she supported. Initially I would sometimes work additional hours in addition to the time being on call. After experiencing some burnout of working 50 and 60+ hour weeks, that changed quickly. My perspective became that I would work the required 40 hours per week and on call as scheduled, but that was it. While some issues were quick to fix, other issues would take days to fix because of their complexity or effort required. Because of these reasons and more, I worked the minimum amount of hours, as you never know when that major production issue will come in. If it comes in and you already have 50+ hours clocked for the week, you will experience burnout and make more mistakes due to fatigue and lack of sleep. Example There was two week span that several major issues occurred for the applications that I was the primary and secondary support for. I had to step up and work both, as the primary for the application that I was the secondary support for, was on vacation. Somewhere during that second week, I made a mistake in resolving one of the issues, which resulted in more work having to be done. My manager had to explain this mistake to the client manager and the client manager asked why I was making these kind of mistakes given that it was not the first time that I had worked on this type of issue and that I was experienced with the clients' systems. My manager relayed this question to me and I did not know why. It occurred to me in hindsight that it was exhaustion from the additional hours having to be worked and doing double the work that I would normally do. Example Had a production issue come in for one of my applications while I was working my normal hours for the day. This issue required manually rolling back the data that had been loaded due to bad formatting of the data file. There were some time constraints also, because there was a monthly process that ran related to the client billing their clients. It had to be done and I was the one that had to do it. In total, I spent over 20+ hours being awake and worked at least a good 16 hours on this single issue. I was glad when the issue was resolved and received no push back on requesting the day off on short notice. 3) Documentation One thing that I have learned is that documentation is an essential part of working in production support and help desk environments. If someone cannot understand what is written, then it does not have any use. If You Can't Explain It To A Six Year Old Einstein has been claimed to have said that \"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself\". One of the managers had a similar phrase about if a random person off the street cannot do the steps in the document correctly, then the document was not well written. I agree with both of these statements. The last thing that you want to do is be contacted to resolve an issue that you already wrote documentation for it being misunderstood. If you write a document, and you are the only one that understands what is being done in the document and how to properly perform the steps in the document, that document needs to be redone. Screenshots When I first started writing documentation for our Level 1 support group, I would just write the steps or commands to be executed. After a few mishaps with the Level 1 Support team performing steps, I started to include a screenshot of each step being performed. Did this help reduce the number of errors? Yes it did. In some cases, certain tickets never got escalated to me because the document covered all scenarios and was through. If the command was copied and pasted incorrectly (usually due to the documentation website adding special characters or copying text from a Word document and pasting it directly into a Unix or Linux session) or they did not see the button on the screen that they were to click, they could use the screenshot to verify what it should look like on the screen before reporting it as bad documentation. Good clear instructions with screenshots of the step to perform will reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the human errors that occur with resolving tickets. Find and RTFM (Read The Freaking Manual) Larger vendors provide a manual or some kind of documentation for their products. At one point during my career, the client did a major upgrade of Autosys. It was a significant upgrade as they were going from Autosys 4 to Autosys 11. That big of an upgrade meant that there was limited backwards capabilities. From what I understand, no or limited documentation was provided to the development teams and little training was provided to the support teams. I took it upon myself to find the documentation for the new version that was being upgraded to, as I looking to making adjustments to some jobs that were already in place. Over time, the conversion from one version to the next did cause some production issues. By having the latest Autosys manual document provided by the vendor, I was able to help resolve some of the issues that occurred with the transition. In addition, I was asked to share it with the developers and other support teams because they wanted to see what was different and to be able to get more out of the new system. 4) How to Automate If an issue is recurring and can be automated, then I would suggest that you automate it. Some people freak-out at the thought of automating things because they feel that if you automate enough, you will automate yourself out of a job. From my experience, that was far from the truth. Automating helped reduce the amount of hours that I worked outside of normal business hours. Writing Code You need to know how to write code. Even if you are not great at it, being able to automate mundane, repetitive tasks will save you lots of time over the duration of your career. From writing code from scratch, to pasting bits and pieces of code from Stack overflow and other websites, you can improve your efficiencies and productivity by automating. If you do not know how to code, you can learn how to do so in your free time. What language should you learn? That depends on what languages or systems that you client uses. As mentioned earlier, mine used Linux, Oracle, and other systems, so I became proficient in writing Shell Scripts and using SQL Plus, just to name a couple. Example After a realignment of the team, I became the primary support for a new set of applications. One of those applications had a process that ran on the last three days of the month and the first of the month. Part of that process was that it wrote the date of the first of the month to that file. Problem was that when the process ran on the first of the month, the date was supposed to be for the previous month. For instance, if it was the end of October or the first of November, then we had to make sure that the date in the file was for the first of October. Come to find out, this was a bug that the development team had made a change to, but regression testing was not performed on it. The development team did not consider it urgent as there was a work around available and the business team had back log items that had to be completed by a particular deadline. What was being done by the agent that previously supported the application is that he was getting up in the early hours of the morning, around 1 AM, to manually update the date in the file and start the process. Once I took over the application, I had to start doing the same. What I would do is work my normal shift and then stay up until 1 AM to make the update and start the process as I did not want to sleep through the alarm as this process not running would have a major business impact. After about the third month, I had had enough of doing that and looked into automating it. What the previous agent and myself came up with was a shell script that would run at 1 AM, check the current date, and based on a number of if conditions, write the appropriate date to the file. After a confirmation run of the fix, this fix was presented to the development team. As a result, the development team added it to the code base. Also I did not have to stay up late nights on the first of the month just to edit a text file. 5) Jump the Firewall In some companies, the technology used is so specific to and designed just for that organization, that there are no resources outside of the company that can help resolve or diagnose issues. This is a difficult for individuals that provide support for these components. Other companies do use more name brand technology products, like Oracle, Java, or Linux. There is plenty of documentation on how to use these products and what the error message or exception messages mean and resolution steps. Keep the Privates, Private Going outside of the firewall was frowned upon in some situations as you could risk putting NPI (Non Public Information) or company secrets into the public. I am not suggesting that you ever submit private data or company secrets on a form on the public internet as you do not know where that information will end up. Errors and How To Do I am saying that you can look up an error message to find the answer to a problem that you are having to quickly resolve issues. As I mentioned earlier, the less issues that you have to deal with, the more time that you have to work on other things. This applies to non production issues and items. 6) Share What You Know There is a common notion that if you share what you know, then somebody else can do what you know how to do and then you will be out of a job. While in some industries, that may be true, from my experience it is false. My experience has been that if you know, that allows others to do what you do and allows you to do more and new things. When I worked on tickets that came in, I was sure to include SQL queries, SSH session logs, application logs, and any other information that I used to resolve an issue. Why? Because the last thing I want to have happen, is to get called for an issue when I am on vacation or to have the on-call person call me to resolve an issue that's simple as restarting a process. In some situations, the on-call person was able to resolve the current occurrence of an issue, based on the previous occurrence of an issue that had my notes and other information attached. Example One of the applications (App A) that I supported, was upgraded and set up on a new virtual machine (Server A). As part of the new VM setup, it also got a new IP address. The old server (Server B) was powered down. An interfacing system (App B) was not able to connect to App A. The individual that was the support contact for App B, said that he could not connect to App A from his computer or App B server. I checked the server for App A, and App A was online and running as it should be. After discussing the issue, we compared the IP address that App B had and the IP address that Server B currently had. Come to find out, App B had cached the IP address for Server B for App A. Since Server B was offline as it had been replaced by Server A, App B was saying that it could not connect to App A. It was at this point, I had to tell support agent for App B that he had to clear the DNS cache for App B and then try to connect again. He was not familiar with this so he had to reach out someone else to provide him the info on how to do this. Once he cleared the cache and restarted the process, the connection was successful. He was able to document those steps so that if the issue were to happen again in the future, that he would be prepared and not have to get additional people involved. 7) Minimize Distractions One thing that I have learned, is that modern work environment is not really conducive to getting a lot of work done. I have discovered that some people come to work extra early or stay extra late because they can get work done without being interrupted. What I had to start doing was to minimize the amount of distractions that were coming my way. Visual Distractions That notification that you got an email. That notification of a new instant message. That notification that there are updates for your computer. Turn them all off. If the email is that important, the sender will let you know by following up immediately. If the IM (instant message) is that important, they would have called or came directly to your desk. You can install the updates to your computer when you do not have to be actively working or after you leave for the day. Audio Distractions When I worked, I would listen to music or even audio books to block out the sounds of other people eating, gossiping, on meetings, or the toilet flushing. Sometimes the work required deep focus, such as analyzing the data in a spreadsheet or writing code for the automation that you are trying to build (see item 4). Email Management Email is one of those things that can easily get on your nerves. I had to leverage a number of built in features that Outlook has to get the most of out my email and scheduling. Rules and Categories Set up rules and categories in outlook based on keywords or senders that you get emails from. If you get emails that you know does not require you to read or perform any action on, then create a rule that will automatically send those emails to the trash. Create Meetings from Email Did you know that you can create a meeting invite from an email? What's more cool, is that the invite will have all of the people that were on the email included in it. All you have to do is open the email that you want to create a meeting for, click the \"Meeting\" button in the toolbar. The Meeting Request screen will appear so that you can finalize the details. Then you click Send. Group Conversations By grouping the email conversations by subject, it made it far easier for me to get through all of the emails that were in my inbox. If there was a email thread that I did not need to read or pay attention to, then I could delete the entire thread in a single actions since the thread was grouped together. Conclusion Working in the production support / help desk role can be difficult and very stressful at times. Hopefully these tips have provided you some strategies on how to make your help desk / support role easier to deal with.","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#7-lessons-learned-as-production-support-or-help-desk-agent","text":"","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#background","text":"I worked for 7 years in Production Support role.

In the process, I came across one user that had a \"uses\" page on his website. On this page, he stated that he was inspired by Wes Bos to create a uses page. Wes Bos created a website called uses.tech that is a collection of the users that have submitted their uses page to his repository. What Is A Uses Page? A uses page includes the things that a developer or other individual uses to do what they do best. For software developers, it may include the type of computer that they have, the IDE or text editor that they use, and the languages that they program with. How Do I Format My Uses Page? However you chose! When looking at other uses pages, I saw that some categorized their page based on the type of tools. Others categorized their set up in different ways. There is no particular way that it must be done other than the fact that you need to include the tools that you use. Some list out just the hardware and software that they use. Others get very detailed to include the hardware specifications, number of computers, and even photographing their home office or desk setup. Some even add the furniture that they have in their office as hardware components. You can look at the uses pages that have already been submitted on the uses.tech website for inspiration. On mine, I have included the software, computer hardware, and development environment details for my particular setup. Depending on what I am working on, I will use Linux or Windows. Therefore, I separated my software list by the operating system that I use it on. You can check out my uses page to see what my current set up includes. How Will Others Find My Uses Page? First you will need to create your uses page. Then, you will need to add it and other details about yourself to the awesome-uses repository. Once your pull request has passed all of the checks and is approved, your uses page will be listed on uses.tech website and in the README of the awesome-uses repository. How Did I Build My Uses Page? I came up with the organization of my uses page by doing the following in order: I looked at the Uses page of others that were listed on the uses.tech site as well as on GitHub to see what they included on their pages. I decided how I wanted to organize the content. Since I use multiple systems for my work, I decided to list each computer system or server as hardware and to separate the software by operating system. I also included the tools uses to build and manage this website. I provided links to some of the items that have websites for the products. That way visitors can download or purchase the same tools that you have. I published my uses page . I created an entry on the awesome-uses repo that pointed to the Uses page on my website. NOTE: I had some errors in my pull request to the awesome-uses repo. As a result, the CI would not allow my pull request to be sent for approval until I corrected the errors that it found.

Here are some of the main reasons for making the switch: Drupal 7 has been replaced with Drupal 8. That means the content would need to be migrated to the new platform. However, all the functionality may not be available, as some modules are still being converted to work on Drupal 8. Blogging with a static site puts you at less risk of hacking, encountering database issues, and page load speed. I discuss this further in another post weighing the pros and cons of switching. Old Process with Drupal Login to Drupal Had to login to Drupal each time that I wanted to make an update to my blog. This mean that I was less likely to make that update over public WiFi, because public WiFi means that your site could be a greater risk for being hacked. Ignore that Message About Security Updates Available Now I did not always ignore this message, but majority of the time I did. Why? Because when the thought of a new content came to mind, I wanted to get as much of the thought out of my head and onto digital paper as possible. Fooling around and trying to get those updates installed before getting the thoughts out meant that I would risk loosing the thought, thus no new content. On the other prospective, not getting those security updates in place would leave the site at risk . Write The Content... In A Word Processor I know it does not make sense, but let me explain. While some browsers do have spell check, I have not ran across one that has grammar check. That said, I know that I make mistakes typing and have to go back and correct those mistakes. However, I would rather to get it right the first time than to have to correct it in a future update or somebody telling me about my mistake. Move the Content to the Website Once I have done all the grammar and spell checking in the word processor, I would then copy and paste that content into the website and preview it. With previewing, it would allow me to see that the content was formatted correctly before publishing. Once I would confirm that all was well, then I would publish the content. Take a Backup Since things could go wrong with Drupal when performing the database updates, per the Drupal documentation, it was recommended that you always backed up the database before running the database updates function. I have had a few sites go wrong when performing the database updates and it was not easy getting them back online since I did not have recent backups. In some of the modules, the maintainers were not using database transactions in their update functions. So if part of the update ran and failed, you would have a partial-ran database update but Drupal would see it as if the full update had completed successfully. Problem with Drupal seeing it as the full update running, is that it would not let you re-run that specific update again. So that meant that you had to either tinker in the database and manually update the version number to the previous version so that the database update could be ran again or restore the database with the backup and run the update again. Either of those options were not ideal and definitely were time consuming. Those Security Updates If I was using the right computer, I would then download the available security updates into my development computer. Confirmed that nothing blew up in the process with Drupal's database updater. Then commit those updates to my website's version control. Then pull the latest version into my production environment and run Drupal's database updater and prayed the entire time that things would work as they should. New Process with MkDocs Fetch Latest Repo On any computer of my choosing that has git installed, I can get the latest the latest version of Markdown code of my website and make updates to it. Edit in Text Editor or Word Processor Since the content that I am going to edit is already on the computer, I do not have to do anything special to get them into a word processor for editing. It is just as simple as File > Open > select the file > start typing. Save and Commit Once I have made all of the edits that need to be made, I can save my changes in the word processor and then commit them to my version control. Then push that branch up to the origin. Generate Static Files and Deploy I have my development environment set up with MkDocs. So I login to that server and run the git pull command followed by mkdocs gh-deploy command. The static HTML, CSS, and JS files are generated and committed to a local branch and then I am prompted to enter by GitHub credentials. Automated Pull in Production My production instance has a cronjob set up that does a pull of the branch that contains the static website. It does this pull several times per day. In a sense, it it like having a CD (continuous deployment) set up in that environment. Future Considerations Expanded CI-CD Setup One of the future goals that I have is to expand my current deployment set up so that it will periodically pull the master branch and automatically run the gh-deploy command on it. I looked into having all of this done in my production environment, but my website host provider will not allow me to install Python packages on their shared server. Thus will have to continue to generate the static website files locally. GitHub Actions GitHub Actions allows you to do testing and deployment when an event occurs on your repository. For example, if you push code from your remote to the origin, GitHub Actions can be triggered to run tests on the operating system of your choosing with whatever else is required to complete the testing (Python install, PHP install, etc). Based upon what I currently have in place, it seems to be the more viable option. I already have a script that runs in my production environment that periodically pulls the static website pages. Thus I never have to login to production to deploy my website.

Thus the command below will change to the parent directory of the current directory. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd .. almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ pwd /home Each user has a home directory. To go back to your home directory, you enter the command below in. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ cd Creating New Folder To create a new folder, you use the command below. You will need to replace anewfolder with the name of the folder that you want to create. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ mkdir nanewfolder Once you have ran the command above, you can use the ls command to confirm that the folder has been created. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Predefined Aliases On some systems, the directories are highlighted a different color from the files. Ubuntu is one of the systems that does this out of the box. The reason is because there is an alias defined for the ls command. I showed what was really running when performing the ls by showing the alias. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias ls alias ls='ls --color=auto' Removing Folders and Files If you attempt to remove a directory without specifying the recursive option, the system will complain that the action cannot be done. The system will not allow you to delete a folder without deleting the child elements in that folder because that would leave the child elements orphaned on the system. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm anewfolder/ rm: cannot remove 'anewfolder/': Is a directory almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt The recursive option still must be used even if the directory is empty. This time the remove command is run with the recursive option and the folder is removed. The rm command does not return any output unless there is an error executing the command. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm -r anewfolder/ almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Below are examples of commands that you do not want to run. If you do run any of the commands, they will result in the entire file system being deleted. Some of these require that the executing user have sudo permissions. The commands in the example below have been commented out so that they cannot be intentionally run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -r /* almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -rf /* The equivalent of the above commands is going to the root / directory and running the commands below. The commands in the example have intentionally been commented out so that they cannot be easily run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd / almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ ls almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f f * To find all of the options an example of the rm command, you can enter in the the help argument to the command. The help page wil display different output depending on the distrubution of Linux that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ rm --help For more information about the command, you can use the man page. The output from this will vary depending on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ man rm Autocomplete can be used with the rm command as well. Just type part of the file name and double press the Tab key to have the system type the rest of the file or to present you with files that match the pattern. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm cop copiedfile.csv copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm copyofsample* copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt Below, I show that \"sample\" as the pattern matched two files. However, \" s e*\" matches three files. Using this wildcard pattern can result in you deleting files that you do not want to delete. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls *s*e* almostengr.txt copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt If you are not sure what all files will match a pattern, run the pattern of your choice with the ls command first before running the rm command. Recovering Deleted Files Recovering delete files on Linux is not an easy task unless you use a disk recovery utility. On Windows-based systems, when a file is deleted, it goes to the Recycle Bin. Linux has no concept of the Recycle Bin. There is a way that the Recycle Bin concept can be done. To set up your makeshift Recycle Bin on Linux, you can create an alias for the rm command or use a different alias that will move the file to a different directory instead of deleting the file. alias rm=\"mv $@ /var/tmp\" If you use the command above as an alias, any time that you use the rm command, it will move the file to the /var/tmp directory instead. Periodically, you will need to \"empty the trash\" by removing the files from the /var/tmp directory. Clear The Screen Clearing the screen will do what it says. The prompt will be moved to the top of the screen. On some systems, this will limit whether you can scroll back or not. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ clear Copying Files To display the help information for using the file copy, use the --help option. The help page will vary based on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp --help This is the list of directory contents before performing a file copy. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt If you do not remember the filename that you want to copy or the filename is long that you do not want to type it, then you can use auto-complete to have the system complete the filename for you. Start by typing part of the file name in the prompt. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p d Then double press the Tab key and you will get the following. data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy/ Since there are multiple matches for files that start with \"d\", the system will not automatically guess which one that you are trying to type. Instead it will list all of the files that match the criteria that you have defined so that you can pick which one. The same will happen now that we have typed \"data\" in the prompt as there are two files that being with \"data\" in this directory. From here we can type an additional character that matches the file that we want to use in our command and it will complete the rest of the filename. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data data2.csv data.csv \"data2.csv\" is the file that is being copied to \"copiedfile.csv\". To confirm that the file has been copied, we run the ls command with the file names that were used in the cp command as arguments to only show those two files. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data2.csv copiedfile.csv almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al data2.csv copiedfile.csv Since we used the -p option in our file copy, the original and copied file will have the same last modified date and time. -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 copiedfile.csv -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 data2.csv Going to copy the file that we created to another file. This time without using the preserve option. Also going to use the wild card with the ls command to show both files instead of specifying each file name. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp sample.txt copysofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al *sample* -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:15 copyofsample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Since the -p option was not used when copying the file, the copied file will have the current timestamp (22:15). Creating Files To create a file, you can use the touch command. The file will be created with the name that you provide. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ touch sample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al sample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Viewing File Contents There are many ways of viewing file contents. To display an entire file on the screen, you use cat . almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cat data2.csv id,first_name,last_name,email,region,country 1,Christian,Walls,non.hendrerit.id@a.net,Manitoba,Spain

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified. In most circumstances, this listing will not be useful as it will not have any of the date or time information presented. almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -1t mailcap systemd shells host.conf python sysctl.d tmpfiles.d legal rc0.d security groff networks rc1.d modules-load.d logcheck profile rc2.d dpkg polkit-1 manpath.config rc3.d alternatives subgid- pam.conf rc4.d skel subuid- bash.bashrc rc5.d vim kernel bash_completion rc6.d ssh pm mke2fs.conf logrotate.d ssl X11 zsh_command_not_found init.d localtime network updatedb.conf fail2ban timezone crypttab debconf.conf default sudoers.d acpi ucf.conf bash_completion.d dhcp apm hdparm.conf monit apparmor gss at.deny python2.7 hostname perl nanorc ld.so.cache locale.gen fonts magic update-motd.d subgid kernel-img.conf magic.mime cron.weekly subuid mtab libaudit.conf cron.daily gshadow terminfo gai.conf update-manager group vtrgb rsyslog.conf lvm shadow newt login.defs apparmor.d passwd python3 securetty apport netplan iproute2 sudoers ufw machine-id xdg sysctl.conf rsyslog.d pollinate cron.hourly crontab profile.d fstab cron.monthly overlayroot.conf cloud issue ca-certificates.conf logrotate.conf vmware-tools issue.net modules deluser.conf pam.d os-release nsswitch.conf rmt cryptsetup-initramfs lsb-release ca-certificates debian_version mdadm passwd- dbus-1 inputrc modprobe.d shadow- adduser.conf sos.conf cron.d hosts.allow resolv.conf protocols iscsi hosts.deny environment rpc initramfs-tools NetworkManager ld.so.conf.d services console-setup dnsmasq.d selinux ltrace.conf grub.d rcS.d opt mailcap.order udev dnsmasq.d-available hosts mime.types python3.6 group- update-notifier bindresvport.blacklist ldap gshadow- ethertypes ld.so.conf thermald byobu landscape screenrc depmod.d popularity-contest.conf wgetrc fuse.conf networkd-dispatcher calendar binfmt.d apt libnl-3 locale.alias Listing Only Directories You can list only the directories using the ls command.

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified.

From there, I was able to find some of the documentation on how to use the values and variables in a template. Since I was creating a website with a blog, I wanted to sort the content by the most recent first. The problem with this is that using the for function, it would sort the content from oldest to newest. Again, I could not figure out how to reverse the order as this was not documented in the Jinja documentation where I could find it nor was it on Stack Overflow. Out on a limb, I typed the below and believe it or not, it sorted the content in reverse order just like how I wanted it to. {% for nav_item in nav | reverse %} /// whatever you want to loop over {% endfor %} The Break Down Let's break down the parts of the code. Start The Loop {% for This denotes the beginning of the for loop. The space between the parenthesis and the word \"for\" is required. Otherwise the command will not be intepreted as you expect and thus not work. Iterator Variable nav_item In this example, the \"nav_item\" is the name of the variable that is used within the for loop. For those of you that are familiar with writing foreach loops in Java or C#, \"i\" is commonly used for this same purpose. foreach(item in collection){ // do something } \"item\" in the example above would be the same as \"nav_item\" in Jinja example. Collection or Array \"nav\" is the collection or array of items that will be looped over one by one. This variable can be changed to loop over other items that are available, such as page variables or configuration variables. Reverse The Items | reverse This part of the command, will sort the items in the collection or array in reverse. If your items are sorted by date, then the most recent date would be first. If your items are sorted by alphabet, then the end of the alphabet (\"Z\") would be first. Close The Loop {% endfor %} This closes the end of the for loop.

PEACE OUT [MUSIC]","title":"Video Transcript"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.13-civicrm-cron-job-script-with-wordpress/","text":"To make CiviCRM work in Wordpress, you need to have cronjobs scheduled on your system to run to certain intervals. Otherwise you have to manually run these task which will increase your manual workload. In this video, I show you how to set up this automated process. Video Video Transcript AS PART OF THE CONVERSION OF MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS I ALSO INSTALLED CIVI CRM AND SO SYMPATHY RM REQUIRES A CRON TASK OR A ROUTINE SCHEDULER THAT KICKS OFF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE PROCESSES WHETHER HOURLY OR DAILY AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE A SHELL SCRIPT AS WELL AS DOWNLOADED THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TOOL THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO ALL OF THAT SO I'M GOING TO COVER THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS VIDEO WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO ONCE AGAIN SO HERE WE HAVE THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I CREATED FOR RUNNING CIVI CRM CRIME AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN SUPER CRM YOU HAVE A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE PROCESSES THERE PREFER TO AS SCHEDULED TASKS AND THE SYSTEM EXCUSE ME SCHEDULED JOBS AND SO I'M GOING TO ADMINISTER SYSTEM SETTINGS AND SCHEDULED JOBS WILL BRING YOU TO THIS PAGE AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS TASKS SUCH AS CLEANING IT UP TEMPORARY DATA CHECKING FOR UPDATES CHECKING EMAILS WHETHER IT'S PROCESSING EMAILS OR FETCHING EMAILS THAT HAVE BOUNCED FROM YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SO THEY RUN AT VARIOUS INTERVALS AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CIVI CRM REQUIRES THAT YOU SET UP A TASK SCHEDULER OR A CRON JOB AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT THAT COULD BE DONE USING THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE TOOL AND SO IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CIVI CRM WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS CV DOT FAR FILE OR CAR I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PH IS FAR FAR FAR AWAY AND SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN VARIOUS THINGS IN CIVI CRM AND PERFORM VARIOUS ACTIONS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE THE WP COMMAND LINE OR WORDPRESS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO RUN IT AND IT GIVES YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO IF YOU RUN IT LIKE I JUST DID HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN PHP AND THEN PASS THE FILE NAME AS A ARGUMENT TO THE PHP CALL BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY A PHP SCRIPT OF SORTS AND SO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE YOU CAN MAKE CALL TO THE APIS YOU CAN CALL THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS HERE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RUN THE CRIME PROCESS AND SO I HAVE THAT POOL OF DUCK AND SO HERE IS THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I HAVE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION YOU CAN GO TO THE REPOSITORY FOR MY WEBSITE I HAVE A LINK TO THE POSIT OR E DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW AND YOU CAN MAKE A COPY OF THIS SCRIPT AND SO BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHECKS IT STARTS OFF WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THIS URL PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I GOT THE CONCEPT OF HOW TO BUILD THIS SCRIPT OUT BUT IT STARTS WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THE REASON I PUT THE CURRENT DATE IN HERE IS SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN IT STARTED AND WHEN THEY END IT I'LL PROBABLY MAKE SOME MORE ADJUSTMENT TO THIS BEFORE ACTUALLY ROLLING IT OUT TO MY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ARGUMENT ONE IS NOT EMPTY AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE ARGUMENT 1 IS GOING TO BE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY OF WHERE THIS WHERE YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE WORDPRESS IS ON THE FILE SYSTEM IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO FROM THERE DOWN INTO THE FILE SYSTEM TO THE CIVIC CRM STUFF TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE NECESSARY COMMANDS THAT IT HAS TO RUN AND SO WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES IT JUST PRINTS OUT THE PATH THAT WAS PASSED IN AS ARGUMENT 1 TO THE

Transcript"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.16-college-programming-course-files-on-github/","text":"Background As I was cleaning off files on my computer recently, I found files that I had from college. Some of these files were from the classes that I took. Some are from the classes that others took and I helped them with their coursework. I figured I would share this code online for several reasons. I outline these reasons below and provide a warning for students that are currently in college. Reason 1: Reference Material When you get started in your career after college, sometimes you may want to refer to those programs or code that you wrote in college. Sometimes the code or components that I used, like a regular expression that validates email addresses that I used in my MIS 320 Application Design class, still works today. I will be honest, I have never sourced that expression from my old code, but I do remember it being there and could use it if I needed to. Reason 2: See Your Growth In order to see how much you have improved in your skills, you need to have evidence of what you previously did ( see Reason 1 ). By saving my work from when I was in college, I am now able to see how I previously wrote code. When I was in college, Visual Basic and C++ were the primary languages being taught. As I am writing this post in 2020, the primary languages that are being used are C#, Python, Java, and Python. If you are writing new code in Visual Basic, you will probably get laughed at or questioned unless you are writing a macro for a Microsoft Office program or something similar. Technology Shift As you can see, what were the primary languages circa 2010 and what they are circa 2020, have changed. This change is in part, has been because technology has moved towards using more web-based applications instead of desktop applications, increased use of technology on mobile devices, and designing applications and websites that work on multiple platforms. Reason 3: Portfolio Once you get close to graduation, you will begin to look for a job in your field. More and more employers are more concerned with the work experience that you have instead of your GPA or the institution that you attended. Why is the case? In some schools, it is easy to cheat and pass a class. While cheating can get you suspended or expelled (there were some in my classes that did get caught), learning how the tools used to detect cheating can be scapegoated. Long story short, you can pass a class and not learn anything from said class. When you talk about your experience, sometimes they will ask to see your work. As I have previously conducted interviews in the past, the reason that the interviewer wants to see your existing code or to write out code in an interview, is not necessarily to see if you will get the coding problem correct. It is to see how you think and whether you understand coding design patterns. Why Not Focus on Getting Coding Problems Right? There are many ways to write code. For example, in C# (C-Sharp), which of the following code blocks is correctly written? int x = 1; Figure 1 int x; x = 1; Figure 2 Some would say that both are correct because they do the same thing. Figure 2 takes more steps to accomplish the same task. Some would say that Figure 1 is correct because the code is more concise. In my opinion, they are both correct for the reasons stated. However, if you are following design patterns and principles like SOLID and DRY, you would know that Figure 1 is the best way of writing this code. Experience vs. Grades Please do not mistaken what I mean when I say that experience is more important than grades. That does not mean that you can fail your classes and still be successful. While grades do not necessarily reflect ones skill set (because of built in biases in exams and curriculum), they do reflect the level of commitment that an individual had during their collegiate tenure. Experience is valued more because you have demonstrated your knowledge in a given subject. What are examples of experience that you can gain? Interships Both paid and not paid count. This will give you the least experience points because they are only done for short amounts of time (usually during the summer). Co-op . This is a program where the college or university partner with a company that allow you get on the job training and work while enrolled in school. This offers you greater experience points in my opinion as you usually work for an entire year full time (alternating school semesters). Running a business Want to build websites for a living? Then starting a business doing that is the best way to gain experience. The involvement required to run a business, will earn you way more experience points of all because you have to have multiple skillsets to run a business. Word of Caution If you are currently enrolled in school, I would not suggest that you post the code that you are working on online until after the end of the semester or school year. Why not? I have ran across some Reddits and forums that mention how some students posted their homework online. Then one of their classmates did a search and was able to find it, copy it, and turn it in. It was all downhill from there. Online Situation In one instance, the original writer of the code posted asking what he should do about his situation. The teacher ran the code through a plagiarism tool. This tool compares your code to the code of other students and provides a match percentage of duplication. This is a common practice with schools that have large number of students taking Computer Science courses. In this scenario, it flagged the code of this and another student's as they were exactly the same. This resulted disciplinary action being given to the original writer of the code as he submitted his assignment after plagiarizer. However, the date and timestamps on GitHub, showed that he had wrote and committed the code before the plagiarizer had submitted his homework. I do not know how this situation ended. However, it could have been avoided by the original writer not posting his code online until after the assignment due date had passed. Personal Experience - MIS 320 In this class , we had an assignment that involved Javascript . Mind you, most of the class had never seen Javascript, let alone understood the syntax for it because we were taught Visual Basic throughout most of our collegiate career. That being said, a group of students spent one night in the computer lab trying to get the assignment completed. From what I recall, one person in the lab managed to figure out how to complete the assignment. Then shared it with the other students who were in the lab. They submitted the homework for grading. After the assignments were graded, the teacher made an announcement in class that a number of the assignments looked very similar (translation: looked plagiarized) and that if it happens again, he would be submitting the students' names to the Dean's Office for Academic Misconduct violations. Conviction of academic misconduct could suspension or expulsion. After that announcement, there were no more instances of that happening in that class. Personal Experience - CS 375 In this course , there was a similar incident to the above that took place. We had a homework assignment that was to be completed individually. One of the classmates, whom I also worked with at the university's IT department, was in the same class. The entire class managed to struggle with this assignment, so most turned in what they had working as we were told to turn in what we did have working and we would at least get some credit for the parts that did work. This student managed to get it fully working and shared it with some of the classmates that he sat near. That was big mistake as his code matched 2-3 other students in the class (the ones that he sat near or was friends with). The teacher immediately reported this Academic Misconduct to the dean's office in addition to making an announcement in class about the infraction and the action that had been taken. From what I recall, the student that provided the code was immediately suspended and lost his job (as he was a student employee, but no longer a student), and the other students that plagiarized the code were forced to drop the class (thus impacting their GPA and possibly delaying their graduation). In addition, all the students involved, have the Academic Misconduct on their collegiate records. Conclusion Putting your code online further validates that you have experience in the IT (Information Technology) industry. Furthermore, if perspective employers want to see your work, they can do so at their leisure. However, posting your code too soon, can result in your career path being altered in a way that you would least expect. I am not sure if my perspective employers looked at my GitHub repos when considering me for a job. However, I do provide this information to further backup my claim and discussions of my past programming and technology experience. Even putting code snippets online will help you out as they can be searched and used by yourself and others.

The only problem was that the customer had not received the chair. It was scheduled to be delivered on the same day that I was scheduled to assemble it, but that did not happen. I advised the customer to contact Customer Service and let them know of the issue. While the customer was waiting on hold, she asked me what did I do for a living. I told her that I assemble furniture and other handyman work part-time and work full-time in IT (Information Technology). Her eyes got real big and she asked if I could take a look at her printer once she got done with the call and I agreed. The Setup The customer had a laptop with Windows 10 and a HP Deskjet 2600 Series printer. This particular printer is designed to be connected to Wifi, but uses USB connection for the initial setup. She previously had another HP printer, but replaced it with the Deskjet 2600 one. She said that she had got it working at one point, but that it had stopped working and she was not sure why. Here are the various tasks that I did in order to get them working. I do not remember the exact order that they were done it, but I want to provide you with a checklist in case you run into the same issue. Reinstall Printer Drivers or Software First thing was to reinstall the printer drivers. The user already had the HP Printer Toolbox installed on the computer. It had the printer already configured in it like I previously mentioned. However, even a print test page would not print from the software. I performed the setup several times. The way that you have to set this printer up is to Install the HP software on your computer Connect the printer to the computer via USB cable Run the HP software setup configuration. This will ask you for the wireless settings to use and whether the device is on the network. Disconnect the USB cable Then the software will try to find the printer via the network. If it does not find it, then it will complain and ask that you try the setup again. This did not work for the probably 5 times that I tried it. Thus I figured I would check something else, which was the network itself. Assign A Static IP Address This printer connects to the network via Wifi. If you are familiar with how DHCP and the assigning of IP addresses work, then you can probably skip this section. For those of you that are not, continue reading. HP printers can print out a status sheet. This sheet includes everything from the IP address, software version, model number, ink or toner level and more. Often times, it prints all of this information on more than one sheet of paper (in this case printed 3 pages and was still going before I cancelled the print job). The customer had previously printed out one of the pages. On this print out, it had the IP address as 192.168.1.3. However, on the computer, one of the screens showed that it had the IP address mapped to 192.168.1.4. For those of you that are not familiar with IP addresses, this would be the equivalent of somebody giving you the address to a place, and everything in the address is correct but the house number. Thus resulting in you ending up at the wrong destination. Since the IP address changed between installation and usage, the computer was sending the print job to a device that was not on the network at the address specified (i.e. nobody was home). What I did was to go in the customer's router and assign the printer a static IP address. That way every time the printer connects to the network, it will always have the same IP address. Print A Test Page There are more than the two ways that you can print a test page. Below are the two ways that I tried to print something when diagnosing this issue. From Control Panel From the Control Panel, you can print a test page. Go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Right on the printer > Properties > Print Test Page. I tried this several times, but it would not print the test page. I checked the printer queue and it showed that the Test Page job was being sent and queued up, but it would error out and did not really give a reason or explanation about the error. From Word or Text Editor The alternative would be to type some text into an empty Word document and try to print it. This did not work either and errored out like the print from the Control Panel. Turn It Off and Back On \"Did you try turning it off and back on again?\" People that do not work in technology or understand it really underestimate how this simple step can correct a lot of tech or electronic problems. I had restarted the printer several times and it still was not getting the print jobs. I am not sure why this was the case. Then it came to mind to restart the computer. It was a Windows computer after all and most of the time when you install software on Windows, it is best to restart to make sure all the changes are applied as some software has to do stuff after the restart completes. Did the restart and after the Desktop appeared, the Word document I had attempted to print actually started printing. It was still in the print queue when I shut the computer down. Conclusion Did a few more prints just to confirm that all was still good and everything printed correctly as it should. I share this story about the printer issues in case you are having problems with yours. The biggest takeaway from this that I would recommend is that if you have a network printer, that setting it up to have a static IP address that is assigned by the router would eliminate this headache or printer connection issues in the future.","title":"HP Wireless Printer Problems"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.19-hp-wireless-printer-problems/#background","text":"I had a job for a chair assembly for a customer. The only problem was that the customer had not received the chair. It was scheduled to be delivered on the same day that I was scheduled to assemble it, but that did not happen. I advised the customer to contact Customer Service and let them know of the issue. While the customer was waiting on hold, she asked me what did I do for a living. I told her that I assemble furniture and other handyman work part-time and work full-time in IT (Information Technology).

She said that she had got it working at one point, but that it had stopped working and she was not sure why. Here are the various tasks that I did in order to get them working.

The user already had the HP Printer Toolbox installed on the computer. It had the printer already configured in it like I previously mentioned. However, even a print test page would not print from the software. I performed the setup several times. The way that you have to set this printer up is to Install the HP software on your computer Connect the printer to the computer via USB cable Run the HP software setup configuration. This will ask you for the wireless settings to use and whether the device is on the network. Disconnect the USB cable Then the software will try to find the printer via the network. If it does not find it, then it will complain and ask that you try the setup again. This did not work for the probably 5 times that I tried it.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the job downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well. 24-hour clock Bash Command echo \"<select>\" for h in {0..23}; do for m in {0..5}; do echo \"<option

realized that in my particular situation, that the values that were being returned from the database were in the 24-hour clock, but the documentation and mockups that we had for the screen that this time list was to be used on, was in the 12-hour clock. Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above. I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database. The rest of the command remained the same.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the job downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well.","title":"Background"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times/#24-hour-clock","text":"","title":"24-hour

However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database.

As you may know, Git was created by the same person that created Linux, Linus Torvalds. Thus it should be no suprise that the primary way of using Git is with the command line. When I started doing work that involved coding in C# (C-Sharp), that meant that I had to become familiar with Visual Studio. Mind you, I had not seriously used Visual Studio in several years. The last version I remember using was Visual Studio 2012. At the time of this writing, Visual Studio 2019 is the current version. In addition to the learning adjustment that I had to do for using the 2019 version of it, I also had to figure out how to use Git within Visual Studio. Let's just say that it was not that easy coming from years of working with command line. My particular work setup was not configured so that I can use Git Bash from the command line, terminal, or Package Manager Console within Visual Studio. Thus I have no way of manually running the commands that I am familiar with when it comes to Git and had to learn how to navigate a GUI version of Git. You Can Still See That? I was working with another developer on some code and mentioned that they could check out my branch to see what I had done. They asked whether to checkout the July branch or the August branch. Now I knew that I had deleted the July branch from the server and from my local repo, but was puzzled when they inquired. Afterwards, I double checked the server and sure enough it had been removed, yet they were still able to see it. Come to find out, when you do a sync of the origin (the server side) to your local in Visual Studio 2019, it does not remove the branches that no longer exist by default. Thus you end up with stale branches taking up space on your computer that probably have no use. There Is A Setting For That I did a bit of online research to see if something was wrong. Come to find out, there are many of posts and message board questions about how to address this. For Visual Studio 2019, there is a setting that has to be changed in order for it to remove the old branches that no longer exist on origin. By default, this setting is set to \"Unset\". This is similar to the equivalent of setting a boolean value to \"null\" (which should not and in some languages cannot be done). To change this setting, you will need to do the following. Open Visual Studio 2019 Go to the Team Explorer window Settings (via the home) Change the \"Prune remote branches during fetch\" option to True Save and close After you change this setting, each time that you do a fetch or sync, the branches that are no longer on the remote will be removed. In my opinion, I think that this needs to be the default behavior as it keeps your repository smaller and cleaner.","title":"Prune Branches In Visual Studio"},{"location":"technology/2020.09.12-prune-branch-in-visual-studio/#background","text":"Majority of my experience with Git has been via the command line.

Here are some ways that Github can be used a Content Management System (CMS). Little Tech Knowledge Required Once the website it set up on Github (most likely by a technical user), non-technical users can make the updates to the website from the Github website. Very little assistance would be needed as there is plenty of documentation on Github about how to update an existing repository and similar amount of documentation about how to do formatting with Markdown. No SSH or SFTP When updating some Content Management Systems or their plugins, you have to manually login to the server and upload the new files. Most non-technical users are not familiar with SSH or SFTP. Thus if they want to keep their website from being hacked or extending its functionality, then they would have to learn these things. This knowledge is not required if you want to add features to your website when hosted by Github. Depending on what you feature you are trying to implement, you can just login to the Github website, make the necessary updates, and commit the changes... all within the web browser. No Plugin or Module Updates or Vulnerabilities When you are not using Wordpress or Drupal, there are no plugins or modules to update. That means that you spend less time doing maintenance on your website and more time actually creating content and getting work done. Plugins or site updates are when the most hacking attempts take place. When it comes to Drupal, there was a security patch notice that was sent out to users that had subscribed to their update alerts. In a follow up announcement, Drupal mentioned that if you had not updated your website within 7 hours of the notice being sent, then consider your website hacked or compromised . That basically means that if you were not reading the email as soon as it was received and began performing the update, your website was probably compromised. Nobody is ever just waiting for an unannounced email to be received. One of my websites fell victim to a hacking attempt. I will admit, having backups of your database are helpful when those things occur. That the most recent backup did not have a number of recent changes, so it took more effort to restore the website as the bad data and files had to be removed from the server and the database cleaned up so that it would not reference them and throw errors. Leverage Github Actions Some of the features that you would normally have build into a website that is based on a Content Management System, such as sending out newsletters, can still be done through the use of Github Actions. While the implementation of some of these features may be more involved than installing a plugin on to a website, there is a great chance that you will not have to update them that often or at all once they are implemented. Spell Check Example For example, on this website, I have a spell check action enabled through Github Actions. It is configured that each time an update is pushed to Github, that the spell check is performed. If a misspelled word is found, then that update is not allowed to be deployed to production. Thus the mistakes that exist on your website are few to none. SSG (Static Site Generator) Most websites do not need to have the complexity of a social media, banking, or online learning website. This is especially true for those of you who have a website that is solely used as a blog. Thus why would you use a tool that is more complex than what is required for the job. That would be the equivalent of driving an 18-wheeler to pick up your 2 kids from school... doing way to much. Github allows you to build websites using Jekyll, which is one of many SSGs (Static Site Generator) that exist. This website uses MkDocs, a SSG that is made with Python. SSGs allow you to write your content in Markdown or HTML and through the use of templates, converts each file into a full HTML page. At the time of this writing, there are about 120 blog posts and another 15 pages on the site that have to be generated. This takes about 5 seconds per build run to generate all the HTML, CSS, and JS files that are used on the website. That's pretty quick if you need to make a site-wide color change or template change. Conclusion If you are using Drupal or Wordpress for your blog, consider switching to a static website that is generating with Github. There are many features that will make website updates easy that you can add on through the use of Github Actions.","title":"Github as Content Management System (CMS)"},{"location":"technology/2020.09.22-github-as-content-management-system/#background","text":"Some time ago, I wrote about me converting my website from a database-driven Content Management System (CMS) website to a static website that uses a Static Site Generator (SSG).

Plugins or site updates are when the most hacking attempts take place.

In a follow up announcement, Drupal mentioned that if you had not updated your website within 7 hours of the notice being sent, then consider your website hacked or compromised .

The channel already existed for some time, there was not many videos uploaded to the channel in past years and we were trying to increase the subscriber count. One of the ways to increase the subscriber count is to meet the best practices that YouTube recommends. One of those recommendations is to have a channel trailer. Get The Images Over the years, there have been a number of images uploaded to the Instagram account for the organization. Instagram makes it rather difficult for you to download the images that you have previously posted once you upload them. In order for me to get the content that had been previously uploaded, I had to go into the Settings and then request a download of the Instagram Data. Depending on the amount of content that you have previously uploaded, it may take some time for Instagram to provide you with the data. In this particular scenario, it took about 3 hours for me to receive the email notification that the download was ready. Once you have received the email notification, you have to go back to Instagram and it will present you with the option of downloading the data. The data download is provided as a zip file. As you see, there are a number of files. All of your captions, comments, and more are provided in the download. The part I am most interested in is the Photos folder. Inside of this folder, the photos are grouped by the year and month that they were posted. FFMPEG While I could have used another tool for this process, I wanted to figure out a fast way to do this. Thus it immediately came to mind to use ffmpeg to make the video from the photos. How did I come to this thought? When setting up automations with ffmpeg previously, I found out that it is a very powerful tool when it comes to outputting things as video. Just have to know what commands to use, or know what commands somebody else has used, to get it to do what you want it to do. Thus to get the images that I wanted into a video file, I created the below script. The Script #!/bin/bash # create a video slide show from a folder of images # information sourced from https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Slideshow ## remove existing files rm output.mp4 list.txt ## loop through the files and subfiles in the directory for filename in $(find . -name '*.jpg') do echo \"file '${filename}'\" >> list.txt echo duration 2 >> list.txt done ## run create the video file ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -vsync vfr -pix_fmt rgb24 output.mp4 Latest version of this script that I am using is available in my Ubuntu Automation repository . Script Breakdown I got some of the commands from the FFMPEG Documentation . Leveraging the documentation, also known as RTFM , can be helpful. First, the script removes the existing output.mp4 and list.txt files. The previous files are removed because ffmpeg will either prompt to overwrite or automatically exit, depending on the options you select, when it sees an output file that already exists. Next, it will loop through all the files that are in the directory or child directories looking for files that end with \".jpg\". If you have files in a different format, you can change the extension to match the files in your directory. Next, each image filename is added to list.txt and the duration that the picture should be displayed is added to the list.txt file between each image. One thing that I did note with this, is that the first image tends to stay up longer than the specified amount of seconds. In my scenario, the first image was displayed for about 3.5 seconds. Not sure why that is the case, but it was. Finally, after looping through all of the images, ffmpeg is called with various arguments to generate the video file from the images. Additional Editing I wanted to have some text overlays in the video, such as organization branding and social media information. Thus after the video had been rendered by ffmpeg, I used Kdenlive to add these additional elements to the video. Then that output was uploaded to the organization's YouTube channel as the channel trailer. If you would like to check out the final version of that video, then you can watch it on YouTube .","title":"FFMPEG for Image Slideshow"},{"location":"technology/2020.10.10-ffmpeg-for-image-slideshow/#background","text":"I needed to create a YouTube channel trailer for another channel that I manage for an organization.

Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. For example, most future engineers are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate future engineers about the impact that computers and computer programming has with society. This project targets the \"T, E, and M\" of \"STEM\" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions. Teach Software Versioning One of the goals of this project is to be able to teach the next generation of engineers about the programming, software versioning, and how valuable engineers and technologists are to society and the impact that they have. A game was developed to be combined with this project to teach about software versioning, how sometimes Software Developers don't get it right the first time, and the negative impact that can occur if they don't get it right the first time. Below is the image of a group of future engineers working their way to developing the psuedocode for a normal traffic cycle. As shown in the first version, all of the lights turned on but never turned off. In the final version, they figured out that they had to turn on and turn off each light as well as include a delay in between each light change. Video Demonstration Video demonstration of version 1.0 of the project is available to be watched at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_ZJNX0viM . This version of the demonstration of the traffic light working with an LCD screen connected. Parts List Below are the list of parts used for this project. You'll need to choose one of the mentioned options below depending on your budget. Using LEDs is cheaper than getting an actual traffic light. Raspiberry Pi 3 (May work on other models, but has only been tested on Raspberry Pi 3) Raspiberry Pi power supply Micro SD card (to run the OS and store project files) USB keyboard (mouse optional) HDMI display I2C 16x2 LCD Display Breadboard Jumper Cables Breadboard (optional) Python 2.7.9 (May work with later versions, but has only been tested with 2.7.9) Raspbian Jessie, Stretch, or Buster (May work on other OSs, but has only been tested with Raspbian Jessie) LED Option Red LED Yellow LED Green LED Real Traffic Light Option Relay board(s) with at least 3 channels Traffic Light Pin Setup Below is the mapping for the connections to the Raspberry Pi. The Pin numbers listed are the physical pin numbers on the board, not the GPIO pin numbers. If you are not using a relay board, the connections can be made directly to a breadboard with LEDs connected. Pi Pin (Board) GPIO Device Connection 2 -- LCD Display VCC (+5V) 3 -- LCD Display SDA 4 -- Relay Board VCC (+5V) 5 -- LCD Display SLC 19 11 Red Signal 21 9 Yellow Signal 23 10 Green Signal 30 -- LCD Display GND 34 -- Relay Board GND Visual of Pin Connections to Relay Board Demostrations and Video Discusssions These demostration videos show the traffic in one of several operating modes. Raspberry PI Traffic Light Controller Demonstration Discussing the Traffic Light Code Initial Setup Install Raspbian You will need to install Raspbian on your SD. Once you have completed this install, Then you can insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on. To install Raspbian using Ubuntu, I made a video tutorial which you can watch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1_MWWlkNI . Install Script In the scripts directory, run the install.sh script as root user. This will install of the required software and python packages. Update Apache Configuration Search for the file containing \"PrivateTmp=true\". This file should be in your /etc directory. Change this value to PrivateTmp=false . Then restart Apache. You may use cd /etc/ grep -R \"PrivateTmp=true\" * to search for the file that contains this value. Once grep returns the file name, edit the file and make the stated change. Running The Scripts To control the traffic light, run the raspitraffic.py script via command line. python raspitraffic.py Then visit the webpage to your TrafficPi in a web browser. A form will be presented with a list of programs to select from. Select the program you wish to run and click the \"Submit\" button. If a program is already running, the newly selected program will start once the end of the current program has been reached. If no program has been selected, the newly selected program will start immediately. Pseudocode Program The Pseudocode Program allows you to write your own program for controlling the traffic light. On the Control Panel webpage, enter each command that you want the light to perform on a line by itself in the \"Pseudocode Commands\" textbox. The list of commands are listed on the Control Panel webpage below the textbox. Move and Run Code on the Pi Software to Install on Pi Run these commands to install the necessary software on the Pi. You only need to do them once. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install curl libunwind8 gettext apt-transport-https Publish Your App Then run the publish command on your app dotnet publish -r linux-arm Copy the Files Then copy the files from your computer to the Pi. I used SSH for this. scp -pr bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/linux-arm/publish/* pi@trafficpi://home/pi/rpidotnet Run App On Pi Run the program by calling the executable. This filename will be the name of your project. ./rpidotnet Troubleshooting If your app does not run, make sure that execute permissions have been set for all roles (755).
