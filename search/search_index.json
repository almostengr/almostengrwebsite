A few modules exist which more or less successfully attempt to get Drupal to display meaningful breadcrumbs on every page. One of these modules is menu_breadcrumb , which displays the breadcrumb trail based on current node's menu path. Very useful and sufficient in most use cases. Limitations and automatic menu modules The only problem with menu_breadcrumb is when you're not happy to grant users the administer menu permission to create and assign menu items for the content they create. Several Drupal modules exist which work around the permission restriction and automatically create menu items for newly created content nodes. To name a few, Auto Menu and Automatic Menu , both of which are either only available for Drupal 5.x, or their Drupal 6.x implementation is still in beta development stage. Rules and Drupal API Fortunately, a quick and easy way to create menu items programmatically doesn't even require a standalone module. All we're going to need is the Rules module and a bit of Drupal API knowledge. The Rules set of modules allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions, such as arbitrary PHP code execution, based on occurring events, such as node creation. For the Drupal API part, we'll use a single function menu_link_save . menu_link_save requires an item configuration parameter, whose key names mirror the column names of Drupal's menu_links database table. The solution As mentioned above, we're going to use the Rules module. It's installation is pretty straightforward and requires no additional configuration. Let's move right to the setting up our rule. Say we want to create a menu item under Primary Links menu's Blog item every time a new node of type Story is created. Navigate your browser to Administer \u00bb Rules \u00bb Triggered rules page, add a new rule and configure it along the lines of the image: Finally, we're getting to the PHP snippet itself, which we'll use to automatically create a new menu item every time this rule is triggered.

Other examples for using this command are as follows: for x in $(ls -1 | grep 2016 | awk '{print $9}') do echo $x rm $x done This will remove all the files that have \"2016\" in the file name, year, or file size. for x in $(ls -1 *hello* | awk '{print $9}') do echo $x rm $x done This will remove all the files that have \"hello\" in the file name.","title":"Linux rm Argument list too long"},{"location":"blog/2018.01.14-farmos-nws-2.0/","text":"FarmOS NWS 2.0 The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service (NWS) to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

Bought it online and installed it myself within a weekend. The kit that I purchased came with the MyQ Internet gateway. You can watch my video review about the opener on YouTube . The Pros It is very quiet. If I open the door while standing on the other side of the house, I barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving. The opener was very easy to install. If you already have a garage door installed, adding this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall. The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there. This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if I chose to change my mind in the future. It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers. In my garage, I have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch. The Cons Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on. I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem. If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home. For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this. I did check the MyQ message board and saw that others have complained about this and a Liftmaster representative responded. However Liftmaster hasn't provide an update to this defect. The MyQ app doesn't always close the door back immediately after it has opened. With my android phone, if I press the button on my phone to close the door within 20 seconds of it being opened, the door doesn't close. However if I force close the app, reopen it, and then press the button to close the door, the door proceeds to close. This is another complaint that i have seen on the MyQ message board. Conclusion Overall it is a great garage door opener in my opinion. However it does have room for improvement, especially in regards to the app.","title":"1 Year Review of Liftmaster 8500 with MyQ Internet Gateway"},{"location":"blog/2018.01.20-1-year-review-of-liftmaster-8500-with-myq-internet-gateway/#the-pros","text":"It is very quiet.

Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are utilized during a flush. It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it was good that it was caught at this point. Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom. Video If you have comments or questions about the video, please leave them on the video's YouTube page. Video Transcript IF YOUR TOILET LEAPS LIKE THIS ON THE SIDE WHILE YOU'RE FLUSHING THE TOILET YOU PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE THE GASKET I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP HOW TO REPLACE THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLTS I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION LISTED ON THE PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK THE WATER UP STEP 3 DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT STEP 5 REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE THE OLD GASKET IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO IT BEING STRETCHED AND BEING IN USE FOR A WHILE THE NEW GAS THAT IS SMALLER BUT SHOULD FIT AS IT IS MADE OUT OF RUBBER STEP 6 INSTALL THE NEW GASKET THE NEW GASKET GOES OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND YOU MAY HAVE TO STRETCH IT TO FIT AS I DID IN MY CASE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO STRETCH IT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASILY AS IT IS A RUBBER GASKET ONCE YOU GET IT ON MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN IN AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO SPACE OR ROOM FOR LEAKAGE STEP 7 CLEAN THE MOUNTING POINTS AS YOU SEE THE MOUNTING POINTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BOLT ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET IS VERY DIRTY AND EVEN WITH SOME BLACK CORROSION BE SURE TO CLEAN THESE OFF AS YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CLEAN SO THAT IT MAKES A GREAT SEAL WHEN WHEN CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER IF YOU LEAVE ANY DIRT BEHIND IT MAY NOT CONNECT AS WELL AND YOU STILL MAY END UP HAVING A LEAK AFTER YOU GET DONE STEP 8 INSTALL THE NEW BOLTS SO BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE BOLT AND PUT IN THE RUBBER WASHER AND YOU PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOLT HEAD AND THEN LAYING THE TANK DOWN YOU'LL SIT THE BOLT THROUGH THE BOLT HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL AND THERE'S TWO OF THESE SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS PROCESS TWICE ONE FOR THE LEFT ONE FOR THE RIGHT THEN IF YOU NEED TO YOU CAN ADD THE WASHER AND THE NUT ON THE BOTTOM ON THE PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAVE IT STATED THAT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONFIGURATION OF HOW THE TOILET IS BUILT SINCE MY TOILET PREVIOUSLY HAD A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION I DECIDED TO INSTALL A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION STEP 9 INSTALL THE TANK SO TAKE THE TANK MAKE SURE YOU LINE THE BOLT HOLES UP AND LAY IT ON THE OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE TOILET FLANGE YOU MAY WANT TO ROCK IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ACTUALLY SEALS IN VERY WELL STEP 10 INSTALL WASHERS AND NUTS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL WASHERS AND NUTS THAT GO UNDER THE TANK ITSELF THAT CONNECT THE TANK TO THE ACTUAL PART OF THE BOWL IN THE REAR YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THESE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER WITH A RUBBER WASHER ON TOP A METAL WASHER NEXT TO THAT AND THEN FINALLY THE NUT AT THE END BE SURE TONIGHT OVER-TIGHTEN BEAT THE NUT AT THE END BECAUSE IF YOU OVER TIGHTEN IT YOU CAN CORRECT A CERAMIC ON THE TOILET AND IF YOU PRACTICE CERAMIC OF THE TOILET YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER TOILET IT IS PREFERRED THAT YOU DO A HAND TIGHTEN ONLY AS YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED AND CAN STOP APPLYING PRESSURE BEFORE THE CERAMIC CRACKS STEP 11 RECONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE SO AS YOU DID THE DISCONNECT OF THE SUPPLY LINE YOU BASICALLY UNDO WHAT YOU PROVEN IS DONE SO REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP 12 TURN ON THE WATER I RECOMMEND TURNING ON THE WATER MAYBE A HALF TO ONE TURN AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE NO LEAKS OR YOU DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TURNING FURTHER IF YOU TURN IT ALL THE WAY ON AND IT STARTS LEAKING THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ALL THE WAY BACK OFF THEREFORE YOU CREASE THE CHANCES OF GETTING WATER ON YOUR FLOOR AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT IS NOT WANTED STEP 13 FLUSH AND CHECK THE LEAKS ONCE YOU VERIFY THAT THERE IS NO MORE LEAKS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL ALSO IF YOU LIKE INSTANT NOTIFICATIONS

Currently I build automations using Selenium WebDriver and Sikuli to automate routine daily tasks. Since I maintain multiple websites, I figured that I could use this same technology to perform the code updates on the websites that I manage. Selenium WebDriver has some first time setup steps that have to be done in order for you to be able to build the automations. My browser of choice is Firefox. Some people reading this will not be thrilled about that, but everyone has their preferences. If you like to use Chrome, or worse Internet Explorer, then the steps mentioned below are similar to those for Firefox. However this post focuses on setting up with Firefox. First thing that you will need to do is to have Eclipse or similar IDE installed on your computer. That will not be covered in this post. Next, download the Gecko Driver. That can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver . The Gecko Driver serves as a middle man between WebDriver and the web browser. The web browser cannot directly communicate or interact with the web browser. What happens is WebDriver interacts with the Gecko Driver. Then the Gecko Driver translates those interactions into actions that the browser can perform. Once the action is performed, then response is sent back from the browser to the Gecko Driver to WebDriver. Next, create a Maven project. In the pom.xml file, you will need to add the following dependency to the file: <dependency> <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId> <version>3.14.0</version> </dependency> At the time of this writing, 3.14.0 version, was the second latest versoin that was available. I would recommend using the latest or later version that is available. Next, add the Java code below to your main function. This is the simpliest code to get an automation running with Firefox. System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); // define geckodriver location WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); // open the website of choice Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser ``` In the above, /home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver will need to be replaced with the location that you have downloaded the Gecko Driver. If you choose, you may also change the website that the browser opens. Now you may run the application that you have built. If done correctly, you will see the browser open, then the Google home page appear, then the browser close. There may be some red text in the Java console, but there is no need to be alarmed by this unless there is an exception mentioned. The code used here can be downloaded from my Github repository at https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial The entire file Java file would look like the following: package com.thealmostengineer.seleniumtutorial; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver; /** * Simple webdriver * */ public class App { static void geckoDriverTest() throws Exception { System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.manage().window().maximize(); // maximize the browser window driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser } public static void main( String[] args ) { try { geckoDriverTest(); } catch (Exception e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } }","title":"Set up Gecko Driver on Ubuntu"},{"location":"blog/2019.04.05-set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu/#set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu","text":"Selenium WebDriver can be used to automate routine tasks and to perform regression tests.

The doors will respond to the correspond to the button being pressed and the message will disappear within a couple of seconds. This is a temporary work around.

Drupal does have a module that will do just that. However the process to schedule a post was badly designed in my opinion. That being said, I decided to write my own module that would handle this functionality for me. By writing my own module, I can customize the module how I choose without having additional features that I do not need. In case you are wondering whether this works or not, I am using the code below to publish the blog posts on this website. First you'll need to create a content type if you don't already have one. With Drupal 7, go to Structure > Content Types to create a new content type. When creating the content type, take note to the Machine Name that is associated with your content type. You'll need this later. Next let's take a look at the code: function almostengr_publish_posts() { $result = db_query(\"select nid from {node} where created &lt;= :datetime and promote = :promote and status = :status and type = :type\", array(\":datetime\" =&gt; REQUEST_TIME, \":promote\" =&gt; 1, \":status\" =&gt; 0, \":type\" =&gt; \"article\")); foreach($result as $row) { $article = node_load($row-&gt;nid); $article-&gt;status = 1; // update the status $article-&gt;comment = 2; // enable comments node_save($article); // save article } // end foreach } // end function The code above queries the node table for the node IDs that have a created date before the current date and time, are selected to be promoted to the front page, are not published, and have a type of article. Then each node that matches the queried condition, will be loaded, have the node status updated to published and the comments enabled, and then saved. Next need to create a cron process that will handle this further. We will do this in code too. function almostengr_cron() { almostengr_publish_posts(); } // end function With the code above, we are using cron to call the publish posts function. The cron function within the module that you create will be automatically called via the Drupal hook_cron functionality. Now to the creating of content. When you create a new node, you need to do the following for it to be scheduled to be published: Set the Created Date to the date and time that you wish the article to be published Promoted to Front Page selected Published status is not selected Save the content That's it.

Video Video Transcript Thanks for checking out this video. I'm going to show you how to go around and identify the outlets and the lights and which breaker they are connected to in your breaker panel. Thanks for tuning in. if you have not already please subscribe down in the button below. so when you go to do electrical work i.e. if you're changing out a light switch if a plug has an issue and you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to. in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself. the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the ones that are odd numbered starting with the top down you have one event all the way down to the harbor mini Breakers that you have on that particular side so on my outside the breaker number highest ranking number is 25 so I will stop at 25 and then I will start with the even numbers of 2 4 and 6 and I was like that and then use autocomplete to and at 26 which is the highest number that I have on the right hand side so the first record that I have in the number one position is the bath Outlet as well as the exterior Outlets saw internet in and then I will also include the amperage which is 28 and then I will go to the next one which is not connected so I'll just know that is not connected and then I will put in the next two are the air conditioner compressor or connected to the air conditioner compressor and then I will continue this process and then once I get all the way filled in down to 25 and print this out I will actually cut this between Rose 14 and 15 and I will actually add another header here on row 15 so insert an entire row and then copy this header here so that and I can add as actually had another roll so that I have some spacing in between so when I do go to cut this I don't have to be very exact with my cut and sew cut this between here and then so I have the even breakers on one side and then excuse me. Breakers on one side and then he even bring his on the other side now if you have a panel where the door opens sideways you could actually move emails over so that they are side-by-side like this and that way you can better see and then you only have to use one shut up a paper printout to do this however since my breaker panel actually opens up instead of to the left or to the right and going to do this way and split it sideways so I can put them side-by-side on next to space in between the edge of the breaker in the edge of the panel in the breaker itself so for the sales that are really long like this one and these here but I'm actually going to do is through this entire column and set it to do word wrap in LibreOffice calc need to go to text and a text under the format menu and then you can resize a column into text Will resize accordingly and so I'm going to actually shorten breaker number to this breaker and that way it'll allow me to use this room here I can you guys leave an abbreviated if you want to use for space and so I do have one breaker here that is a arc fault or ground-fault breaker breaker actually labeled in the end column that it isn't scription of that is our Breakers to clearly distinguish some reason this sale did not wrap correctly so you may have simply of formatting issues that come up like this and just have to go in and double check on them and if worst case we align the row to get it to do right to be here now is doing correctly are you in some places use the abbreviations to try to help with the wrapping so for instance here instead of spelling kitchen out I just took out all of the files that were in the word kitchen until you get something here that resembles the kitchen counter so counter counter I took out all the vowels yet again so you have cnpr you can kind of figure that out just no reasoning and same thing here with front how do you say it's not fully showing a hold of wrapping correctly so the same thing here with fry and so I will also do the headings on this one and make those bold you know that goes are there and then if you want to you can actually make these rolls alternate Colors video but it's pretty straightforward you know how to adjust the Lights theme background color of a particular role so that I can clearly read all the way across which role you know which item is so if I'm looking for the dryer and I can't cross here and say okay will dryer is 30 amps I can locate fryer bicep on the amperage or I can locate it based upon the position and once you have completed this be sure to save a copy of this in the reason I say that is cuz in the future if you happen to add breaker Outlets name something that say you add an outlet in a new room or you add an additional light in the new room then you know you can go here instead of retyping this all the way over you just make that necessary addition and then free printed back out and stick it back in your breaker box I'm out stop attic grid lines instead of using beat coloring technique will be far easier to read his follow your line finger across the line of the dates and that way you know somebody comes along in the future they won't have to guess when this was last updated though clearly so they know if anything has changed between this date and the current date of whenever they're looking at it then they can reprint this out and put a updated label inside a breaker box so as you see I've completed the printout of the stuff that I was going to do on the computer with the labeling then I've covered it in mailing tape as my breaker panel is outside hopefully this will protect it against the weather and any other elements that may come in contact with the labels I have a copy of this saved on my computer so I can go in and print out additional labels in the future if needed if I need to make any adjustments I can make those adjustments on the print out and then print them back out again this process has helped you in identifying and labeling your breaker panel if you have any questions or comments please leave those in the comments section below if this video has helped you please give this video a thumbs up.","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel/#identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel","text":"","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel/#summary","text":"This video describes how I went about identifying the breakers in my breaker panel.

Sometimes having an app does help you out to be more productive. Other times, it is a waste of space and a way for the company to spy on you and your activities so that they can target you with ads. That being said, here are seven reasons why I am hesitant to install new apps. Reason One: Mobile Friendly Website It is no secret that majority of the online traffic today comes from some sort of mobile device. As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websites identified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders. Which brings me to my next reason... Reason Two: Less Notifications Today's society is constantly connected. Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level. Reason Three: Phone Space Apps take up space. Some take up more than others. At last check, the Facebook app is over 150MB. Compare that to other apps, and that is a large application. To add to that, apps store data on your phone. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will cache some of the data on your phone that they have downloaded in the background. Over time, this cached data, if not removed, will slow down your phone and reduce your battery life. Meanwhile, I could be using that phone space to store videos, photos, music, audio books... you get the idea. Reason Four: It May Be Old, But It Still Works When you do not rely on the app to be able to interact with a website or service, you can use an older phone. Periodically, Android raises the minimum version that apps have to comply with. Some app developers, mandate that you have an operating system that is no more than 3 versions behind the latest stable version available. About a year ago, I encountered this with the Southwest app. I have Android Lollipop on my phone. In an update, Southwest made the minimum version to Android Marshmallow, thus not allowing me to have the app on my phone. Southwest mobile website does everything that the app does, including displaying my boarding pass, so I started using that and uninstalled the app. Yes\u2026 I know that I could have went and got a new phone so that I could have continued to use the app. No\u2026 I could not justify the cost of getting a new phone for convenience of being able to check-in on a flight about 2 to 3 times per year. Besides if I had issues with the mobile website, Southwest lets you print boarding passes for free. Reason Five: IOS Versus Android Appearance and Features If you are an Android person asking an iPhone user how to do something in an app, there is a 50/50 chance that the directions given will not work. Same goes for the other way around. Why is that? Well iPhone apps have to follow Apple standards in order to be listed in the App Store. Android apps do not have similar standards. In addition, some apps are built upon the features that are native to that operating system. Therefore, if one system interprets \"and\" as \"&\" and the other interprets it as \"+\", then you will get two different outcomes for the same thing. This problem is not as big now as it was in the past thanks to programming languages such as Xamarin, which allow for code to be written once and be compatible for iOS and Android platforms. Reason Six: Information Apps Are A Waste In the past, I've done consultations for small businesses and startups and they claim that one of main things that they want to do as part of getting their business off the ground is to create an app. Some do have their preferences about getting aniOS app built before the Android app and vice versa, but that is not the point of this reason. When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this: KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do? CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services. KENNY: Anything else beyond that? CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app. KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app created is x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars. CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find. Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download an app because they want information about your business. That is what your website is for. People download apps because they want additional features that are not available via your website or to enhance the functionality of their phone. For instance, some people, myself included, have multiple email accounts. I would not download an email app that only supported one email account. While it is true that I could have all of my email forwarded to a single account, I have multiple accounts because each account has a designated purpose. I do not want my \"daily coupon and specials\" emails be merged in with my \"new billing statement available\" emails. Reason Seven: The App Is A Fancy Web Browser Try this... go to your app and take a note of its appearance. Then go to the website (or mobile website) that is associated with that app. If the app and the mobile website look the same, there is a 99.999999994% (yes that last 4 is significant) chance that the app that you have is just a web browser that only allows you to access that company's website. That's right... there are companies that are building mobile friendly websites and then building apps that only navigate to that mobile friendly website. I am not going to mention their names, but some financial institutions that I have done business with have done this in the past. In addition, I did some contract work for a service provider. That service provider was charging about $1,000 for the mobile app. All they were doing were changing the default URL in the app, installing a WordPress plugin so that the page would render as being mobile friendly, and publishing it to the App or Play Store. All of that took about a 1 hour to complete. Conclusion While these strategies may not work for you, I find my phone to be less of a maintenance annoyance and pain point for keeping updated since I am using fewer apps.

Sometimes having an app does help you out to be more productive. Other times, it is a waste of space and a way for the company to spy on you and your activities so that they can target you with ads. That being said, here are seven reasons why I am hesitant to install new apps.","title":"7 Reasons I Can Do That Without The App"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-one-mobile-friendly-website","text":"It is no secret that majority of the online traffic today comes from some sort of mobile device. As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websites identified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders. Which brings me to my next reason...","title":"Reason One: Mobile Friendly Website"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-two-less-notifications","text":"Today's society is constantly connected. Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level.","title":"Reason Two: Less Notifications"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-three-phone-space","text":"Apps take up space. Some take up more than others. At last check, the Facebook app is over 150MB. Compare that to other apps, and that is a large application. To add to that, apps store data on your phone. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will cache some of the data on your phone that they have downloaded in the background. Over time, this cached data, if not removed, will slow down your phone and reduce your battery life. Meanwhile, I could be using that phone space to store videos, photos, music, audio books... you get the idea.","title":"Reason Three: Phone Space"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-four-it-may-be-old-but-it-still-works","text":"When you do not rely on the app to be able to interact with a website or service, you can use an older phone.

About a year ago, I encountered this with the Southwest app. I have Android Lollipop on my phone. In an update, Southwest made the minimum version to Android Marshmallow, thus not allowing me to have the app on my phone. Southwest mobile website does everything that the app does, including displaying my boarding pass, so I started using that and uninstalled the app. Yes\u2026 I know that I could have went and got a new phone so that I could have continued to use the app. No\u2026 I could not justify the cost of getting a new phone for convenience of being able to check-in on a flight about 2 to 3 times per year.

Same goes for the other way around. Why is that? Well iPhone apps have to follow Apple standards in order to be listed in the App Store. Android apps do not have similar standards. In addition, some apps are built upon the features that are native to that operating system. Therefore, if one system interprets \"and\" as \"&\" and the other interprets it as \"+\", then you will get two different outcomes for the same thing. This problem is not as big now as it was in the past thanks to programming languages such as Xamarin, which allow for code to be written once and be compatible for iOS and Android platforms.","title":"Reason Five: IOS Versus Android Appearance and Features"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-six-information-apps-are-a-waste","text":"In the past, I've done consultations for small businesses and startups and they claim that one of main things that they want to do as part of getting their business off the ground is to create an app. Some do have their preferences about getting aniOS app built before the Android app and vice versa, but that is not the point of this reason. When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this: KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do? CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services. KENNY: Anything else beyond that? CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app. KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app created is x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars. CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find. Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download an app because they want information about your business. That is what your website is for. People download apps because they want additional features that are not available via your website or to enhance the functionality of their phone. For instance, some people, myself included, have multiple email accounts. I would not download an email app that only supported one email account. While it is true that I could have all of my email forwarded to a single account, I have multiple accounts because each account has a designated purpose. I do not want my \"daily coupon and specials\" emails be merged in with my \"new billing statement available\" emails.","title":"Reason Six: Information Apps Are A Waste"},{"location":"blog/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-seven-the-app-is-a-fancy-web-browser","text":"Try this... go to your app and take a note of its appearance.

One of the things that I have done is to start writing more blog posts and documents in Markdown instead of using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. Reason 1: Converts to Other Platforms Markdown is used by several other platforms. One of the most noted platforms that uses Markdown is Github Pages. When using WYSIWYG, it allows you to make well formatted documents using a plain text editor, but allows you to convert them to another editor so that it looks like you typed them in a word processor (like MS Word). Why is this useful? Reason 2: Allows You To Type Faster For me, markdown allows me to type faster. I'm able to type two asterisks (**) faster than I am able to shift my hands to be able to process Ctrl+B for bolding text. In addition, you do not have to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse to click the corresponding icon for the text modification that you are trying to perform. Reason 3: No Need For WYSIWYG Many bloggers use WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors when writing their content on their website. The problem those editors, is that they add a bunch of extra HTML formatting such as paragraph, span, and div tags. Some add special characters in their paragraphs as a way to make those formatting changes. Then if you change the appearance of the website, the content of the page also changes. In the worst case, it changes uncontrollably because of the new styling (CSS) that you have in place. By using markdown, the extra formatting is not added in the field of the post.

What Kind of Pest (The Problem) Squirrels and rats both chew on wood. However they do not eat the same stuff, so you have to be selective with the bait that you choose. For most of the automations that I build, I use Selenium WebDriver as the automations are for web-based applications. Recently, we have noticed that number of automations have not been running due to \u201cconnection refused\u201d exceptions. The connection is being refused from the automation jar not connecting to the Gecko Driver (the interface between WebDriver automation and the browser). Applying knowledge that I have of computers, normally you only see \u201cconnection refused\u201d messages when one or more of the scenarios occur too many devices trying to connect at the same time, also referred to as Denial of Service Attack or Distributed Denial of Service Attack a firewall is rejecting the connection wrong password when trying to authenticate.

In other words, we know it is not a rat based on the evidence. Therefore, through the process of elimination, it must be a squirrel. Majority being that out of 7 days of the week that it was used, it would fail only on 1 of those days. I then did some research on the internet that provided a number of causes and solutions for the exception occurring. Some of the causes included the Gecko Driver process not being able to write to a log file because existing log file already exists (not in our case) having concurrent WebDriver automations running at the same time (which wasn\u2019t our case as we have done several at the same time in the past) to the hosts file not having the localhost IP address entered (which we did not, but nslookup and ping commands both returned valid IP addresses) having bad code. I got to that last reason in the list, bad code, and I put more effort into looking into the code as we have experienced (2+ years) and inexperienced developers on our team. Found The Nest (Found The Source Of The Problem) After search through multiple automation projects, shaking my head at some of the exact examples of bad code mentioned in Robert Martin\u2019s Clean Code , I hit the bullseye. Several of the automations had the same code. Yes\u2026 copied and pasted. First person got it working, so the next person got theirs working by doing exactly what the first person did. There's that saying about if you see one bug, there's probably another one not too far way. This would be it. To make it worse, it was multiplying everytime the code was copy and pasted. This is what I found: WebDriver driver = null; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here driver.quit(); System.exit(0); } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); System.exit(1); } Now this is just a snippet of the actual code. Obviously, I cannot put the entire code here because of confidentiality. Do you notice the problem with this code? The problem here is that if an exception occurs between the try and driver.quit(); , the browser and as a result, the Gecko Driver process never exits. What happens when you have too many processes running? The system will hang. What happens when there are too many connections open to a process? Some of those connections are refused. Spraying The Bug Spray (The Solution) To now rid the varmint of our code, I had to fix the defect that I identified. The driver.quit(); should always be executed regardless of whether the exception occurs. The reason being is that you do not want to the browser nor the Gecko Driver process running as they will hang up your system or result in the \"connection refused\" exceptions. So I changed the above code to the code below: WebDriver driver = null; int exitCode = 1; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here exitCode = 0; } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); } driver.quit(); System.exit(exitCode); The changes that I made: the driver.quit(); has been moved outside of the try-catch block. That way it will always execute whether an exception occurs or not. Could a finally block been used? Yes. However, for the sake of simplifying the code I did not use one. I moved the System.exit call to the end of the code. It is best to have only one way to exit a function. If you have multiple ways to exit (or return) out of a function, code that needs to exit may not get executed because of the multiple ways out. I created a new integer variable called exitCode . Following standards for program exit code, 1 or greater means that something went wrong during execution. 0 means that everything went well during execution. Therefore, the variable defaults to 1 because you do not want your code to say that all went well when it actually did not. It is better to have a false failure and it get noticed than to have a false success and it go undetected. Conclusion If you are going to copy the code of others, please be sure to review it first before using it as it may have defects already in it. If you do not know what the code does, then spend a few moments searching for those commands or snippets online so that you learn what they do. Using code somebody else wrote without confirming that it is not defective, is like building a chair from wood and not checking to see if it is rotting or has termites. \"Rotting.\" by AisforAmy91 is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0","title":"Copying Infested Code"},{"location":"blog/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#copying-infested-code","text":"","title":"Copying Infested Code"},{"location":"blog/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#background","text":"As some of you may know, my current role consists of me building and maintaining automations.

Video Video Transcript what's going on YouTube family so in this video I'm gonna actually to set up the automatic updates using unattended upgrades on Ubuntu 18.04 so let's get to it thanks for checking out the almost engineer channel if you are visiting for the first time please be sure to subscribe by clicking subscribe button below so automatic updates is a feature available in Ubuntu similar to Windows has Windows updates where it basically up stations the system automatically with little to no effort on your part and so the default setup for automatic updates is that it only updates these security packages however I actually wanted to get it to update everything on the system and so what I'm gonna do is actually run through a number of steps and these steps are available on my website as well as the Ubuntu - Help section of the Ubuntu - website on how to configure some of this so the first thing you'll need to do is to run sudo apt-get install unattended upgrades and I already have that installed it's pretty common I think it's installed by default when you install Ubuntu 18.04 so if you don't have it just run the install command it won't hurt if you already have it it'll tell you you already have it alright so the next thing you go to CD Etsy apt apt Kampf daddy alright and then in this directory there are two files that we're going to edit so the first one is going to be the 50 unattended upgrades and then the next one is going to be the 20 auto upgrades so you're gonna need to sudo for this so 50 unattended upgrades looks like I have a whole backup file I'll probably come back and remove that point so alright do VI and as you see here so there are comments in this file and so basically by defaults like I mentioned it will only install security updates but I want to actually install like general updates as well so I'm going to remove the double slashes here and then do WQ actually gonna go out and open nano you can still do this in VI but nano I'm more familiar with the shortcuts for nano so alright so we've removed the comments for the just standard updates I don't want the proposed or backports consultant unnecessarily stable updates so you only want the stuff that's actually stable so going down if you there are packages that you want to exclude you can uncomment these usually I would leave these as are as they are because you never know when update may happen for those you want the latest version the next option mentions whether you want the development release of Ubuntu to be automated oh great I'm going to leave that at false I want to make sure that I have the latest stable version not the development version so again I'm leaving that one at false all right the next option says that it allows you to control if on an unclean dpkg exit understand the upgrades will automatically run the default is true to ensure that your updates keep getting installed so I will leave that at true so I'll relieve this since this mine is coming it I'll leave that as is alright split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that they can be interrupted with sig term this makes the upgrade a bit slower it has to benefit that shut down while the upgrade is running is possible I'm gonna leave that at false again it's not necessarily but if you need to have that done you can uncomment this and go forward the next option install all unintended upgrades when the machine is shutting down instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running this will obviously make shutdown slower I'm going to leave that commented because I don't when I shut down a system I wanted to go ahead and shut down I don't want it to continue to go ahead and try to install the updates while shutting down all right the next option is to send the email to this address for problems or packages upgrade so basically if there's a problem you'll get an email which also means you also need to have a mail server setup and so since I do development on this particular machine I don't want to setup a mail server to prevent some of those development actions from sending out emails because sometimes you know when you're developing you build our email functionality and the last thing you want is to have a email going out to a actual human user you know in your development face all right so removed used kernels you'll want to let's see I want to uncomment this one and the reason I'm I'm coming this one is uncomment and gonna set this to true and the reason I'm doing that is because of the fact I want the kernel packages removed if you don't remove kernel packages what will happen over time is that the disk space will eventually started getting used up significantly because kernel packages are relatively big on a Linux system and so I went through one day and I actually had about 15 or 20 gigs of packages just sitting that were no longer the latest version so it's like if it's not the latest version why do I still have it and so I removed it so this will handle that automatically so you don't have to manually do it alright the next one do automatic removal of new unused dependency after the upgrade so which is the equivalent of running app get out of remove I do want that and I'm going to uncomment it and then also set it to the true automatically reboot without confirmation and so basically if it finds the reboot file then you wanted to reboot I am leave that one set at false well actually I take that back I'm actually changed this to true because the system does need to reboot I wanted to go ahead and reboot to apply those changes and then the next option I wanted to reboot to am is pretty decent for my particular situation you know at 2:00 a.m. I'm usually not doing anything there may be a chance where a automation of some sort is running in the background not on this particular machine but just in general so this should be sufficient in my opinion all right if you want to set a bandwidth limit you can uncheck this setting frankly I do not care about the bandwidth limit so I believe that as is if you want logging you can set that up I'm gonna leave it as false same thing for the syslog facility download operates only on AC power this particular machine only runs off of AC power there is no battery connected to it so no sense of setting it up because it will always need to be run and then last option is to download and install it grace only on non meter connections I believe that one commented if you're using like a Wi-Fi hotspot or something of that similar nature you'll want to consider enabling this option that way you're not installing you know updates in using all of your allocated bandwidth all right so I'm going to save that file now and the next file I will need to look at is also in the same directory it is the 2002 upgrades so open nano again if you want to use VI you can use VI but I'm using nano alright and so per the documentation on the Ubuntu website it mentions that there are a number of options that we can add in here and so update package lists that the one is already added and recommended to be done also the same thing for the unattended upgrade value set to one alright so the additional options are to add apt periodic and then Auto clean interval and set that a value to seven and so what this will do is it will clean up old download archives every week so again that's about the maintaining the space on the file system keeping it clean and then download upgradable packages is the other option that it mentions that is advisable to be included so you do a periodic download - upgradable packages and set that by you equal to one with a semicolon and then that is it for that one alright oops save then exit alright so once you have done that if you are using like version control for your SC directory you'll want to commit those changes so I'm going to go ahead and do that now at - ooh sudo get status just to confirm that those are added and sudo get commit and then we're going to do updated the unattended upgrade settings actually I need to change that to updated so go back alright and then for safekeeping I need to push that up alright so my commit has been pushed up so that this configuration change has now been saved and if something happens to this system in the future all I have to do is pull that configuration back down and it is good to go so hopefully this video has helped you in configuring your unattended upgrade set up on your Ubuntu to 18.04 machine if you have any questions

However, like any piece of software, it has to be regularly worked on in order to stay up to date. Thus I looked into switching over to a static website. Static websites are now starting to make a comeback. As you may know, the early dates of websites were mostly comprised of static websites. Over time, then need for information to be delivered faster, items to be purchased online, and individuals wanting to have their own online space, resulted in more dynamic tools being created. Here are the pros and cons that I discovered when researching to switch to a static website. The Pros No Database A static website does not have a need for a database. When you have less infrastructure to maintain, you are free to do other things. With Drupal, if your database goes down, becomes corrupt, or gets hacked, your website will have reduced or no functionality. In addition, you have to keep regular backups of your database in case something does happen to it. I had one of the Drupal websites that I maintain get hacked once. It took a lot of effort to clean up the database after the successful hacking attempt. In addition, the most recent backup, was approximately 6 months or more old. So the changes had taken place since then, which were not tracked, would have been lost and probably not restored. Drupal Security Updates Drupal releases security and feature updates regularly. When the updates are released, they are included in the weekly email newsletter that goes out. In one occurrence, the weekly newsletter went out and a Drupal-based website was exploited within hours based on the details that were provided in the newsletter. This means you have to be immediately ready to download, test, and deploy the latest security patches. Otherwise you are putting your website at risk. I'm only one person and not always have time to make an update as soon as it comes out. For me, performing these code updates are not difficult. However, performing those updates does take time. Time away from writing content, sleep, or doing something more useful with your time. Speed Counts A static website will always be faster than a website that uses a database. The way that Drupal is setup, the database would been called each time a page was accessed. From there, the database would returned a cached version of the page. Load times is one of the factors that Google takes into account when it comes to search ranking. So the faster your page loads, the higher your ranking on search engines. Harder To Hack Content Management Systems usually have a way to login to them. This \"doorway\" for login allows hackers or similar users to gain access to your website and make changes. Static websites do not have login or authentication system. Now I know what you're saying... you can hack the webhost directly. Yes that is true, but you have the know the name of the webhost server. Most of the time, the website does not have the name as the web server, thus making it more difficult to access and hack. The Cons You Have to Rebuild the Entire Website One downside to using Mkdocs, is that when you make one change, you have to rebuild the entire website. There's no way, that I am aware of, that will allow you to update and deploy a single page. This is one of the common complaints that I have read about Mkdocs and other static site generators. At the time, it is not a big deal for me to use a static site generator as I do not have a lot of content. I did read that one website had over 1,500 posts and that it took two hours to generate the entire website using Jekyll. Limited Themes I looked for themes to use that were similar to my current website. Let's just say that there was not many. After doing several searches and finding other blogs that used Mkdocs, I found and chose the Material theme for my blog. It allows you to do some appearance customizations without having to do significant code changes to the theme. Conclusion Hopefully this provides you with insight on whether you should consider changing your website over to a static website.","title":"Switched Blog from Drupal to MkDocs"},{"location":"blog/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#the-pros","text":"","title":"The Pros"},{"location":"blog/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#no-database","text":"A static website does not have a need for a database.

The conversion that I did for my website, took about 30-40 hours. That was a combination of a few evenings after work and a full weekend. To give you a perspective, I only had about 120 nodes on my Drupal site that had to be converted. Some of the more recent nodes, were already in Markdown format, so only formatting and presentation changes needed to be made. The other nodes were in various formats, including plain text and HTML (filter and full). Do The Setup In order to create a website with MkDocs, you will need to do some initial setup . I did my updates on Ubuntu. Therefore I was able to run sudo apt-get install mkdocs and the rest was done auto-magically. Setup is similar for Mac users. Windows users, you\u2019ll need to install Python and then the MkDocs pip package. Instructions on how to do this are available on the MkDocs website . Stop Creating Content Similar to how difficult it is to drain a bath tub if the water is still running, you will need to stop creating content until you do your migration. Otherwise, you will never complete the conversion process. I will admit, I did write two new posts while going through the conversion process. One about switching to Markdown and MkDocs and the other about raking leaves . Those posts, were written in new site that I was actively working on and not deployed to the old site since it was on the way to the digital landfill. Backup and Export The Database Before you start messing with your content, make a backup of the database and your website code and put it on a system that you will not be working on. That way if you do something wrong (yes it happened several times), then you have something that you can redo your changes from. I copied the production database of my website, as well as the master branch of code to my development server. Then I performed all of the updates in my development environment. I did it this way because that allows my website to continue to remain active. Also, in the worse case of making mistakes, which did happen, those mistakes were not seen by end users as only I have access to my development server. Convert Tables to Markdown Next was to get the posts and other website content into Markdown format. As previously mentioned, some of the content was written in HTML or plain text formats. What I chose to do was to write some database queries that would format the existing data into or close to the format that I wanted the markdown file to be in. The final output was contained in a column in a temporary table that I was using to make the necessary changes ad adjustments. The queries that I used to make this update are in the SQL file located at https://github.com/almostengr/almostengrwebsite/tree/master/migration_scripts . Using a number of update statements, I was able to convert the HTML syntax to Markdown. Some of the tags were too complex to convert, so I left those in the database and fixed them after I did the export to a text file. Export the Markdown Next, I did an export of the data to a CSV file. Now I only exported the column that had the finalized output and the title of each post. I did this using PHPMyAdmin as I have a MySQL database installed. Be sure to select the option that removes the carriage returns and line breaks from the export. After that, I assembled a command that would read each line in the CSV file, take the first column of the CSV file and put it into the body of the Markdown file and take the second column of the CSV file and use it to name the CSV file. This was done through the use of a while loop and the awk command. Take a look at csv_to_individual_files.sh script in the migration_scripts directory. After that, I did the file cleanup. The file clean up removed the additional characters that were present from the CSV file as well as converted the line breaks (<br /> tags) to new line characters. This way the final file will will not be one long line. Copy Images and Supporting Files Next, I copied the images that were used on my Drupal site into an images directory. I put all of the images into a single directory. Then I had to update the Markdown files to use relative paths to these files. Now you can use absolute references to the files, but that may cause you to miss errors when you are developing new content as you will need to use production URLs when setting up the links. If you do not have the image in production when creating new content, you will get no image or the alternate text for that image. Structure and Configure Your Website Blog Categories How you structure your website can make a big difference when it comes to SEO and user experience. When I used Drupal, all I had to do was select the appropriate taxonomy category and the URL part was handled. With the Markdown site, I\u2019m having to do the structure manually. I found it best to place each post in a folder based upon the category that it was intended for. In addition, I named each file with the date that I created the article and the title of the article. By having this information in the URL, it better helps the search engines index my blog. My folders tree looks similar to the following: docs | index.md | 2018 | 2018.02.13-use-twitter-and-rules-for-farmos-notifications/ | 2018.01.23-raspitraffic-demo,-us-signaling/ | 2018.01.16-raspberry-pi-first-run-and-installing-updates/ | 2019 | 2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.20-blog-reverse-sort-with-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps Sort by Date One of the downfalls to using Markdown, is that it sorts by alphabetical and numeric order. Meaning that my oldest posts would show up first. Nobody wants to have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the latest post that you wrote. What I needed up having to do was to leverage the find , sort , and sed commands to list the files in reverse order. Once I got them in the most recent post first order, I put them into the MkDocs configuration file (mkdocs.yml). After they were in the configuration file, then I added group headings based on the categories. The code that I used for this is available in the sort_by_latest_post.sh file in the migration_scripts directory. Proofread, Proofread, Proofread I went through each of the posts and attempted to correct as many of the formatting and Markdown errors that I could. Some of the errors, I realized were due to a lack of formatting that was done during the database step. So I truncated the temporary table and updated the update database query so that the additional formatting changes could be applied there instead of having to use sed or some other command via the terminal. Some of the HTML formatting I could not remove because of some of the difficulties of trying to match some particular text. So I left it in place for it to be manually modified. As I mentioned earlier, I only had about 120 pages that I had to go through and correct. If you have a blog with thousands or more posts, you may want to have a team help you or build more queries that will make the necessary code updates before deploying. Deploy To Production Not Exactly Perfect Once I was satisfied, I deployed it to production. There are some articles that do not have images contained in them because the image link is incorrect. There are other images that are way too large for the post, and I will need to resize them to make them more appropriate. I will do that at a later date. I deployed my updated site by using the mkdocs gh-deploy command. This creates a separate branch on your repo to deploy to. Then it will generate the static files for your website and push those files to the gh-pages branch. Set up Automated Pull or CI I added a cron job on my production instance that will periodically pull the latest version of the gh-pages to the production server. This will eliminate my need to login to the production instance unless there is a critical failure with the script or something else goes wrong. If you are not able to do a cron job, you can also use a CI server that will do the production deployment for you. Travis is one that is popular to use with Github. Conclusion I am happy with the new setup. The biggest advantage is that I do not have to spend time performing module updates or backups of the Drupal database. Further more, the simplicity of writing blog posts much better as I do not need specialized tools to complete the task.","title":"Blog Conversion Steps"},{"location":"blog/2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps/#blog-conversion-steps","text":"If you read my previous post , you found out why I chose to migrate away from a CMS (Content Management System).

When I explained the type of work that I did, I often related it to calling customer service when your internet or electricity goes out and you call to report them problem. I was a Level 2 agent for 5 years and then Level 1.5 agent for 2 years (L1.5 is a role they made up to keep providing services for the client). During this time period, I learned a lot as well as demonstrated skills that others had not seen before. Hopefully my experiences that I share, help you be successful in your role. 1) Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire I worked several issues that required to have the client involved in fixing the issue or the issue was reported by the client. In some of those situations, when the client was asked when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it would be like 3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself, wanted to stay at work later than necessary. In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that was next to a dry wooded wilderness (meaning it was not serious at the moment but had the potential to be). If the deadline that was given to you seems unrealistic to accomplish, ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the right questions, there is a change that, you will have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want, or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening. 2) Work Your Hours and Leave If you do not have an on call rotation for your job, you may skip this section. During my entire time in this role, I had to be on call. There was a primary on call rotation, but they were responsible for the initial triage of tickets that were sent to our group. It was never stated, but everyone was on call all the time for the respective applications that he or she supported. Initially I would sometimes work additional hours in addition to the time being on call. After experiencing some burnout of working 50 and 60+ hour weeks, that changed quickly. My perspective became that I would work the required 40 hours per week and on call as scheduled, but that was it. While some issues were quick to fix, other issues would take days to fix because of their complexity or effort required. Because of these reasons and more, I worked the minimum amount of hours, as you never know when that major production issue will come in. If it comes in and you already have 50+ hours clocked for the week, you will experience burnout and make more mistakes due to fatigue and lack of sleep. Example There was two week span that several major issues occurred for the applications that I was the primary and secondary support for. I had to step up and work both, as the primary for the application that I was the secondary support for, was on vacation. Somewhere during that second week, I made a mistake in resolving one of the issues, which resulted in more work having to be done. My manager had to explain this mistake to the client manager and the client manager asked why I was making these kind of mistakes given that it was not the first time that I had worked on this type of issue and that I was experienced with the clients' systems. My manager relayed this question to me and I did not know why. It occurred to me in hindsight that it was exhaustion from the additional hours having to be worked and doing double the work that I would normally do. Example Had a production issue come in for one of my applications while I was working my normal hours for the day. This issue required manually rolling back the data that had been loaded due to bad formatting of the data file. There were some time constraints also, because there was a monthly process that ran related to the client billing their clients. It had to be done and I was the one that had to do it. In total, I spent over 20+ hours being awake and worked at least a good 16 hours on this single issue. I was glad when the issue was resolved and received no push back on requesting the day off on short notice. 3) Documentation One thing that I have learned is that documentation is an essential part of working in production support and help desk environments. If someone cannot understand what is written, then it does not have any use. If You Can't Explain It To A Six Year Old Einstein has been claimed to have said that \"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself\". One of the managers had a similar phrase about if a random person off the street cannot do the steps in the document correctly, then the document was not well written. I agree with both of these statements. The last thing that you want to do is be contacted to resolve an issue that you already wrote documentation for it being misunderstood. If you write a document, and you are the only one that understands what is being done in the document and how to properly perform the steps in the document, that document needs to be redone. Screenshots When I first started writing documentation for our Level 1 support group, I would just write the steps or commands to be executed. After a few mishaps with the Level 1 Support team performing steps, I started to include a screenshot of each step being performed. Did this help reduce the number of errors? Yes it did. In some cases, certain tickets never got escalated to me because the document covered all scenarios and was through. If the command was copied and pasted incorrectly (usually due to the documentation website adding special characters or copying text from a Word document and pasting it directly into a Unix or Linux session) or they did not see the button on the screen that they were to click, they could use the screenshot to verify what it should look like on the screen before reporting it as bad documentation. Good clear instructions with screenshots of the step to perform will reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the human errors that occur with resolving tickets. Find and RTFM (Read The Freaking Manual) Larger vendors provide a manual or some kind of documentation for their products. At one point during my career, the client did a major upgrade of Autosys. It was a significant upgrade as they were going from Autosys 4 to Autosys 11. That big of an upgrade meant that there was limited backwards capabilities. From what I understand, no or limited documentation was provided to the development teams and little training was provided to the support teams. I took it upon myself to find the documentation for the new version that was being upgraded to, as I looking to making adjustments to some jobs that were already in place. Over time, the conversion from one version to the next did cause some production issues. By having the latest Autosys manual document provided by the vendor, I was able to help resolve some of the issues that occurred with the transition. In addition, I was asked to share it with the developers and other support teams because they wanted to see what was different and to be able to get more out of the new system. 4) How to Automate If an issue is recurring and can be automated, then I would suggest that you automate it. Some people freak-out at the thought of automating things because they feel that if you automate enough, you will automate yourself out of a job. From my experience, that was far from the truth. Automating helped reduce the amount of hours that I worked outside of normal business hours. Writing Code You need to know how to write code. Even if you are not great at it, being able to automate mundane, repetitive tasks will save you lots of time over the duration of your career. From writing code from scratch, to pasting bits and pieces of code from Stack overflow and other websites, you can improve your efficiencies and productivity by automating. If you do not know how to code, you can learn how to do so in your free time. What language should you learn? That depends on what languages or systems that you client uses. As mentioned earlier, mine used Linux, Oracle, and other systems, so I became proficient in writing Shell Scripts and using SQL Plus, just to name a couple. Example After a realignment of the team, I became the primary support for a new set of applications. One of those applications had a process that ran on the last three days of the month and the first of the month. Part of that process was that it wrote the date of the first of the month to that file. Problem was that when the process ran on the first of the month, the date was supposed to be for the previous month. For instance, if it was the end of October or the first of November, then we had to make sure that the date in the file was for the first of October. Come to find out, this was a bug that the development team had made a change to, but regression testing was not performed on it. The development team did not consider it urgent as there was a work around available and the business team had back log items that had to be completed by a particular deadline. What was being done by the agent that previously supported the application is that he was getting up in the early hours of the morning, around 1 AM, to manually update the date in the file and start the process. Once I took over the application, I had to start doing the same. What I would do is work my normal shift and then stay up until 1 AM to make the update and start the process as I did not want to sleep through the alarm as this process not running would have a major business impact. After about the third month, I had had enough of doing that and looked into automating it. What the previous agent and myself came up with was a shell script that would run at 1 AM, check the current date, and based on a number of if conditions, write the appropriate date to the file. After a confirmation run of the fix, this fix was presented to the development team. As a result, the development team added it to the code base. Also I did not have to stay up late nights on the first of the month just to edit a text file. 5) Jump the Firewall In some companies, the technology used is so specific to and designed just for that organization, that there are no resources outside of the company that can help resolve or diagnose issues. This is a difficult for individuals that provide support for these components. Other companies do use more name brand technology products, like Oracle, Java, or Linux. There is plenty of documentation on how to use these products and what the error message or exception messages mean and resolution steps. Keep the Privates, Private Going outside of the firewall was frowned upon in some situations as you could risk putting NPI (Non Public Information) or company secrets into the public. I am not suggesting that you ever submit private data or company secrets on a form on the public internet as you do not know where that information will end up. Errors and How To Do I am saying that you can look up an error message to find the answer to a problem that you are having to quickly resolve issues. As I mentioned earlier, the less issues that you have to deal with, the more time that you have to work on other things. This applies to non production issues and items. 6) Share What You Know There is a common notion that if you share what you know, then somebody else can do what you know how to do and then you will be out of a job. While in some industries, that may be true, from my experience it is false. My experience has been that if you know, that allows others to do what you do and allows you to do more and new things. When I worked on tickets that came in, I was sure to include SQL queries, SSH session logs, application logs, and any other information that I used to resolve an issue. Why? Because the last thing I want to have happen, is to get called for an issue when I am on vacation or to have the on-call person call me to resolve an issue that's simple as restarting a process. In some situations, the on-call person was able to resolve the current occurrence of an issue, based on the previous occurrence of an issue that had my notes and other information attached. Example One of the applications (App A) that I supported, was upgraded and set up on a new virtual machine (Server A). As part of the new VM setup, it also got a new IP address. The old server (Server B) was powered down. An interfacing system (App B) was not able to connect to App A. The individual that was the support contact for App B, said that he could not connect to App A from his computer or App B server. I checked the server for App A, and App A was online and running as it should be. After discussing the issue, we compared the IP address that App B had and the IP address that Server B currently had. Come to find out, App B had cached the IP address for Server B for App A. Since Server B was offline as it had been replaced by Server A, App B was saying that it could not connect to App A. It was at this point, I had to tell support agent for App B that he had to clear the DNS cache for App B and then try to connect again. He was not familiar with this so he had to reach out someone else to provide him the info on how to do this. Once he cleared the cache and restarted the process, the connection was successful. He was able to document those steps so that if the issue were to happen again in the future, that he would be prepared and not have to get additional people involved. 7) Minimize Distractions One thing that I have learned, is that modern work environment is not really conducive to getting a lot of work done. I have discovered that some people come to work extra early or stay extra late because they can get work done without being interrupted. What I had to start doing was to minimize the amount of distractions that were coming my way. Visual Distractions That notification that you got an email. That notification of a new instant message. That notification that there are updates for your computer. Turn them all off. If the email is that important, the sender will let you know by following up immediately. If the IM (instant message) is that important, they would have called or came directly to your desk. You can install the updates to your computer when you do not have to be actively working or after you leave for the day. Audio Distractions When I worked, I would listen to music or even audio books to block out the sounds of other people eating, gossiping, on meetings, or the toilet flushing. Sometimes the work required deep focus, such as analyzing the data in a spreadsheet or writing code for the automation that you are trying to build (see item 4). Email Management Email is one of those things that can easily get on your nerves. I had to leverage a number of built in features that Outlook has to get the most of out my email and scheduling. Rules and Categories Set up rules and categories in outlook based on keywords or senders that you get emails from. If you get emails that you know does not require you to read or perform any action on, then create a rule that will automatically send those emails to the trash. Create Meetings from Email Did you know that you can create a meeting invite from an email? What's more cool, is that the invite will have all of the people that were on the email included in it. All you have to do is open the email that you want to create a meeting for, click the \"Meeting\" button in the toolbar. The Meeting Request screen will appear so that you can finalize the details. Then you click Send. Group Conversations By grouping the email conversations by subject, it made it far easier for me to get through all of the emails that were in my inbox. If there was a email thread that I did not need to read or pay attention to, then I could delete the entire thread in a single actions since the thread was grouped together. Conclusion Working in the production support / help desk role can be difficult and very stressful at times. Hopefully these tips have provided you some strategies on how to make your help desk / support role easier to deal with.","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"blog/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#7-lessons-learned-as-production-support-or-help-desk-agent","text":"","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"blog/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#background","text":"I worked for 7 years in Production Support role.

In some of those situations, when the client was asked when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it would be like 3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself, wanted to stay at work later than necessary. In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that was next to a dry wooded wilderness (meaning it was not serious at the moment but had the potential to be). If the deadline that was given to you seems unrealistic to accomplish, ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the right questions, there is a change that, you will have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want, or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening.","title":"1) Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire"},{"location":"blog/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#2-work-your-hours-and-leave","text":"If you do not have an on call rotation for your job, you may skip this section.

Initially I would sometimes work additional hours in addition to the time being on call. After experiencing some burnout of working 50 and 60+ hour weeks, that changed quickly. My perspective became that I would work the required 40 hours per week and on call as scheduled, but that was it. While some issues were quick to fix, other issues would take days to fix because of their complexity or effort required. Because of these reasons and more, I worked the minimum amount of hours, as you never know when that major production issue will come in.

I agree with both of these statements. The last thing that you want to do is be contacted to resolve an issue that you already wrote documentation for it being misunderstood.

In some cases, certain tickets never got escalated to me because the document covered all scenarios and was through. If the command was copied and pasted incorrectly (usually due to the documentation website adding special characters or copying text from a Word document and pasting it directly into a Unix or Linux session) or they did not see the button on the screen that they were to click, they could use the screenshot to verify what it should look like on the screen before reporting it as bad documentation.

From what I understand, no or limited documentation was provided to the development teams and little training was provided to the support teams. I took it upon myself to find the documentation for the new version that was being upgraded to, as I looking to making adjustments to some jobs that were already in place.

In the process, I came across one user that had a \"uses\" page on his website. On this page, he stated that he was inspired by Wes Bos to create a uses page. Wes Bos created a website called uses.tech that is a collection of the users that have submitted their uses page to his repository. What Is A Uses Page? A uses page includes the things that a developer or other individual uses to do what they do best. For software developers, it may include the type of computer that they have, the IDE or text editor that they use, and the languages that they program with. How Do I Format My Uses Page? However you chose! When looking at other uses pages, I saw that some categorized their page based on the type of tools. Others categorized their set up in different ways. There is no particular way that it must be done other than the fact that you need to include the tools that you use. Some list out just the hardware and software that they use. Others get very detailed to include the hardware specifications, number of computers, and even photographing their home office or desk setup. Some even add the furniture that they have in their office as hardware components. You can look at the uses pages that have already been submitted on the uses.tech website for inspiration. On mine, I have included the software, computer hardware, and development environment details for my particular setup. Depending on what I am working on, I will use Linux or Windows. Therefore, I separated my software list by the operating system that I use it on. You can check out my uses page to see what my current set up includes. How Will Others Find My Uses Page? First you will need to create your uses page. Then, you will need to add it and other details about yourself to the awesome-uses repository. Once your pull request has passed all of the checks and is approved, your uses page will be listed on uses.tech website and in the README of the awesome-uses repository. How Did I Build My Uses Page? I came up with the organization of my uses page by doing the following in order: I looked at the Uses page of others that were listed on the uses.tech site as well as on GitHub to see what they included on their pages. I decided how I wanted to organize the content. Since I use multiple systems for my work, I decided to list each computer system or server as hardware and to separate the software by operating system. I also included the tools uses to build and manage this website. I provided links to some of the items that have websites for the products. That way visitors can download or purchase the same tools that you have. I published my uses page . I created an entry on the awesome-uses repo that pointed to the Uses page on my website. NOTE: I had some errors in my pull request to the awesome-uses repo. As a result, the CI would not allow my pull request to be sent for approval until I corrected the errors that it found.

Here are some of the main reasons for making the switch: Drupal 7 has been replaced with Drupal 8. That means the content would need to be migrated to the new platform. However, all the functionality may not be available, as some modules are still being converted to work on Drupal 8. Blogging with a static site puts you at less risk of hacking, encountering database issues, and page load speed. I discuss this further in another post weighing the pros and cons of switching. Old Process with Drupal Login to Drupal Had to login to Drupal each time that I wanted to make an update to my blog. This mean that I was less likely to make that update over public WiFi, because public WiFi means that your site could be a greater risk for being hacked. Ignore that Message About Security Updates Available Now I did not always ignore this message, but majority of the time I did. Why? Because when the thought of a new content came to mind, I wanted to get as much of the thought out of my head and onto digital paper as possible. Fooling around and trying to get those updates installed before getting the thoughts out meant that I would risk loosing the thought, thus no new content. On the other prospective, not getting those security updates in place would leave the site at risk . Write The Content... In A Word Processor I know it does not make sense, but let me explain. While some browsers do have spell check, I have not ran across one that has grammar check. That said, I know that I make mistakes typing and have to go back and correct those mistakes. However, I would rather to get it right the first time than to have to correct it in a future update or somebody telling me about my mistake. Move the Content to the Website Once I have done all the grammar and spell checking in the word processor, I would then copy and paste that content into the website and preview it. With previewing, it would allow me to see that the content was formatted correctly before publishing. Once I would confirm that all was well, then I would publish the content. Take a Backup Since things could go wrong with Drupal when performing the database updates, per the Drupal documentation, it was recommended that you always backed up the database before running the database updates function. I have had a few sites go wrong when performing the database updates and it was not easy getting them back online since I did not have recent backups. In some of the modules, the maintainers were not using database transactions in their update functions. So if part of the update ran and failed, you would have a partial-ran database update but Drupal would see it as if the full update had completed successfully. Problem with Drupal seeing it as the full update running, is that it would not let you re-run that specific update again. So that meant that you had to either tinker in the database and manually update the version number to the previous version so that the database update could be ran again or restore the database with the backup and run the update again. Either of those options were not ideal and definitely were time consuming. Those Security Updates If I was using the right computer, I would then download the available security updates into my development computer. Confirmed that nothing blew up in the process with Drupal's database updater. Then commit those updates to my website's version control. Then pull the latest version into my production environment and run Drupal's database updater and prayed the entire time that things would work as they should. New Process with MkDocs Fetch Latest Repo On any computer of my choosing that has git installed, I can get the latest the latest version of Markdown code of my website and make updates to it. Edit in Text Editor or Word Processor Since the content that I am going to edit is already on the computer, I do not have to do anything special to get them into a word processor for editing. It is just as simple as File > Open > select the file > start typing. Save and Commit Once I have made all of the edits that need to be made, I can save my changes in the word processor and then commit them to my version control. Then push that branch up to the origin. Generate Static Files and Deploy I have my development environment set up with MkDocs. So I login to that server and run the git pull command followed by mkdocs gh-deploy command. The static HTML, CSS, and JS files are generated and committed to a local branch and then I am prompted to enter by GitHub credentials. Automated Pull in Production My production instance has a cronjob set up that does a pull of the branch that contains the static website. It does this pull several times per day. In a sense, it it like having a CD (continuous deployment) set up in that environment. Future Considerations Expanded CI-CD Setup One of the future goals that I have is to expand my current deployment set up so that it will periodically pull the master branch and automatically run the gh-deploy command on it. I looked into having all of this done in my production environment, but my website host provider will not allow me to install Python packages on their shared server. Thus will have to continue to generate the static website files locally. GitHub Actions GitHub Actions allows you to do testing and deployment when an event occurs on your repository. For example, if you push code from your remote to the origin, GitHub Actions can be triggered to run tests on the operating system of your choosing with whatever else is required to complete the testing (Python install, PHP install, etc). Based upon what I currently have in place, it seems to be the more viable option. I already have a script that runs in my production environment that periodically pulls the static website pages. Thus I never have to login to production to deploy my website.

To go back to your home directory, you enter the command below in. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ cd Creating New Folder To create a new folder, you use the command below. You will need to replace anewfolder with the name of the folder that you want to create. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ mkdir nanewfolder Once you have ran the command above, you can use the ls command to confirm that the folder has been created. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Predefined Aliases On some systems, the directories are highlighted a different color from the files. Ubuntu is one of the systems that does this out of the box. The reason is because there is an alias defined for the ls command. I showed what was really running when performing the ls by showing the alias. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias ls alias ls='ls --color=auto' Removing Folders and Files If you attempt to remove a directory without specifying the recursive option, the system will complain that the action cannot be done. The system will not allow you to delete a folder without deleting the child elements in that folder because that would leave the child elements orphaned on the system. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm anewfolder/ rm: cannot remove 'anewfolder/': Is a directory almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt The recursive option still must be used even if the directory is empty. This time the remove command is run with the recursive option and the folder is removed. The rm command does not return any output unless there is an error executing the command. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm -r anewfolder/ almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Below are examples of commands that you do not want to run. If you do run any of the commands, they will result in the entire file system being deleted. Some of these require that the executing user have sudo permissions. The commands in the example below have been commented out so that they cannot be intentionally run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -r /* almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -rf /* The equivalent of the above commands is going to the root / directory and running the commands below. The commands in the example have intentionally been commented out so that they cannot be easily run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd / almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ ls almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f f * To find all of the options an example of the rm command, you can enter in the the help argument to the command. The help page wil display different output depending on the distrubution of Linux that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ rm --help For more information about the command, you can use the man page. The output from this will vary depending on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ man rm Autocomplete can be used with the rm command as well. Just type part of the file name and double press the Tab key to have the system type the rest of the file or to present you with files that match the pattern. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm cop copiedfile.csv copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm copyofsample* copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt Below, I show that \"sample\" as the pattern matched two files. However, \" s e*\" matches three files. Using this wildcard pattern can result in you deleting files that you do not want to delete. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls *s*e* almostengr.txt copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt If you are not sure what all files will match a pattern, run the pattern of your choice with the ls command first before running the rm command. Recovering Deleted Files Recovering delete files on Linux is not an easy task unless you use a disk recovery utility. On Windows-based systems, when a file is deleted, it goes to the Recycle Bin. Linux has no concept of the Recycle Bin. There is a way that the Recycle Bin concept can be done. To set up your makeshift Recycle Bin on Linux, you can create an alias for the rm command or use a different alias that will move the file to a different directory instead of deleting the file. alias rm=\"mv $@ /var/tmp\" If you use the command above as an alias, any time that you use the rm command, it will move the file to the /var/tmp directory instead. Periodically, you will need to \"empty the trash\" by removing the files from the /var/tmp directory. Clear The Screen Clearing the screen will do what it says. The prompt will be moved to the top of the screen. On some systems, this will limit whether you can scroll back or not. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ clear Copying Files To display the help information for using the file copy, use the --help option. The help page will vary based on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp --help This is the list of directory contents before performing a file copy. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt If you do not remember the filename that you want to copy or the filename is long that you do not want to type it, then you can use auto-complete to have the system complete the filename for you. Start by typing part of the file name in the prompt. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p d Then double press the Tab key and you will get the following. data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy/ Since there are multiple matches for files that start with \"d\", the system will not automatically guess which one that you are trying to type. Instead it will list all of the files that match the criteria that you have defined so that you can pick which one. The same will happen now that we have typed \"data\" in the prompt as there are two files that being with \"data\" in this directory. From here we can type an additional character that matches the file that we want to use in our command and it will complete the rest of the filename. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data data2.csv data.csv \"data2.csv\" is the file that is being copied to \"copiedfile.csv\". To confirm that the file has been copied, we run the ls command with the file names that were used in the cp command as arguments to only show those two files. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data2.csv copiedfile.csv almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al data2.csv copiedfile.csv Since we used the -p option in our file copy, the original and copied file will have the same last modified date and time. -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 copiedfile.csv -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 data2.csv Going to copy the file that we created to another file. This time without using the preserve option. Also going to use the wild card with the ls command to show both files instead of specifying each file name. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp sample.txt copysofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al *sample* -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:15 copyofsample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Since the -p option was not used when copying the file, the copied file will have the current timestamp (22:15). Creating Files To create a file, you can use the touch command. The file will be created with the name that you provide. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ touch sample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al sample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Viewing File Contents There are many ways of viewing file contents. To display an entire file on the screen, you use cat . almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cat data2.csv id,first_name,last_name,email,region,country 1,Christian,Walls,non.hendrerit.id@a.net,Manitoba,Spain

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified. In most circumstances, this listing will not be useful as it will not have any of the date or time information presented. almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -1t mailcap systemd shells host.conf python sysctl.d tmpfiles.d legal rc0.d security groff networks rc1.d modules-load.d logcheck profile rc2.d dpkg polkit-1 manpath.config rc3.d alternatives subgid- pam.conf rc4.d skel subuid- bash.bashrc rc5.d vim kernel bash_completion rc6.d ssh pm mke2fs.conf logrotate.d ssl X11 zsh_command_not_found init.d localtime network updatedb.conf fail2ban timezone crypttab debconf.conf default sudoers.d acpi ucf.conf bash_completion.d dhcp apm hdparm.conf monit apparmor gss at.deny python2.7 hostname perl nanorc ld.so.cache locale.gen fonts magic update-motd.d subgid kernel-img.conf magic.mime cron.weekly subuid mtab libaudit.conf cron.daily gshadow terminfo gai.conf update-manager group vtrgb rsyslog.conf lvm shadow newt login.defs apparmor.d passwd python3 securetty apport netplan iproute2 sudoers ufw machine-id xdg sysctl.conf rsyslog.d pollinate cron.hourly crontab profile.d fstab cron.monthly overlayroot.conf cloud issue ca-certificates.conf logrotate.conf vmware-tools issue.net modules deluser.conf pam.d os-release nsswitch.conf rmt cryptsetup-initramfs lsb-release ca-certificates debian_version mdadm passwd- dbus-1 inputrc modprobe.d shadow- adduser.conf sos.conf cron.d hosts.allow resolv.conf protocols iscsi hosts.deny environment rpc initramfs-tools NetworkManager ld.so.conf.d services console-setup dnsmasq.d selinux ltrace.conf grub.d rcS.d opt mailcap.order udev dnsmasq.d-available hosts mime.types python3.6 group- update-notifier bindresvport.blacklist ldap gshadow- ethertypes ld.so.conf thermald byobu landscape screenrc depmod.d popularity-contest.conf wgetrc fuse.conf networkd-dispatcher calendar binfmt.d apt libnl-3 locale.alias Listing Only Directories You can list only the directories using the ls command.

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified.

When my place was quiet, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom. It was not loud. I removed the lid of the tank and to my suprise the water was at the top of the overflow tube. Definitely not a good sign. Not sure how long it had that slow leak, but I wanted to fix it before it got worse. I immediately shut off the water to the toilet to prevent any more water from being wasted. I have other bathrooms that I was able to use, so I was not concerned with this one leaking. However, if you only have one toilet and choose to turn the water off, you will need to turn it on after each flush so that it can refill. I'll share with you the 8 steps that I took to replace the fill valve on a toilet. 1) Gather The Tools Needed In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional) 2) Shut Off The Water Before you do anything, turn off the water. If you do not turn off the water before disconnecting the hoses or the fill valve, then you will flood your bathroom. To turn off the water, you can turn it off at the shut off valve on the left side of the toilet. If you do not have a shut off valve next to the toilet, then you will have to turn off the water to the entire home. This shut off valve could be located either outside or in the basement of the home. Once you have located the shut off valve, turn the knob to the right until it stops. 3) Remove the Water Remove the lid from the toilet tank (aka the back of the toilet). Flush the toilet and hold the lever down until most or all of the water runs out. Then you will need to remove the remaining water using one of the following methods: use a towel to soak up the water and wring it out in the bowl or sink allow the water to evaporate (the method I chose); this may take a couple of weeks to happen Jump to step 5 and replace a bucket below the fill valve opening before you unscrew it 4) Purchase Replacement Parts You will need to get a replacement fill valve. I bought a universal one, similar to the one pictured above. It has the same size fitting that connects to the water supply line. I also bought a replacement supply line. You do not have to do this. However, in the past 4 years, I have replaced almost all of the working parts of this toilet. Thus going ahead to replace the supply line as I do not know how long ago it was replaced. 5) Remove Old Fill Valve and Supply Line I disconnected the supply line from the water line and the fill valve. You may have to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the line. If the water line (that is the pipe that comes out of the wall) has Teflon tape on it, you will want to remove it at this time. Teflon tape is white, but pay be discolored depending on how long it has been on the fitting. Then I removed the fill valve from the tank, by removing the nut that is located on the bottom side of the tank. I was kinda suprised that this had not started leaking sooner. If you notice at the bottom of this valve, the rubber gasket has significantly warped to the point that it was no longer in its original shape. 6) Install New Fill Valve and Supply Line The fill valve that I purchased, has an adjustable height. Per the instructions listed on the box, I the fill valve needs to be 3 inches higher than the overflow tube.

Do not use pilers or tools when tightening plastic parts. I say this twice because it really is important. The reason being is that you risk stripping or breaking the plastic parts. Plastic parts are usually designed to be hand-tightened only. If you break a plastic part, there is a chance that you will not be able to buy the broken part by itself, thus wasting money.

The reason that the Teflon tape is used to fill the gap that may exist between two connections or fittings. It is especially recommended that it be used on metal to metal fittings as they may leak of the rubber gasket is not seated properly. I only put the Teflon tape on the metal fittings. However, you can use it on the plastic fittings as well. 7) Turn On The Water Once you have checked and double checked the connections, slowly turn on the water. If you turn on the water slowly, then you are less likely to have a flood if a leak springs. Furthermore, if you turn the water knob 5 times and then find a leak, you have to turn it in the opposite direction 5 times to stop the water. Flush the toilet several times to make sure that the fill valve works as it should. 8) Adjust the Fill Rate This particular fill value has adjustable knobs for the tank water level and the bowl water level. Be sure to adjust these accordingly so that you are not wasting water by overfilling. Conclusion This was a rather quick replacement. In total, it took about an hour to complete. Part of that was having to walk back and forth to get tools and supplies. Also testing repeatedly to make sure that it works as it should.","title":"8 Steps to Replace A Toilet Fill Valve"},{"location":"blog/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve/#1-gather-the-tools-needed","text":"In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional)","title":"1) Gather The Tools Needed"},{"location":"blog/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve/#2-shut-off-the-water","text":"Before you do anything, turn off the water.

She requested that I perform the work. The initial discussion was about replacing a shrub, but expanded into doing more. As you can see, couple of the bushes had died and had been overtaken by weeds and grass. Per the conversation with the customer, a lawn care company (I am not going to mention the name) sprayed something on the bushes that was supposed to help them, but instead resulted in some of them dying. In addition, grass had started to grow up inside of the bed. Customer had used plastic bags as a weed barrier when she initially set up the bed. Also the lawn care professional that the customer uses, would sometimes cut too close to the bed. As a result, some of the rocks would be launched into the yard, sidewalk, or other location that they should not be. I suggested that brick pavers be used as a barrier to prevent this from happening going forward as nobody would be willing to run over bricks with a lawn mower as it could potentially destroy the mower. For the weed control, I recommended that landscape fabric be put down to prevent or hinder future weeds from growing, and using more lava rock as a mulch for the bed. Materials Used Materials used for this project were: Brick pavers Lava rock Landscape fabric one bush/shrub Remove Old Landscaping The old landscaping was removed. This included a combination of leaves, lava rock, and the black plastic weed barrier. The plan was that the lava rock be separated from the other materials in the bed. However, that proved to be a bit more difficult in execution. The existing rock, leaves, and weeds were raked, shoveled, and placed onto a tarp. In addition, the dead bushes were removed. One of the bushes was replaced with a new one. Install New Landscaping Before the landscape fabric was installed, all purpose fertizilzer was used to help the existing and new plants. The living shrubs were left in place. Since they were left, the landscape fabric was installed and cut to fit around the existing bushes. This would allow for the greatest amount of coverage to prevent weeds and grass from showing up in the beds. The old landscaping was removed and placed on the tarp.

Since the ground is mostly level, leveling the bricks did not take too much effort. In some areas, the ground was slightly higher. Those areas, were dug down using a shovel and pickaxe. Then the dirt was compacted down using a tamper to make sure it did not settle once the brick was placed on top of it.

The problem that I had is that I did not have anywhere to store the items so that they could properly dry out to be used in the firepit. Thus I built a firewood stand that would hold the wood until they were ready to be burned. What You Need Materials Needed 4 - 4\" x 4\" x 12' (10.16 cm x 10.16 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated posts 3 - 4\" x 2\" x 12' (10.16 cm x 5.08 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards 3 - 4\" x 1\" x 12' (10.16 cm x 2.54 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards exterior or deck screws or nails spray paint All of the parts that are used to build the stand are not included as I took this picture in the process of unloading the materials. Tools Needed Saw - miter saw makes this easier, but circular saw works for this as well drill Cut The Pieces Vertical Posts I made my stand 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. To get this height, I cut the 4\" x 4\" posts in half. Horizontal Pieces I made the stand 4 feet (1.22 m) long by 2 feet (0.61 m) wide. I used 2 of the the 4\" x 2\" lumber cut at 4 feet, 4 feet, and then 2 feet. The remaining 4 x 2 will be used as cross braces between the outer pieces. The cross braces were placed at 16 on center. Slats I did not cut the slats until after I had completed the assembly. That way, they would be cut to fit the shelving that was used. I had some pallet wood on hand, so I was able to use that instead of using 1x4 wood. Paint The Pieces I painted the bottom and tops of the vertical posts with spray paint. Since I was placing the firewood stand directly in contact with the ground, I wanted some protection against the water that it would be in contact with. Paint is not necessary the best way to prevent the wood from rotting, but it does offer better protection than setting the posts directly on the ground. I went up about 1 foot from the bottom of the post and painted it as well. The reason that I did this because when water hits the ground, it may splash up on the side of the post. Having paint up this far will provide protection against this splashing. I had black spray paint already on hand, so I used it. Regardless of which paint that you use, make sure that you use exterior grade paint. Exterior grade paint will offer you the best protection for the wood. Assemble The Pieces For my setup, I made the top of the bottom shelf 1 foot (0.30 m) from the ground. This will allow for sufficient air flow for all of the wood that has been stacked on it. The top shelf is about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the top of the post. This will make sure that the items that are on the top do not easily roll off when they are stacked. Pieces were secured together with 3 inch decking screws. I mentioned in the materials list, you may use nails for this as well. Conclusion This project was simple and only took a couple of hours to complete. As you can see from the photo, if you need to make it bigger or smaller to fit your space, then you can change the size of the horizontal pieces as necessary. In my case, the first one that I built, was not big enough.

Since I was placing the firewood stand directly in contact with the ground, I wanted some protection against the water that it would be in contact with. Paint is not necessary the best way to prevent the wood from rotting, but it does offer better protection than setting the posts directly on the ground. I went up about 1 foot from the bottom of the post and painted it as well. The reason that I did this because when water hits the ground, it may splash up on the side of the post. Having paint up this far will provide protection against this splashing. I had black spray paint already on hand, so I used it. Regardless of which paint that you use, make sure that you use exterior grade paint. Exterior grade paint will offer you the best protection for the wood.","title":"Paint The Pieces"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.08-build-firewood-stand/#assemble-the-pieces","text":"For my setup, I made the top of the bottom shelf 1 foot (0.30 m) from the ground. This will allow for sufficient air flow for all of the wood that has been stacked on it. The top shelf is about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the top of the post. This will make sure that the items that are on the top do not easily roll off when they are stacked. Pieces were secured together with 3 inch decking screws. I mentioned in the materials list, you may use nails for this as well.","title":"Assemble The Pieces"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.08-build-firewood-stand/#conclusion","text":"This project was simple and only took a couple of hours to complete. As you can see from the photo, if you need to make it bigger or smaller to fit your space, then you can change the size of the horizontal pieces as necessary.

Thus I built a stand stand that looks like this one.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.08-replacing-contactor-on-air-conditioner/","text":"The air conditioner stopped working at my home. Come to find out, one of the wires had burned off on the contactor, which resulted in a hot house in August. Definitely not something good. Take a look at the video to see how I diagnosed and fixed the issue. Video Video Transcript ONE DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NEXT YOU'RE GONNA DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES THAT RUN TO THE CONTACTOR BECAUSE AFTER YOU GET ALL OF THE WIRES DISCONNECTED THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR FOR MY PARTICULAR SITUATION THE CONTACTOR HAD SCREWS ON THE CONNECTING POINT SOME OF THEM DID HAVE THESE WHAT I CALL QUICK CONNECTORS BUT OTHER ONES HAD SCREWS ON THEM SO FOR THOSE OF HOW THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CONTACTOR YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES FROM THE CONTACTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT ALRIGHT FOLKS SO I GOT MY NEW CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE OVER HERE AND MY OLD CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE HERE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE SCREW ON THIS ONE ACTUALLY I HAD TO SCREW IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THERE SO BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THAT I'M NOTICED SO ON THE TOP OF THIS ONE ACTUALLY YOU STICK THE WIRE IN WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD A CLAMP THAT YOU PUT A CONNECTOR ON IT AND THEN YOU PUT THAT CONNECTOR AROUND THE SCREW HEAD SO THE TOP IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE THE BOTTOM NOW WHERE YOU STICK THE WHOLE WIRE IN AND THEN YOU SCREW THE TO CLAMP IT DOWN ALL THE WAY ALSO THE SAME NUMBER OF PINS HERE LOOKS TO BE THERE'S EIGHT ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S EIGHT ON THE TOP HERE I ONLY HAD I BELIEVE THOSE TWO WIRES HERE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR ITSELF I WON'T BE USING ALL OF THOSE PINS SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE WIRES AND THIS ONE ALSO IS ENCLOSED SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE COIL ON THIS ONE FROM BOTH SIDES SO BUT YOU CAN ON THIS ONE AND THE REASON BEING IS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TOOK ACCOUNT THAT HEY BUGS CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THIS THING AND CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THEY ACTUALLY SEAL IT UP ENTIRELY SO ALL THIS MECHANICAL STUFF LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE IT'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS HOWEVER YOU CAN TAKE THESE TWO SCREWS OFF AND THIS PLAY TO COME UP AND THEN IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS INSIDE UNDERNEATH THIS COVER HERE SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW CONTACTOR AND THE OLD CONTACTOR AND ONE OTHER DIFFERENCE THEY DID NOT HAVE IF YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THIS ONE IS RATED AT 25 AMPS AND THIS ONE IS RATED AT 30 SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME RATING BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PART JUST THE WRITING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO AS YOU SEE IS STILL OPERATING WITH A 24 VOLT COIL LIKE THIS ONE IS HERE AND SO IT'S ALSO A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AND BE SURE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SCREWS BECAUSE THIS THING DOES HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND TRYING TO FIND THE SCREWS THAT MATCH OR WILL FIT ME HOLES THAT IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OR CONDENSER IS PRETTY DIFFICULT I'M YOU COULD USE ONE OF THE OTHER SCREWS AND PUT IT THERE BUT AGAIN THE HASSLE OF GOING THROUGH THE STORE AND TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER SCREW TO REPLACE THAT ONE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO ONCE YOU GET THE OLD ONE OUT YOU CAN PUT THE NEW ONE IN AND PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN IS THE REVERSE STEPS OF TAKING THE OLD ONE OUT AND MY PARTICULAR SCENARIO I HAD WIRES THAT BURNED I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS JUST AN ARC OR JUST CORROSION OR MAYBE EVEN A CRITTER OR SOMETHING GOT INTO THE EAR AND SHORTER THINGS OUT BUT NONETHELESS THE WIRES WERE BURNED AS I SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN THE VIDEO SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT MORE WIRE CUT OFF THE BURNT SECTION IDEALLY THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WIRE LEFT IN HERE IF NOT YOU MAY HAVE TO WHAT THEY CALL KIND OF LIKE PIGTAIL SO YOU PUT IN A NEW WIRE OF A LONGER LINK AND JOIN THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RESIZE IT BACK TO THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH BUT IN MY CASE I HAVE PLENTY OF WIRE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND SO THAT ADDING ADDITIONAL WIRE WAS NOT NECESSARY I WAS JUST ABLE TO CUT OFF WHAT I HAD AND WIRE IT IN THE CONTACTOR THAT I'M USING DOES NOT HAVE THE QUICK CONNECTORS ON IT OR REQUIRED THAT THEY BE USED AND SO WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WAS TO STICK THE CONNECTOR I'M EXCUSE ME TO STICK THE WIRE INTO THE HOLE AND THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW DOWN AND THAT HELD THE WIRE IN PLACE TO THE CONNECTOR SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT QUICK CONNECTOR ON THERE ANYMORE ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING CONNECTED YOU'LL NEED TO REARRANGE THE WIRES AND SECURE THEM BACK INSIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE OR THE PANEL IDEALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER IF YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES ORIGINALLY BEFORE I PULL THIS PANEL UP ALL THE WIRES WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER IN A LARGE BUNDLE WITH A ZIP TIE SO TRY TO PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE YOU START MESSING WITH IT THAT WAY YOU CAN ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAVE THE ENTIRE WIRE SET WRAPPED IN BUNDLES I MEAN EXCUSE ME WRAPPED IN ZIP WITH A SINGLE ZIP TIE LIKE IT WAS BEFORE AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING FITS THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE I STARTED MESSING WITH THINGS AND THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE CROSSED OVER OR ALL THOSE TYPE OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHORT OUT THE SYSTEM OR CAUSE YOURSELF FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT YOU OR A TECHNICIAN MAY HAVE TO FIX ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE WIRES IN PLACE AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO THEN GO FLIP ON THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS AS IT SHOULD ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE CONDITIONING AGAIN YOU WANT TO DO THIS BEFORE YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON BECAUSE IF YOU TEST IT AFTER YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON AND SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER BACK OFF WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT NOW I KNOW ON SOME SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CONTACTOR AND THE CAPACITOR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE FAN OFF AND SOME OTHER COMPONENTS SO IN THAT CASE IF YOUR SYSTEM IS SET UP THAT WAY YOU'LL NEED TO PUT THOSE ITEMS BACK ON BEFORE TESTING BECAUSE IF THE FAN IS NOT SECURED AND YOU SWITCH IT ON THE FAM MAY DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE UNIT AND ALSO BE A HAZARD TO ANYBODY THAT WOULD BE STANDING NEARBY IF IT WERE TO COME APART FROM THE SYSTEM ONCE YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE THEN YOU CAN PUT THE PANEL AND SCREWS BACK IN PLACE AND THAT WILL BE IT ALSO WHILE YOU'RE AT IT YOU CAN CHECK THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CONDITION COAL SUCH AS THE LINES THAT RUN IN AND OUT AS WELL AS THE WIRING THAT GOES IN AND OUT TO THAT UNIT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO DO THAT SINCE YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO DO REPAIRS ON THAT TO LOOK IT OVER AS WELL AND I'VE BEEN MENTIONING IT EARLIER IN THE VIDEO BUT IF YOU HAVE BUGS OR ANYTHING INSIDE THE PLACE WHERE THE CONTACTOR AND CAPACITOR ARE TRY TO CLEAN THOSE OUT THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THOSE ARE THE CULPRITS FOR YOUR CAPACITOR OR CONTACTOR TO STOP WORKING THEY SOMETIMES WILL CRAWL IN THERE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE CAPACITOR THEY ACTUALLY CRAWL INSIDE OF THE CAPACITOR AND WHEN THE CAPACITOR GOES TO SWITCH ON IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SWITCH ON BECAUSE THAT BUG MIGHT BE BLOCKING THE MECHANICAL PORTIONS OF THAT FROM MOVING AND SIMILAR FOR THE CAPACITOR IF THERE'S A BUG OR SOME KIND OF ANIMAL IN THERE AND IT'S TOUCHING THE YOU KNOW TWO MORE POINTS OF THE CAPACITOR AND THAT CAPACITOR SWITCHES ON IT CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE THAT CAPACITOR TO SHORT OUT BECAUSE THAT OTHER ANIMAL IS ACTUALLY GIVEN A PATH BETWEEN TWO OF THE TOOL BOARD THE TERMINALS ON THE CAPACITOR SO AGAIN CLEANING OUT THE BUGS COBWEBS ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE ALSO TAKE NOTE IF THERE ARE ANY CHEWED WIRES BECAUSE IF THERE SHOOT WIRES THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE A RAT OR RODENT PROBLEM AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL HOPEFULLY YOU'VE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT AND ARE ABLE TO APPLY THIS IN THE

options that are available in CIVICRM and discuss each of them. Video Video Transcript WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANKS TO YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO AND IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION ON WORDPRESS HERE WE GO [MUSIC] ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK SO IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS VIDEO SERIES OF ME MOVING MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE PROGRESSION THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO AS FAR AS CONVERTING THE EXISTING SITE OVER IT'S A WORDPRESS MOVING CONTENT AND SO FORTH ONE FEATURE I WANT TO ADD IS TO HAVE A MAILING LIST FUNCTIONALITY ON MY WEBSITE AND SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO USE CP CRM I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING WHY DID I NOT USE LIKE A MAILCHIMP OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF SERVICE THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE I DID THINK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO WHEN YOU'RE USING THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES ONE OF WHICH IS COST SO USUALLY THERE IS A THRESHOLD OF ONCE YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU HAVE TO START PAYING ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR DATA AND SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN POINT AND SAY WELL TO PAY TO GET YOUR DATA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW SO IT'S EASIER TO COME OUT HOST YOUR OWN THINGS USING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M USING SEVERE CRM FOR THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE SO AS I DISCUSSED IN LAST VIDEO SEVERE CRM IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE SOME USE CASES FOR STUFF OUTSIDE OF A NONPROFIT ARENA ALL RIGHT SO SWITCHING OVER TO THE COMPUTER I DID INSTALL SUPER CRM IN MY LAST VIDEO SO IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THAT GO BACK AND WATCH THAT THERE WILL BE A PLAYLIST TO ALL THE VIDEOS OF THIS WEBSITE CONVERSION SERIES DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW SO WHEN YOU GO INTO CIVIC CRM FROM THE DASHBOARD THERE IS A OPTION TO DO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND SO YOU CLICK THAT IT BRINGS YOU TO A LIST OF ITEMS ON YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLED AND SO WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS WHEN I'M SETTING UP A CIVIC CRM INSTALLATION I START FROM THE TOP AND JUST WORK MY WAY DOWN AND MAKE SURE I HIT EVERY SCREEN EVEN IF I'M NOT CHANGING ANY SCREENS I JUST MAKE SURE I JUST GO DOWN A LIST AND COVER EVERYTHING BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS LIST I BUY - I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR SCREEN BUT IT'S THERE SO I'M GONNA START FROM THE TOP WE HAVE LOCALIZATION ALRIGHT AND SO HERE WE SET THE LANGUAGE I'M GONNA CHANGE THIS DEFAULT EXCUSE ME INHERITS EMS LANGUAGE WHICH IS CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - YES AND THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE WILL SET THAT AS A SITE LANGUAGE AS WELL CURRENCY I AM IN THE UNITED STATES SO I WANT TO USE USD AND I'M GONNA LEAVE THE AVAILABLE ONES - USD I'M NOT SURE HOW WILL THEN WILL CONVERT BUT YOU KNOW IF I'M USING SOME KIND OF PAYMENTS I BELIEVE PAYPAL WILL HANDLE THAT PRETTY WELL SO NO CONCERN IS THERE MY DEFAULT COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES SO I'M GOING TO SET THAT THERE AND THE DEFAULT PROVINCE I BELIEVE THAT ONE BLANK FOR THE CONTACT ADDRESS FIELD SO I WANT TO DO THE AVAILABLE COUNTRIES ARE CANADA AND GOING TO DO UNITED STATES OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO DO THE COUNTRY THAT YOUR HAND AND SPACE AND PROMISES YOU GOT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THOSE SO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES AND YOU'RE ABLE TO JUMP AROUND HERE BY USING THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THAT BUT LIKE I WANTED TO GO TO A COUNTRY THAT STARTED WITH L I JUST TYPE SELECT AND CHECK IN THE BOX AND THEN HIT L ON THE KEYBOARD AND YOU CAN EVEN TYPE OUT THE NAME IN HERE AND IT'LL JUMP DOWN TO THAT ALRIGHT AND ENABLE MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I WILL IN DUE TIME BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING IS THE ORGANIZATION ADDRESS AND CONTACT INFORMATION SO THIS IS LIKE I SAY IT IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS THE OXYGENATOR OKAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR LIKE YOU KNOW BUILT BUSINESSES THAT I'M SORRY I'LL PUT THE WRONG THING THERE ONCE YOU PUT A MAIN STREET HERE AND A CITY AND MAKE UP A ZIP CODE AND THERE ARE NO COUNTIES FOR THE UNITED STATES I DON'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY HAS CREATED A COMPONENT FOR THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE COUNTIES FOR OTHER LOCATIONS MORE SO OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE I AM THIS WILL BE BLANK AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE ORGANIZATION CONTACT INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW EMAIL ADDRESS EAR AND IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION PUT THAT IN THERE AND SO THAT INFORMATION WILL ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN THE EMAILS THAT YOU SEND OUT ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST IS THE ENABLE CIVIC CRM COMPONENTS I AM ONLY GOING TO BE USING MAIL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS EVENTS GRANTS PLEDGES CASES REPORTS AND CAMPAIGNS I WON'T ELABORATE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BEANS IN THEIR FUNCTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO TO SEE PCRM ORG AND READ UP ON THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THERE ABOUT THAT SO I'M ONLY USING MAIL AND REPORT SO I'M GONNA JUST GO AHEAD AND SAVE ALL RIGHT AND SO REGISTER YOUR SITE SO CIVIC CRM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THEIR MODULE OR SO SO YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE MAILING LISTS AND THAT THEY NOTIFY YOU OF WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING I'VE ALREADY DONE IT SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU IT TAKES YOU THROUGH THEIR SITE AND IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU THERE ALL RIGHT THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY PREFERENCES AND SO WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FIELDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WELL AS TABS I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M GOING TO UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING SO LIKE CONTRIBUTIONS MEMBERSHIPS TAGS I'LL LEAVE THAT CHECK EVENTS CASES GRANTS PLEDGES I'M NOT USING I WILL LEAVE MAILINGS CHECKED AS WELL AND SO THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT WHEN YOU ARE EDITING A CONTACT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF FIELDS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED I'M GONNA LEAVE THOSE SELECTED FOR NOW I MAY CHANGE IT AT A LATER POINT WHEN GOING TO DO A SEARCH FOR A CONTACT YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF CRITERIA HERE THAT YOU SEE I LIKE I SAID I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING THIS RELATES TO THE CONTACT SEARCH AND THE CONTACT DASHBOARD AGAIN I'M GOING TO UNCHECK SOME OF THIS STUFF HERE BECAUSE I AM NOT USING IT ALL RIGHT CIVIC CRM ALSO DOES HAVE A WYSIWYG EDITOR BUILT INTO IT THAT'S JUST SELECTING SETTING THAT AND THE DISPLAY NAME OF EACH PERSON IS ALREADY CONFIGURED IN HERE BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I BELIEVE THE THEME THE WAY IT IS YOU CAN SET IT TO A DIFFERENT THING BUT LEAVE IT AS IS ALRIGHT NEXT IS ADDRESS SETTINGS AND SO IT HAS THE ADDRESS AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULTED TO THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT OTHER DETAILS IN HERE USING THESE TOKENS OR TAKE THESE SOME OF THESE DETAILS OUT I AM GOING TO UNCHECK LATITUDE BECAUSE I HAVE NO NEED FOR LATITUDE AND I'LL LEAVE I'LL UNCHECK COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRACKING THE COUNTY IN HERE AND IF YOU WANT TO USE A ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION PROVIDER YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN YOUR CREDENTIALS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM THEM THIS LINK HERE WILL TAKE YOU THERE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SETTING THAT PART UP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT SO I'MA LEAVE IT BLANK NEXT IS MAPPING IN GEOCODING SO IF YOU'RE TRACKING ADDRESSES YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THESE MAPPING PROVIDERS HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THE SETUP IT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A KEY AND YOU CAN PUT THAT KEY IN HERE AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING THOSE ADDRESSES YOU CAN PULL UP THAT CONTACTS INFORMATION HERE AND IT WILL SHOW YOU ON A MAP WHERE THAT ADDRESS THAT THAT CONTACT HAS IS LOCATED IN THE WORLD AGAIN I'M NOT USING THAT IT'S JUST I'M ONLY DOING SENDING OUT EMAILS FROM HERE NEXT IS THE SEARCH PREFERENCES SO PRETTY MUCH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY IN HERE I NEED TO CHANGE SO ALL OF THE DEFAULTS ARE FINE BUT BASICALLY THIS ICON UP HERE IS SEARCHES AND YOU CAN CHANGE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR JUST BY SELECTING IT ALL RIGHT SO NICKNAMED A PAGE ORDER QUICK SEARCH OPTIONS I'LL LEAVE THOSE AS IS AND TIM RESULTS ALL RIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUST SAVE IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING I ALWAYS MAKE IT A HABIT OF WHEN I EXIT OUT TO SAVE JUST IN CASE I DO CHANGE SOMETHING THEY FORGET ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ONE IS THE MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS SO CONTRACT CONTACT TRASH AND UNDELETE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT AT YES THAT WAY IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY DELETE SOMETHING YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TRASH AND RESTORE IT DON'T NEED TO DO ANY LOGGING AND I DON'T WANT TO ATTACH PDFS TO THE RECEIPTS THAT MAKE YOUR EMAILS UNNECESSARILY BIGGER AND ALSO MORE LOAD ON YOUR

GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANKS TO YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO AND IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION ON WORDPRESS HERE WE GO [MUSIC] ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK SO IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS VIDEO SERIES OF ME MOVING MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE PROGRESSION THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO AS FAR AS CONVERTING THE EXISTING SITE OVER IT'S A WORDPRESS MOVING CONTENT AND SO FORTH ONE FEATURE I WANT TO ADD IS TO HAVE A MAILING LIST FUNCTIONALITY ON MY WEBSITE AND SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO USE CP CRM I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING WHY DID I NOT USE LIKE A MAILCHIMP OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF SERVICE THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE I DID THINK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO WHEN YOU'RE USING THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES ONE OF WHICH IS COST SO USUALLY THERE IS A THRESHOLD OF ONCE YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU HAVE TO START PAYING ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR DATA AND SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN POINT AND SAY WELL TO PAY TO GET YOUR DATA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW SO IT'S EASIER TO COME OUT HOST YOUR OWN THINGS USING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M USING SEVERE CRM FOR THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE SO AS I DISCUSSED IN LAST VIDEO SEVERE CRM IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE SOME USE CASES FOR STUFF OUTSIDE OF A NONPROFIT ARENA ALL RIGHT SO SWITCHING OVER TO THE COMPUTER I DID INSTALL SUPER CRM IN MY LAST VIDEO SO IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THAT GO BACK AND WATCH THAT THERE WILL BE A PLAYLIST TO ALL THE VIDEOS OF THIS WEBSITE CONVERSION SERIES DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW SO WHEN YOU GO INTO CIVIC CRM FROM THE DASHBOARD THERE IS A OPTION TO DO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND SO YOU CLICK THAT IT BRINGS YOU TO A LIST OF ITEMS ON YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLED AND SO WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS WHEN I'M SETTING UP A CIVIC CRM INSTALLATION I START FROM THE TOP AND JUST WORK MY WAY DOWN AND MAKE SURE I HIT EVERY SCREEN EVEN IF I'M NOT CHANGING ANY SCREENS I JUST MAKE SURE I JUST GO DOWN A LIST AND COVER EVERYTHING BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS LIST I BUY - I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR SCREEN BUT IT'S THERE SO I'M GONNA START FROM THE TOP WE HAVE LOCALIZATION ALRIGHT AND SO HERE WE SET THE LANGUAGE I'M GONNA CHANGE THIS DEFAULT EXCUSE ME INHERITS EMS LANGUAGE WHICH IS CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - YES AND THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE WILL SET THAT AS A SITE LANGUAGE AS WELL CURRENCY I AM IN THE UNITED STATES SO I WANT TO USE USD AND I'M GONNA LEAVE THE AVAILABLE ONES - USD I'M NOT SURE HOW WILL THEN WILL CONVERT BUT YOU KNOW IF I'M USING SOME KIND OF PAYMENTS I BELIEVE PAYPAL WILL HANDLE THAT PRETTY WELL SO NO CONCERN IS THERE MY DEFAULT COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES SO I'M GOING TO SET THAT THERE AND THE DEFAULT PROVINCE I BELIEVE THAT ONE BLANK FOR THE CONTACT ADDRESS FIELD SO I WANT TO DO THE AVAILABLE COUNTRIES ARE CANADA AND GOING TO DO UNITED STATES OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO DO THE COUNTRY THAT YOUR HAND AND SPACE AND PROMISES YOU GOT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THOSE SO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES AND YOU'RE ABLE TO JUMP AROUND HERE BY USING THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THAT BUT LIKE I WANTED TO GO TO A COUNTRY THAT STARTED WITH L I JUST TYPE SELECT AND CHECK IN THE BOX AND THEN HIT L ON THE KEYBOARD AND YOU CAN EVEN TYPE OUT THE NAME IN HERE AND IT'LL JUMP DOWN TO THAT ALRIGHT AND ENABLE MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I WILL IN DUE TIME BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING IS THE ORGANIZATION ADDRESS AND CONTACT INFORMATION SO THIS IS LIKE I SAY IT IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS THE OXYGENATOR OKAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR LIKE YOU KNOW BUILT BUSINESSES THAT I'M SORRY I'LL PUT THE WRONG THING THERE ONCE YOU PUT A MAIN STREET HERE AND A CITY AND MAKE UP A ZIP CODE AND THERE ARE NO COUNTIES FOR THE UNITED STATES I DON'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY HAS CREATED A COMPONENT FOR THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE COUNTIES FOR OTHER LOCATIONS MORE SO OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE I AM THIS WILL BE BLANK AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE ORGANIZATION CONTACT INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW EMAIL ADDRESS EAR AND IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION PUT THAT IN THERE AND SO THAT INFORMATION WILL ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN THE EMAILS THAT YOU SEND OUT ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST IS THE ENABLE CIVIC CRM COMPONENTS I AM ONLY GOING TO BE USING MAIL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS EVENTS GRANTS PLEDGES CASES REPORTS AND CAMPAIGNS I WON'T ELABORATE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BEANS IN THEIR FUNCTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO TO SEE PCRM ORG AND READ UP ON THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THERE ABOUT THAT SO I'M ONLY USING MAIL AND REPORT SO I'M GONNA JUST GO AHEAD AND SAVE ALL RIGHT AND SO REGISTER YOUR SITE SO CIVIC CRM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THEIR MODULE OR SO SO YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE MAILING LISTS AND THAT THEY NOTIFY YOU OF WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING I'VE ALREADY DONE IT SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU IT TAKES YOU THROUGH THEIR SITE AND IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU THERE ALL RIGHT THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY PREFERENCES AND SO WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FIELDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WELL AS TABS I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M GOING TO UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING SO LIKE CONTRIBUTIONS MEMBERSHIPS TAGS I'LL LEAVE THAT CHECK EVENTS CASES GRANTS PLEDGES I'M NOT USING I WILL LEAVE MAILINGS CHECKED AS WELL AND SO THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT WHEN YOU ARE EDITING A CONTACT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF FIELDS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED I'M GONNA LEAVE THOSE SELECTED FOR NOW I MAY CHANGE IT AT A LATER POINT WHEN GOING TO DO A SEARCH FOR A CONTACT YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF CRITERIA HERE THAT YOU SEE I LIKE I SAID I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING THIS RELATES TO THE CONTACT SEARCH AND THE CONTACT DASHBOARD AGAIN I'M GOING TO UNCHECK SOME OF THIS STUFF HERE BECAUSE I AM NOT USING IT ALL RIGHT CIVIC CRM ALSO DOES HAVE A WYSIWYG EDITOR BUILT INTO IT THAT'S JUST SELECTING SETTING THAT AND THE DISPLAY NAME OF EACH PERSON IS ALREADY CONFIGURED IN HERE BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I BELIEVE THE THEME THE WAY IT IS YOU CAN SET IT TO A DIFFERENT THING BUT LEAVE IT AS IS ALRIGHT NEXT IS ADDRESS SETTINGS AND SO IT HAS THE ADDRESS AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULTED TO THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT OTHER DETAILS IN HERE USING THESE TOKENS OR TAKE THESE SOME OF THESE DETAILS OUT I AM GOING TO UNCHECK LATITUDE BECAUSE I HAVE NO NEED FOR LATITUDE AND I'LL LEAVE I'LL UNCHECK COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRACKING THE COUNTY IN HERE AND IF YOU WANT TO USE A ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION PROVIDER YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN YOUR CREDENTIALS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM THEM THIS LINK HERE WILL TAKE YOU THERE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SETTING THAT PART UP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT SO I'MA LEAVE IT BLANK NEXT IS MAPPING IN GEOCODING SO IF YOU'RE TRACKING ADDRESSES YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THESE MAPPING PROVIDERS HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THE SETUP IT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A KEY AND YOU CAN PUT THAT KEY IN HERE AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING THOSE ADDRESSES YOU CAN PULL UP THAT CONTACTS INFORMATION HERE AND IT WILL SHOW YOU ON A MAP WHERE THAT ADDRESS THAT THAT CONTACT HAS IS LOCATED IN THE WORLD AGAIN I'M NOT USING THAT IT'S JUST I'M ONLY DOING SENDING OUT EMAILS FROM HERE NEXT IS THE SEARCH PREFERENCES SO PRETTY MUCH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY IN HERE I NEED TO CHANGE SO ALL OF THE DEFAULTS ARE FINE BUT BASICALLY THIS ICON UP HERE IS SEARCHES AND YOU CAN CHANGE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR JUST BY SELECTING IT ALL RIGHT SO NICKNAMED A PAGE ORDER QUICK SEARCH OPTIONS I'LL LEAVE THOSE AS IS AND TIM RESULTS ALL RIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUST SAVE IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING I ALWAYS MAKE IT A HABIT OF WHEN I EXIT OUT TO SAVE JUST IN CASE I DO CHANGE SOMETHING THEY FORGET ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ONE IS THE MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS SO CONTRACT CONTACT TRASH AND UNDELETE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT AT YES THAT WAY IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY DELETE SOMETHING YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TRASH AND RESTORE IT DON'T NEED TO DO ANY LOGGING AND I DON'T WANT TO ATTACH PDFS TO THE RECEIPTS THAT MAKE YOUR EMAILS UNNECESSARILY BIGGER AND ALSO MORE LOAD ON YOUR SERVER IF YOU'RE GENERATING LETTERS LIKE IN BATCHES YOU CAN HAVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE THAT HERE I'D RATHER HAVE ONE PER CONTACT SO THAT'S FINE AND THESE ARE OTHER SETTINGS RELATED TO VARIOUS THINGS LIKE SENDING EMAILS AND SO FORTH AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS RECAPTCHA ON HERE IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THAT IT WILL BETTER PROTECT THE FORMS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR SITE OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE AN ERROR HERE SO I BELIEVE MY MAX PHP AND MY EXCUSE ME MAX UPLOAD SIZE AND MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS SET TO 2 MEGABYTES SO I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I ORIGINALLY HAD 3 HERE WHICH WAS THE DEFAULT ALL RIGHT SO NEXT IS THE CONTACT TYPES SO BY DEFAULT THERE ARE THREE CONTENT TYPES BUILT-IN ORGANIZATION HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL DEPENDING ON YOUR USE CASE YOU CAN TURN THESE OFF AND AND OR AB OR OR DELETE THESE THAT ARE HERE FOR RIGHT

RIGHT AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT A DESCRIPTION IN HERE YOU CAN ORDER AND WHETHER IT'S THE DEFAULT OPTION ALRIGHT SO THAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA GO BACK THIS TIME TO THAT CHECKLIST BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT SAVE ME TO THE WRONG PLACE OKAY ALL RIGHT OUTBOUND EMAIL SO HERE IS WHERE YOU WOULD SET WHETHER TO SEND EMAIL USING SMTP SO IF YOU'RE WANTING TO USE A GMAIL ADDRESS YOU CAN USE THE SMTP

your system to run to certain intervals. Otherwise you have to manually run these task which will increase your manual workload. In this video, I show you how to set up this automated process. Video Video Transcript AS PART OF THE CONVERSION OF MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS I ALSO INSTALLED CIVI CRM AND SO SYMPATHY RM REQUIRES A CRON TASK OR A ROUTINE SCHEDULER THAT KICKS OFF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE PROCESSES WHETHER HOURLY OR DAILY AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE A SHELL SCRIPT AS WELL AS DOWNLOADED THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TOOL THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO ALL OF THAT SO I'M GOING TO COVER THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS VIDEO WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO ONCE AGAIN SO HERE WE HAVE THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I CREATED FOR RUNNING CIVI CRM CRIME AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN SUPER CRM YOU HAVE A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE PROCESSES THERE PREFER TO AS SCHEDULED TASKS AND THE SYSTEM EXCUSE ME SCHEDULED JOBS AND SO I'M GOING TO ADMINISTER SYSTEM SETTINGS AND SCHEDULED JOBS WILL BRING YOU TO THIS PAGE AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS TASKS SUCH AS CLEANING IT UP TEMPORARY DATA CHECKING FOR UPDATES CHECKING EMAILS WHETHER IT'S PROCESSING EMAILS OR FETCHING EMAILS THAT HAVE BOUNCED FROM YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SO THEY RUN AT VARIOUS INTERVALS AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CIVI CRM REQUIRES THAT YOU SET UP A TASK SCHEDULER OR A CRON JOB AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT THAT COULD BE DONE USING THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE TOOL AND SO IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CIVI CRM WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS CV DOT FAR FILE OR CAR I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PH IS FAR FAR FAR AWAY AND SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN VARIOUS THINGS IN CIVI CRM AND PERFORM VARIOUS ACTIONS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE THE WP COMMAND LINE OR WORDPRESS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO RUN IT AND IT GIVES YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO IF YOU RUN IT LIKE I JUST DID HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN PHP AND THEN PASS THE FILE NAME AS A ARGUMENT TO THE PHP CALL BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY A PHP SCRIPT OF SORTS AND SO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE YOU CAN MAKE CALL TO THE APIS YOU CAN CALL THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS HERE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RUN THE CRIME PROCESS AND SO I HAVE THAT POOL OF DUCK AND SO HERE IS THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I HAVE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION YOU CAN GO TO THE REPOSITORY FOR MY WEBSITE I HAVE A LINK TO THE POSIT OR E DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW AND YOU CAN MAKE A COPY OF THIS SCRIPT AND SO BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHECKS IT STARTS OFF WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THIS URL PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I GOT THE CONCEPT OF HOW TO BUILD THIS SCRIPT OUT BUT IT STARTS WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THE REASON I PUT THE CURRENT DATE IN HERE IS SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN IT STARTED AND WHEN THEY END IT I'LL PROBABLY MAKE SOME MORE ADJUSTMENT TO THIS BEFORE ACTUALLY ROLLING IT OUT TO MY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ARGUMENT ONE IS NOT EMPTY AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE ARGUMENT 1 IS GOING TO BE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY OF WHERE THIS WHERE YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE WORDPRESS IS ON THE FILE SYSTEM IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO FROM THERE DOWN INTO THE FILE SYSTEM TO THE CIVIC CRM STUFF TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE NECESSARY COMMANDS THAT IT HAS TO RUN AND SO WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES IT JUST PRINTS OUT THE PATH THAT WAS PASSED IN AS ARGUMENT 1 TO THE SCRIPT AND THEN YOU CALL THEM PHP AND THEN THE CB DOT FARM FILE AND THEN THE NEXT PART IS YOU'RE MAKING AN API CALL TO DO JOB EXECUTE AND YOU WANT TO RUN THAT JOB EXECUTION AS USER CRON CIVI THIS USER WILL DEPEND ON HOW YOU HAVE YOUR SETUP BUT YOU NEED TO CREATE A USER ACCOUNT THAT WILL BE USED TO RUN THE CRON JOBS AND THEN YOU NEED TO SET THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE LOCATION THAT YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS LOCATED ON THE FILESYSTEM AND SO IF YOU DON'T PASS IN THIS DOLLAR ONE IT THROWS AN ERROR BASICALLY SAYING YOU NEED TO RUN IT AND I ACTUALLY NEED TO UPDATE THE SCRIPT NAME BECAUSE I HAVE CHANGED IT BUT BASICALLY THE SCRIPT NAME AND THEN THE FOLDER ROOT WHERE FOLDER ROOT IS THE TOP LEVEL OF YOUR WORDPRESS PROJECT AND THEN THAT IS IT AND SO WHAT YOU DO RUN THIS AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND RUN IT FOR YOU NOW ALL RIGHT SO GOING TO DO DOT OR I CAN DO BASH EITHER WAY WORKS BECAUSE IT IS A BASH SCRIPT AND SO IS CIVI CRON EXCUSE ME CBC REM UNDERSCORE CRON DOT S H AND THEN I AM GOING TO DO THE PATH TO MY WORDPRESS DIRECTORY WHICH IT IS AND MY HOME AND SO I HIT ENTER AND YOU GET THIS OUTPUT AFTERWARDS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS THE START DATE AND TIME IT'S THE END DATE AND TIME THIS IS THE PATH LOCATION THAT I PASSED IN AND THIS SECTION RIGHT HERE IS THE JSON API RESPONSE THAT CIVI CRM HAS RETURNED BACK AND IF YOU GET A IS ERROR IS EQUAL TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN ZERO THAT MEANS SOMETHING DID NOT GO RIGHT AND YOU'LL NEED TO CHECK UP BE LOGS USUALLY IF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUTPUT THAN THESE LINES THAT IT DID RETURN THE LOG ERROR WILL SHOW UP IN CBC RM SO YOU COULD JUST LOG INTO SAVVY CRM AND LOOK IT'S THERE TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE SO THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THAT PART OF THINGS AND THEN THE LAST THING IS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO RUN THIS SHELL SCRIPT BEING A CRONTAB OR SCHEDULER TASK SO NOW I WILL COVER THAT PARTICULAR PART SO ON MY SYSTEM I HAVE CRONTAB SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN THAT UP AND AS YOU SEE I HAVE THE SECOND ITEM HERE WHICH RUNS THAT CIVICRM CRON SCRIPT AND I HAVE IT RUNNING EVERY 15 MINUTES HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IT RUN IN 15 MINUTES AT A MINIMUM I WOULD SUGGEST YOU RUN IT EVERY HOUR BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME HOURLY TASKS IN THERE THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED AND THAT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME OF TRAFFIC ON YOUR WEBSITE IF YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF VOLUME HOUR IS DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VOLUME YOU COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH 2 OR 3 OR EVEN 12 HOURS FOR THE FREQUENCY AND SO BASICALLY IT IS THE SAME COMMAND THAT I RAN SO I AM USING THE FULL PATH TO THE EXECUTABLES AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU START A CRON JOB DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM IT STARTS IN THE ROOT OF THE FILE SYSTEM IT MAY START IN THE HOME OF THE USER THAT IS RUNNING THAT CRON JOB IT ALL DEPENDS SO TO BE VERY EXPLICIT USE THE FULL PATH BECAUSE DEPEND ON WHERE IT STARTS IT MAY OR MAY NOT LOAD THAT RC FILE AND THE PATH VARIABLE WHICH WILL HAVE THE REFERENCE TO /BIN ALREADY POPULATED SO THAT'S WHY IN THE COMMAND LINE YOU CAN TYPE BASH AND IT KNOWS BIN BASH BUT IN CRON IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY LOAD THAT SO YOU IT'S BEST TO TYPE THE FULL THING SO IT'S NOT GUESSING AND SO GIVING THE FULL PATH TO THE SHOW SCRIPT AND THEN I'M GIVING THE FULL PATH TO THAT DIRECTORY AND THEN I AM OUTPUTTING ALL OF THE RESULTS FROM THE COMMAND THAT'S BEING RAN INTO A LOG FILE THAT IS IN MY HOME DIRECTORY AND THEN I'M COMBINING ANY ERRORS INTO THE STANDARD OUT AND ALL THAT GOES INTO THAT SAME LOG FILE THAT WAY I DON'T HAVE TWO FILES THAT I HAVE TO CHECK IT'S EVERYTHING IS IN ONE FILE AND IT'S IN THE ORDER THAT IT OCCURRED AND SO I WILL ALSO SHOW YOU THIS LONG VOWEL SO GO HERE AND DO CATS BECAUSE THE CONTENTS ARE NOT THAT LONG AND SO HERE YOU SEE WE HAVE THE SAME THING FROM WHEN I RAN IT ON THE COMMAND LINE DATE THE PATH AND THE JSON RESPONSE AND THEN THE END DATE AND TIME SO THAT WILL WRAP IT UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO IF YOU NEED HELP SETTING UP YOUR CRON JOB ON CBC RM FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER YOU CAN ALSO REACH OUT DOWN BELOW BY LEAVING A COMMENT WITH WHATEVER ISSUE THAT YOU'RE HAVING AND I'LL BE SURE TO RESPOND BACK TO YOU WITH ANY ADVICE OR SUGGESTIONS

it. I discuss the parts of a contactor and how it works. Check out the video! Video Video Transcript what's going on fellow engineers this is Kenny and thanks for checking out the Almost Engineer Channel and in this video I'm going to talk about a contactor this thing right here and how it works stay tuned [Music] alright so this is the contactor that I took off of my HVAC unit and this is the old one so I just wanted to talk about what a contactor is and what it does and how it works and so there are some elements on here that are not exactly right with a modern contactor this one is probably original to the HVAC unit that I have so there are some differences that I notice between the new one and the old one alright folks so I got my new contactor which is this one over here and my old contactor which is this one here for the most part they are pretty much the same the screw on this one actually I had to screw it all the way out to get the lead out of there so but there are some significant differences that I'm noticing so on the top of this one actually you stick the wire in whereas this one had a clamp that you put a connector on it and then you put that connector around the screw head so the top is essentially like the bottom now where you stick the whole wire in and then you screw to clamp it down all the way also the same number of pins here looks to be there's eight on the bottom and there's eight on the top here I only had I believe it was two wires here and this one also is enclosed so as you can see you can see the coil on this one both sides so but you can on this one and the reason being is somebody actually took the counts that hey bugs can actually get into this thing and cause problems so what they do now is they actually seal it up entirely so all this mechanical stuff like this right here is not exposed to the elements however you can take these two screws off and this play to come up and then it will look just like this inside underneath this cover here so that's the difference between the new contactor and the old contactor and so with this particular contactor unit so we'll start off with the label of course and here you'll see is rated for 25 amps and it's also a 24 volt coil and so the contactor that I put on is actually rated for 30 amps but it's also 24 volts and so what the amperage has to do is that it has a maximum capacity you know you see it as 25 so if you try to push 30 through it more likely you'll have a problem and I think that kind of helped in some cases the failure of this one and so if you see right here where this screw is you'll see this plastic here is actually burned and cracked it actually broke off what happened there was it looks like the wire on it actually broke burned some kind of way I don't know if something got into it and caused it to short out or what the case was but this is the connector that was on it after the fact from the wire way it burned off at so and as you see this screw is actually brown so I don't know if that is the indicator of the problem that was going on with it because it should not have been brown it should be fight the rest of these you know silver we're not so just a walk overview of everything so on the bottom here have pins you can have these push connectors that go on these pins here at the bottom then you also have these two terminal screws and so you can stick the wire in this gap here tighten the screw down same thing on this side and then on the top it's a different setup because they actually use these connectors that go over the screw and then you tighten screw down on the connector instead of sticking the wire directly in so that's that side and this is what is known as a single pole breaker and there's also a thing called a double pole breaker so the pole is the thing that actually moves so this one here is not seized up it does move but it only has one pole which is this side so this right side here as you see there's a metal bar that goes from top to bottom that means this side is always hot this side is the side that switches so we turn on the AC U and it this goes in and it connects the bottom which is where the power comes in that to the top which is where it goes out to the compressor and the fan on the condenser unit and completes the circuit so sue Evans so fan is running but there's no I don't hear the compressor running too and so that's how that works now how does this move back and forth well on this side and on this side you have these two connectors as well these since this is a 24 volt coil these connect to the 24 volt wires that come from the inner handler that is on the building interior so when there is a call for cooling the thermostat connects the wires inside of it and that signal goes to the air handler the air handler triggers that same since that signal out to the condenser through one side and then back out the other therefore you complete the circuit and when you complete the circuit on here this pushes in and completes the 240 circuit so if you ever heard me discuss about relays before this is essentially the same concept as a relay you have a voltage of one type in this case would be in 24 volts controlling a voltage of a higher type which in this case is 240 volts that's 120 on the Left 120 on the right which equals 240 now this one may or may not say it I do not believe it does but it is designed for 240 but it doesn't say it the unit itself says 240 the actual conditioner unit says 240 on it so and then once you remove the 24 volts so the thermostat says hey I've reached the set temperature shut off so that means the thermostat disconnects the connection between the air handler and it and so as a result that same connection is also removed so the incoming 24 volts is removed from here and thus there's nothing on this side to go back so this connector in the middle here will spring up and there is a spring underneath it as you can kind of see right there there's a spring there and so that comes back up to disconnect the connector connection between the top of the bottom so that covers how a contactor works hopefully you've learned a little bit and are able to apply this in the future if you have any questions about the contactor or relay please hit me up and drop a comment in the comment section below also please check out me on social media on Instagram and Twitter at almost Engr and check out my website the

found files that I had from college. Some of these files were from the classes that I took. Some are from the classes that others took and I helped them with their coursework. I figured I would share this code online for several reasons. I outline these reasons below and provide a warning for students that are currently in college. Reason 1: Reference Material When you get started in your career after college, sometimes you may want to refer to those programs or code that you wrote in college. Sometimes the code or components that I used, like a regular expression that validates email addresses that I used in my MIS 320 Application Design class, still works today. I will be honest, I have never sourced that expression from my old code, but I do remember it being there and could use it if I needed to. Reason 2: See Your Growth In order to see how much you have improved in your skills, you need to have evidence of what you previously did ( see Reason 1 ). By saving my work from when I was in college, I am now able to see how I previously wrote code. When I was in college, Visual Basic and C++ were the primary languages being taught. As I am writing this post in 2020, the primary languages that are being used are C#, Python, Java, and Python. If you are writing new code in Visual Basic, you will probably get laughed at or questioned unless you are writing a macro for a Microsoft Office program or something similar. Technology Shift As you can see, what were the primary languages circa 2010 and what they are circa 2020, have changed. This change is in part, has been because technology has moved towards using more web-based applications instead of desktop applications, increased use of technology on mobile devices, and designing applications and websites that work on multiple platforms. Reason 3: Portfolio Once you get close to graduation, you will begin to look for a job in your field. More and more employers are more concerned with the work experience that you have instead of your GPA or the institution that you attended. Why is the case? In some schools, it is easy to cheat and pass a class. While cheating can get you suspended or expelled (there were some in my classes that did get caught), learning how the tools used to detect cheating can be scapegoated. Long story short, you can pass a class and not learn anything from said class. When you talk about your experience, sometimes they will ask to see your work. As I have previously conducted interviews in the past, the reason that the interviewer wants to see your existing code or to write out code in an interview, is not necessarily to see if you will get the coding problem correct. It is to see how you think and whether you understand coding design patterns. Why Not Focus on Getting Coding Problems Right? There are many ways to write code. For example, in C# (C-Sharp), which of the following code blocks is correctly written? int x = 1; Figure 1 int x; x = 1; Figure 2 Some would say that both are correct because they do the same thing. Figure 2 takes more steps to accomplish the same task. Some would say that Figure 1 is correct because the code is more concise. In my opinion, they are both correct for the reasons stated. However, if you are following design patterns and principles like SOLID and DRY, you would know that Figure 1 is the best way of writing this code. Experience vs. Grades Please do not mistaken what I mean when I say that experience is more important than grades. That does not mean that you can fail your classes and still be successful. While grades do not necessarily reflect ones skill set (because of built in biases in exams and curriculum), they do reflect the level of commitment that an individual had during their collegiate tenure. Experience is valued more because you have demonstrated your knowledge in a given subject. What are examples of experience that you can gain? Interships Both paid and not paid count. This will give you the least experience points because they are only done for short amounts of time (usually during the summer). Co-op . This is a program where the college or university partner with a company that allow you get on the job training and work while enrolled in school. This offers you greater experience points in my opinion as you usually work for an entire year full time (alternating school semesters). Running a business Want to build websites for a living? Then starting a business doing that is the best way to gain experience. The involvement required to run a business, will earn you way more experience points of all because you have to have multiple skillsets to run a business. Word of Caution If you are currently enrolled in school, I would not suggest that you post the code that you are working on online until after the end of the semester or school year. Why not? I have ran across some Reddits and forums that mention how some students posted their homework online. Then one of their classmates did a search and was able to find it, copy it, and turn it in. It was all downhill from there. Online Situation In one instance, the original writer of the code posted asking what he should do about his situation. The teacher ran the code through a plagiarism tool. This tool compares your code to the code of other students and provides a match percentage of duplication. This is a common practice with schools that have large number of students taking Computer Science courses. In this scenario, it flagged the code of this and another student's as they were exactly the same. This resulted disciplinary action being given to the original writer of the code as he submitted his assignment after plagiarizer. However, the date and timestamps on GitHub, showed that he had wrote and committed the code before the plagiarizer had submitted his homework. I do not know how this situation ended. However, it could have been avoided by the original writer not posting his code online until after the assignment due date had passed. Personal Experience - MIS 320 In this class , we had an assignment that involved Javascript . Mind you, most of the class had never seen Javascript, let alone understood the syntax for it because we were taught Visual Basic throughout most of our collegiate career. That being said, a group of students spent one night in the computer lab trying to get the assignment completed. From what I recall, one person in the lab managed to figure out how to complete the assignment. Then shared it with the other students who were in the lab. They submitted the homework for grading. After the assignments were graded, the teacher made an announcement in class that a number of the assignments looked very similar (translation: looked plagiarized) and that if it happens again, he would be submitting the students' names to the Dean's Office for Academic Misconduct violations. Conviction of academic misconduct could suspension or expulsion. After that announcement, there were no more instances of that happening in that class. Personal Experience - CS 375 In this course , there was a similar incident to the above that took place. We had a homework assignment that was to be completed individually. One of the classmates, whom I also worked with at the university's IT department, was in the same class. The entire class managed to struggle with this assignment, so most turned in what they had working as we were told to turn in what we did have working and we would at least get some credit for the parts that did work. This student managed to get it fully working and shared it with some of the classmates that he sat near. That was big mistake as his code matched 2-3 other students in the class (the ones that he sat near or was friends with). The teacher immediately reported this Academic Misconduct to the dean's office in addition to making an announcement in class about the infraction and the action that had been taken. From what I recall, the student that provided the code was immediately suspended and lost his job (as he was a student employee, but no longer a student), and the other students that plagiarized the code were forced to drop the class (thus impacting their GPA and possibly delaying their graduation). In addition, all the students involved, have the Academic Misconduct on their collegiate records. Conclusion Putting your code online further validates that you have experience in the IT (Information Technology) industry. Furthermore, if perspective employers want to see your work, they can do so at their leisure. However, posting your code too soon, can result in your career path being altered in a way that you would least expect. I am not sure if my perspective employers looked at my GitHub repos when considering me for a job. However, I do provide this information to further backup my claim and discussions of my past programming and technology experience. Even putting code snippets online will help you out as they can be searched and used by yourself and others.

The only problem was that the customer had not received the chair. It was scheduled to be delivered on the same day that I was scheduled to assemble it, but that did not happen. I advised the customer to contact Customer Service and let them know of the issue. While the customer was waiting on hold, she asked me what did I do for a living. I told her that I assemble furniture and other handyman work part-time and work full-time in IT (Information Technology). Her eyes got real big and she asked if I could take a look at her printer once she got done with the call and I agreed. The Setup The customer had a laptop with Windows 10 and a HP Deskjet 2600 Series printer. This particular printer is designed to be connected to Wifi, but uses USB connection for the initial setup. She previously had another HP printer, but replaced it with the Deskjet 2600 one. She said that she had got it working at one point, but that it had stopped working and she was not sure why. Here are the various tasks that I did in order to get them working. I do not remember the exact order that they were done it, but I want to provide you with a checklist in case you run into the same issue. Reinstall Printer Drivers or Software First thing was to reinstall the printer drivers. The user already had the HP Printer Toolbox installed on the computer. It had the printer already configured in it like I previously mentioned. However, even a print test page would not print from the software. I performed the setup several times. The way that you have to set this printer up is to Install the HP software on your computer Connect the printer to the computer via USB cable Run the HP software setup configuration. This will ask you for the wireless settings to use and whether the device is on the network. Disconnect the USB cable Then the software will try to find the printer via the network. If it does not find it, then it will complain and ask that you try the setup again. This did not work for the probably 5 times that I tried it. Thus I figured I would check something else, which was the network itself. Assign A Static IP Address This printer connects to the network via Wifi. If you are familiar with how DHCP and the assigning of IP addresses work, then you can probably skip this section. For those of you that are not, continue reading. HP printers can print out a status sheet. This sheet includes everything from the IP address, software version, model number, ink or toner level and more. Often times, it prints all of this information on more than one sheet of paper (in this case printed 3 pages and was still going before I cancelled the print job). The customer had previously printed out one of the pages. On this print out, it had the IP address as 192.168.1.3. However, on the computer, one of the screens showed that it had the IP address mapped to 192.168.1.4. For those of you that are not familiar with IP addresses, this would be the equivalent of somebody giving you the address to a place, and everything in the address is correct but the house number. Thus resulting in you ending up at the wrong destination. Since the IP address changed between installation and usage, the computer was sending the print job to a device that was not on the network at the address specified (i.e. nobody was home). What I did was to go in the customer's router and assign the printer a static IP address. That way every time the printer connects to the network, it will always have the same IP address. Print A Test Page There are more than the two ways that you can print a test page. Below are the two ways that I tried to print something when diagnosing this issue. From Control Panel From the Control Panel, you can print a test page. Go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Right on the printer > Properties > Print Test Page. I tried this several times, but it would not print the test page. I checked the printer queue and it showed that the Test Page job was being sent and queued up, but it would error out and did not really give a reason or explanation about the error. From Word or Text Editor The alternative would be to type some text into an empty Word document and try to print it. This did not work either and errored out like the print from the Control Panel. Turn It Off and Back On \"Did you try turning it off and back on again?\" People that do not work in technology or understand it really underestimate how this simple step can correct a lot of tech or electronic problems. I had restarted the printer several times and it still was not getting the print jobs. I am not sure why this was the case. Then it came to mind to restart the computer. It was a Windows computer after all and most of the time when you install software on Windows, it is best to restart to make sure all the changes are applied as some software has to do stuff after the restart completes. Did the restart and after the Desktop appeared, the Word document I had attempted to print actually started printing. It was still in the print queue when I shut the computer down. Conclusion Did a few more prints just to confirm that all was still good and everything printed correctly as it should. I share this story about the printer issues in case you are having problems with yours. The biggest takeaway from this that I would recommend is that if you have a network printer, that setting it up to have a static IP address that is assigned by the router would eliminate this headache or printer connection issues in the future.","title":"HP Wireless Printer Problems"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.19-hp-wireless-printer-problems/#background","text":"I had a job for a chair assembly for a customer.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the job downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well. 24-hour clock Bash Command echo \"<select>\" for h in {0..23}; do for m in {0..5}; do echo \"<option

realized that in my particular situation, that the values that were being returned from the database were in the 24-hour clock, but the documentation and mockups that we had for the screen that this time list was to be used on, was in the 12-hour clock. Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above. I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database. The rest of the command remained the same.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the job downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well.","title":"Background"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times/#24-hour-clock","text":"","title":"24-hour

situation, that the values that were being returned from the database were in the 24-hour clock, but the documentation and mockups that we had for the screen that this time list was to be used on, was in the 12-hour clock. Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above. I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database. The rest of the command remained the same.","title":"Bash Command"},{"location":"blog/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times/#command-output_2","text":"<select> <option value=\"12:00\">12:00 AM</option>

Declare Variables Variables hold the values that are used in your application or script. In Python, variables are not strong-typed. This means that the variables you declare, are not limited to a particular data type. However, the variable does have a value, any future changes to that value must be of the same type. So you cannot set the value of a variable to a string and then change it to a integer. myVariable = \"red\" myOtherVariable = false myOtherOtherVariable = 5 Functions To write a function in Python, you start the function out with the \"def\" keyword. Example def myFunction (param1, param2, param3): sum = param1 + param2 + param3 return sum If you notice, there are no braces or brackets around the contents of the function. Python relies on indentation for the grouping of lines together within a given section. Random Number Random nubmers can be used to do countdowns or other things that are needed. To get a random number, you have to import the randomint class from the random library by adding from random import randint to the top of your Python script. Then you can set the random integer to a variable by doing myNumber = randint(5,60) In the example above, 5 is the lower limit of the range and 60 is the upper limit of the range. If your range needs to be different, then changes either or both of these values. Basic Mathematics Addition To do addition in Python, just have to code out two numbers and add them together like you would normally do for a math problem that you were writing on paper. Just keep in mind that the calculations always have to be done on the right side of the equals sign and will be set to the variable on the left of the equals sign. sum = 5 + 3 print sum Output: 8 Subtraction Similar in fashion, subtraction is written just like addition, except it uses the minus sign instead of the plus sign. difference = 10 - 3 print difference Output: 7 Multiplication Multiplication is done using the asterisk. product = 4 * 3 print product Output: 12 Division quotient = 20 / 5 print quotient Output: 4 Hello World Below is a sample of how to print out \"Hello world\" in Python. print (\"Hello world\") Output: Hello world More Resources The Raspberry Pi traffic light project is written in Python code.
