Kenny works (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field of Computer Science, has great problem solving skills, and enjoys fixing things instead of paying someone else to do it for him. However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer. Programmer in IT (Information Technology) Kenny's day job is working as a programmer. He has years of experience in building web based applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living, often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for that code snippet and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for. Why Does Kenny Blog? Kenny has been blogging his gardening, technology experiences , and mishaps for several reasons: you learn from your past mistakes others can learn from your mistakes before they make them you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going. Blog Technology Originally, Kenny started blogging on Blogger in 2010. After several years of a having the blog there, the blog was converted to Drupal 7. At the time of this switch, Kenny was using Drupal 7 on a number of websites that Kenny was building and maintaining. So it made sense to use it for his personal use. In 2019, Kenny converted the blog again from Drupal 7 over to MkDocs. The reason for this conversion was because he found myself spending more time performing maintenance updates than writing content. He outlines this more in his post on switching from Drupal to MkDocs . Services Kenny offers custom software solutions and handyman work through my business Robinson Handy and Technology Services . To make an appointment or discuss business, please visit the website. Blogs I Read In addition to writing here, Kenny also reads the blogs of others. Before you ask, they do not provide any kickbacks or monetary support for him listing links to their blog. Tech related blogs and resources can be found on the Resources page.

Low and slow or hot and fast . Thus I have broken up the steps in this post to describe both depending on how much time that you have. Regardless the method that you choose, the ingredients are the same for both recipes. Required Kitchen Tools an oven dutch oven or cast iron pot (I use a cast iron pot) spatula baking sheet (for Low and Slow) Ingredients 1 whole chicken seasonings of your choosing (in the photo above, I used McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning) lemon, cut in to quarters or eighths (optional) onions, cut in quarters or eighths (optional) Low and Slow Steps Preheat oven to 250 F (121 C) Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs Dry the skin with paper towel Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin) with the spices of your choosing; if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator or go directly into the oven Place in the oven and let cook for about 4 hours. Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken. Bird is done when your thermometer reads at least 160 F (71 C) at the thigh and breast Remove the pot from the oven Turn your oven on to Broil. Remove the chicken from the pot and place onto a baking sheet. NOTE: There will be a lot of liquid in the pot. The last step of this section addresses this. NOTE: It is easier to remove the chicken from the pot if you cut it in half first. I usually use a spatula to cut the chicken in half (yes it is that tender that you do not need a knife). Then use the spatula to remove the chicken halves in a single piece from the pot to the baking sheet. Place the chicken back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken once the skin has reached your preferred level of crispiness. With the liquid that remains in the pot, you can use it to make chicken broth or chicken gravy. Then the chicken is ready to serve. Hot And Fast Steps Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C) Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs Dry the skin with paper towel Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin) with the spices of your choosing; if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator or go directly into the oven Place in the oven and let cook for about 30 minutes. (This is to crispy up the skin) Turn the oven down to 400 F (204 C) and allow to continue cooking for about 2 hours. Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken. Bird is done when your thermometer reads at least 160 F (71 C) at the thigh and breast Remove the pot from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes NOTE: It is easier to remove the chicken from the pot if you cut it in half first.

Bought it online and installed it myself within a weekend. The kit that I purchased came with the MyQ Internet gateway. You can watch my video review about the opener on YouTube . The Pros It is very quiet. If I open the door while standing on the other side of the house, I barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving. The opener was very easy to install. If you already have a garage door installed, adding this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall. The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there. This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if I chose to change my mind in the future. It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers. In my garage, I have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch. The Cons Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on. I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem. If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home. For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this. I did check the MyQ message board and saw that others have complained about this and a Liftmaster representative responded. However Liftmaster hasn't provide an update to this defect. The MyQ app doesn't always close the door back immediately after it has opened. With my android phone, if I press the button on my phone to close the door within 20 seconds of it being opened, the door doesn't close. However if I force close the app, reopen it, and then press the button to close the door, the door proceeds to close. This is another complaint that i have seen on the MyQ message board.

If I open the door while standing on the other side of the house, I barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving. The opener was very easy to install. If you already have a garage door installed, adding this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall. The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there. This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if I chose to change my mind in the future. It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers. In my garage, I have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch.","title":"The Pros"},{"location":"lifestyle/2018.01.20-1-year-review-of-liftmaster-8500-with-myq-internet-gateway-handyman/#the-cons","text":"Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on. I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem. If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home. For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this.

Transcript (Unedited) IF YOUR TOILET LEAPS LIKE THIS ON THE SIDE WHILE YOU'RE FLUSHING THE TOILET YOU PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE THE GASKET I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP HOW TO REPLACE THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLTS I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION LISTED ON THE PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK THE WATER UP STEP 3 DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT STEP 5 REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE THE OLD GASKET IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO IT BEING STRETCHED AND BEING IN USE FOR A WHILE THE NEW GAS THAT IS SMALLER BUT SHOULD FIT AS IT IS MADE OUT OF RUBBER STEP 6 INSTALL THE NEW GASKET THE NEW GASKET GOES OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND YOU MAY HAVE TO STRETCH IT TO FIT AS I DID IN MY CASE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO STRETCH IT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASILY AS IT IS A RUBBER GASKET ONCE YOU GET IT ON MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN IN AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO SPACE OR ROOM FOR LEAKAGE STEP 7 CLEAN THE MOUNTING POINTS AS YOU SEE THE MOUNTING POINTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BOLT ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET IS VERY DIRTY AND EVEN WITH SOME BLACK CORROSION BE SURE TO CLEAN THESE OFF AS YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CLEAN SO THAT IT MAKES A GREAT SEAL WHEN WHEN CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER IF YOU LEAVE ANY DIRT BEHIND IT MAY NOT CONNECT AS WELL AND YOU STILL MAY END UP HAVING A LEAK AFTER YOU GET DONE STEP 8 INSTALL THE NEW BOLTS SO BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE BOLT AND PUT IN THE RUBBER WASHER AND YOU PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOLT HEAD AND THEN LAYING THE TANK DOWN YOU'LL SIT THE BOLT THROUGH THE BOLT HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL AND THERE'S TWO OF THESE SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS PROCESS TWICE ONE FOR THE LEFT ONE FOR THE RIGHT THEN IF YOU NEED TO YOU CAN ADD THE WASHER AND THE NUT ON THE BOTTOM ON THE PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAVE IT STATED THAT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONFIGURATION OF HOW THE TOILET IS BUILT SINCE MY TOILET PREVIOUSLY HAD A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION I DECIDED TO INSTALL A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION STEP 9 INSTALL THE TANK SO TAKE THE TANK MAKE SURE YOU LINE THE BOLT HOLES UP AND LAY IT ON THE OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE TOILET FLANGE YOU MAY WANT TO ROCK IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ACTUALLY SEALS IN VERY WELL STEP 10 INSTALL WASHERS AND NUTS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL WASHERS AND NUTS THAT GO UNDER THE TANK ITSELF THAT CONNECT THE TANK TO THE ACTUAL PART OF THE BOWL IN THE REAR YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THESE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER WITH A RUBBER WASHER ON TOP A METAL WASHER NEXT TO THAT AND THEN FINALLY THE NUT AT THE END BE SURE TONIGHT OVER-TIGHTEN BEAT THE NUT AT THE END BECAUSE IF YOU OVER TIGHTEN IT YOU CAN CORRECT A CERAMIC ON THE TOILET AND IF YOU PRACTICE CERAMIC OF THE TOILET YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER TOILET IT IS PREFERRED THAT YOU DO A HAND TIGHTEN ONLY AS YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED AND CAN STOP APPLYING PRESSURE BEFORE THE CERAMIC CRACKS STEP 11 RECONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE SO AS YOU DID THE DISCONNECT OF THE SUPPLY LINE YOU BASICALLY UNDO WHAT YOU PROVEN IS DONE SO REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP 12 TURN ON THE WATER I RECOMMEND TURNING ON THE WATER MAYBE A HALF TO ONE TURN AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE NO LEAKS OR YOU DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TURNING FURTHER IF YOU TURN IT ALL THE WAY ON AND IT STARTS LEAKING THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ALL THE WAY BACK OFF THEREFORE YOU CREASE THE CHANCES OF GETTING WATER ON YOUR FLOOR AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT IS NOT WANTED STEP 13 FLUSH AND CHECK THE LEAKS ONCE YOU VERIFY THAT THERE IS NO MORE LEAKS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL ALSO IF YOU LIKE INSTANT

Think about it... do you really remember how much fertilizer that you used 4 years ago on the tomato plants? Probably not. Do you remember how many times that squirrels ate the strawberries before you did last season? Probably not. Do you know how many days that it rained last summer? Probably not. These are just a few examples of why you need to keep track of what you have observed and what you have done in your garden. I use this blog as my garden journal because I'm able to share with others what I've learned from running a garden. What do you need to keep track of in your journal? That's up to you! I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks: weather conditions, including temperature whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants when fertilizer was applied and how much when you started your seedlings when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest pictures of your observations Paper or digital (online) journal? Again, it's up to you! What's more important is that you keep records so that you are able to analyze what you have done. I've chosen to do an online blog because I know I can type faster than I write. Now if you have a digital or online blog, it is easier to find what you are looking for as you can utilize the search functionality. For example, if you create a journal entry each time that you harvest food from your garden, you can do a search for \"harvest\" and the fruit or vegetable that you harvested and find the information quickly. If you have a paper journal, you would have to manually look page by page until you found your latest harvest information. How often should I write in my journal? I would recommend writing a new entry daily or when significant events take place. For instance, if you have non-stop rain for an entire week, I would make note of that in a journal entry. Planting new vegetables for the growing season, make a new journal entry. Squirrels eat half of your three tomatoes, make a journal entry (and remove the half eaten tomatoes from the vine). Journaling may seem pointless in the beginning when you don't have much history to look back at. However as the time progresses and you make some gardening mistakes, you'll learn from those mistakes and end up with a productive and strong garden.","title":"Every Gardener Needs a Journal"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.02.23-every-gardener-needs-a-journal/#what-do-you-need-to-keep-track-of-in-your-journal-thats-up-to-you","text":"I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks: weather conditions, including temperature whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants when fertilizer was applied and how much when you started your seedlings when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest pictures of your observations","title":"What do you need to keep track of in your journal?

However as the time progresses and you make some gardening mistakes, you'll learn from those mistakes and end up with a productive and strong garden.","title":"How often should I write in my journal?"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.04-greens-from-the-winter-garden/","text":"As we enter March, it's almost time to prepare for the summer garden.

Without this occasional pest control, they would devour the leaves resulting in holes or entire leaves missing. This week's weather has multiple frosty nights in the forecast. This is contrary to the severe weather and tornadoes that were experienced during the previous weekend.

As some of you may know, I have, for years, planted my fruits and vegetables mostly in containers and pots instead of directly in the ground. I\u2019ve learned a number of lessons about the differences between planting in the ground vs planting in containers. I\u2019ll cover that in another post. In this post, I will cover how I built multiple raised beds out of concrete blocks. Step 1: How Big and How Many Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started. I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case. For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that\u2019s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side. I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row. If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks that you need. Step 2: Time To Go Shopping For this project, you will need the following: (Please consider using the affiliate links below this post. They help to support this website) concrete blocks (see Step 1 for how many blocks) spirit level (see link below) 2 feet wide object (a lawn mower works) Construction / Work Gloves masonry adhesive (optional) Why concrete blocks? Modern concrete blocks are made of just that... concrete (sand, water, cement). Considerations for using concrete blocks: the ones that you buy will mostlikely not contain any chemicals or other things that are poisionious or dangerous to your health. I would advise not getting blocks from unknown sources. are more expensive than wood. The total amount for the 56 blocks that I purchased was $84, before discounts and taxes have a very long outdoor life regardless of what the weather or ground conditions are like If you do not have the money for concrete blocks, then wood is an option. Considerations for using wood: wood is cheaper than concrete blocks. If you are looking to do gardening for the long term, the cheaper initial cost will be negated by the recurring replacement cost of the wood use untreated wood. Treated wood contains chemicals that can be hazardous to your health if consumed. the outdoor life of untreated wood is shorter than that of concrete. That means that if you live in an area with a lot of rainfall or high water table, that the wood will rot faster than average and therefore will need to be replaced sooner. Step 3: Site Selection After you have purchased the items above, you need to select a flat or mostly flat spot in your yard. My yard actually slopes towards one corner of the yard, so there isn't a truely flat spot in the yard. If you read other articles, they will recommend leveling out the place where you will be placing the blocks to be level. Personally I did not level out anything as digging up dirt and grading it so that it is level is back-breaking work, unless you have a bobcat or some other heavy machinery to assist you with the job. However if your growing space is significantly out of level, I would recommend that you do some grading of the ground. Step 4: Dropping Bricks Now... do not actually drop the brick wildy as it might land on your foot or smash to pieces. Once you have identified your location, start placing your blocks according to the configuration that you have decided on. For this step, you can use the spirit level to make sure that the blocks line up with one another. If you have chosen to secure your blocks, you can use the masonry adhesive between each block that you place. Step 5: Spacing Between Beds If you are making multiple beds, you will want to make a pathway between each of the beds so that have access to all of the sides of the grow bed. For the sake of simplicity, I used my lawn mower to determine the width of the spacing between the beds. Most push and walk behind lawn mowers are between 18 and 22 inches wide. That is almost two feet of space that you did not have to measure. In addition, as you lay out your bed, you do not have to continously re-check the width of the walking path to make sure that it is equal. You now have as much growing space that you can manage. In the next post, I will cover the dirt that I use for the beds.","title":"Building Raised Garden Beds"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.11-building-raised-garden-beds/#step-1-how-big-and-how-many","text":"Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started.

Just a demostration showing the process of what I did get it done. Just removing a dead and decaying tree limb from a tree. The limb has been dead for some time. It was resting a branch that was in front of it. Also some of the upper limbs would break off during windy conditions, thus creating a safety hazard. The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking. Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free. Next I tried to push down the branch. However this did not work as I was not able to get much leverage from pushing. In addition, the limb would slide back after pushing. Since that attempt failed, I got a tow rope and connected it to the tree. The tow rope was slick, so I put a shovel on the other end of the rope to use it as a handle. After a number of pulls, I was able to get the branch down on the ground so that it can be removed and no longer a safety hazard.","title":"Manual Tree Branch Tear Down"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.19-containers-vs-in-ground-gardening/","text":"If you live in a small space container gardening works very great. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to doing container gardening or gardening in pots versus putting your fruits and vegetables directly into the ground. In this post I'm a cover those differences that I've experienced with my growing experiences. So for the past several years I have been growing all of my purse and vegetables in containers instead of the putting them directly in the ground. However, I have noticed that my neighbor has majority of his plant directly in the ground or in raised beds. So after doing some years of research of just only planting in containers or pots these are some things that I've noticed about this process. The Benefits Having your plant in a container versus directly in the ground allows you to better customize the soil to based upon the plant that is that particular container. For instance blueberries have a tendency to prefer more acidic soil versus less a tomato plants. That being said if you have a blueberry plant in just a specific container you can adjust the ratios of your soil so that it is acidic versus having an entire bed that has to be adaptable to a wide variety of everything that you put in that bed. Another benefit of planting in containers is that you can move the container or wherever you need to depending upon the time of year. For instance some plants require more sun song require more shade. As the seasons change you can move the plant to a more shaded area if the plant actually needs more shade or move it to a more Sunny your area and if it needs more sun. Growing in containers actually can restrict the limit of how far the plants can grow out. For instance peppermint plants, is a very vine-like plant. That being said I planted a peppermint plant in a container of about two years ago and after about a year to a year-and-a-half, the peppermint plant had actually become almost root bound in that container. In addition, the peppermint plant itself was actually trying to grow out of the container but it wasn't able to do so since the container was fairly high off the ground and it wasn't able to actually take root into the ground itself. The Negatives The major thing that I've noticed about container gardening is that the soil in the containers have a tendency to dry out faster during hotter weather. The reason is that the pot only can hold so much water and once that water start to evaporate it can't pull water from anywhere else. In my scenario from the last several years, I've actually had to make sure that I watered the container plants every day or every other day and depending upon the temperature and when the last time it rained. Another negative that exist with using containers or pots is that when the weather becomes very severe that the container can actually flip over depending on is dementia. I've used 5-gallon buckets and the five gallon buckets during severe weather in Alabama can lead up to winds in the 40 or more mile an hour range. With these high winds or higher winds, this can result in the plant being knocked over and dirt falling out as well as any reserve water being knocked out as well. This past winter, I noticed that the birds that were migrating through my area would land in the yard and go under the plants that were directly into the ground however they would not go into the ones that were in containers or pots. I'm not sure why that was the case, but it may have had something to do with the birds not being able to see what is in the pot before they go flying into it. Now you may think that birds being able to get into a pot is very insignificant, but they actually play a major role in farming and gardening. In my experience has the birds actually eat the pests like ladybugs, caterpillars, and horn worms, just to name a few, that would normally attack the leaves on the plants that you are growing. With all this being said, this year I will be growing with a combination of in ground beds as well as containers and pots. Hopefully this has given you a good perspective of the differences between growing in the ground versus growing in a container or a pot.

I recently got asked by a high school classmate how I got started with my garden and any tips that I could provide them with to help them get started with hers. In addition, the big box stores are having their spring Black Friday sales. Which means plants and all things plant related,including dirt, tools, etc. are on sale right now. Check your local sales paper for the dates and the details. With the spring Black Friday sale, this is the perfect time for you to start your summer garden. Below I have outlined 8 steps for you to get started. Step 1) Determine A Location The first step to get started with a garden is to determine where you are going to set up your garden in the amount of sunlight that that area gets in a day. If you intend on growing fruits and vegetables this season, then you will want to pick a spot that has mostly sun or is full sun throughout the entire day. The reason is that most fruits and vegetables require a lot of energy to generate those fruits and vegetables that we enjoy, or hate if you are a kid. Step 2) Container Garden Or In The Ground Once you have decided where you want to set up your garden, then you will need to determine whether you are doing a container garden or a garden in the ground or raised beds. I categorize in the ground and raised beds into the same category because they're both permanent fixtures that you set up. Container garden includes putting plants inside of a container, such as a 5 gallon (18.93 liters) bucket, a pot, an old trash can, or a drum. You get the idea. When I first started gardening, I gardened with only containers. This year I've expanded to gardening with raised beds using cinder blocks in addition to the containers I already have. Step 3) Gardening Tools Next you'll want to purchase some gardening tools. You don't need any advanced tools for most of the work. At the very minimum, you want to have a shovel and gloves . The size of the shovel will be determined by what type of garden you choose to set up. A container garden only needs to have a hand shovel whereas a raised bed or in-ground garden needs to have a full size shovel . If you're setting up a raised bed or in-ground garden, I recommend that you also purchase a rake . The rake will help you to level out the dirt and other materials that you are placing in your garden. Gardening gloves will be used to protect your hands. However, if you have latex or other type of gloves those will do the job as well. Step 4) All Dirt Is Not Equal Once you have decided on the type of garden that you want set up, then you will need to get the type of soil that corresponds to the type of garden that you're going to set up. I know what you are thinking...there are different types of soil? Yes there are two distinct types of soil that are sold at the big box stores. The first type of soil is called garden soil. Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used in some type of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them. Whereas the water that's in the ground can be drawn in by plant even if it's not directly underneath the plant or in the soil that the plant is in direct contact with. Step 5) Soil Amendments The soil that you buy from the store can be used immediately. However, when I buy soil from the store, I always add some amendments to it to better the growth of my plants. Those amendments include Epsom salt, peat moss, and compost. For my plants, I use 1/3 of soil, 1/3 of peat moss, and 1/3 of compost. I use the \"it looks about right\" method when measuring out the materials. However if you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added. Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally do not come with soil or from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients. Organic matter is vital to the growth of the plant as the goal of having a healthy garden is to have a sustainable ecosystem. Step 6) Fruits, Vegetables, or Flowers Now that you have your soil you can decide on what type of plants that you want to put in the soil. When you go to purchase the plants that you want to Garden, be sure to look at the tag that comes with the plant. On the tag it will include how much sunlight that the plant needs in order to survive, The water requirements, and what the plant is. When I plant my fruits and vegetables, I usually leave the tag and next to where the plant is. That way in the future I know what the plant is that I'm looking at in a given location. If you happen to lose the tag that goes with a particular plant or a plant does not come with a tag, you can use a plastic butter knife next to the plant and write the name of the plant on the butter knife. Depending on the length of the growing season in the region that you are in, some Fruits and vegetables may not be possible to be grown in your area as it may not be warm enough for the correct amount of days. Step 7) Just Add Water Plants, like any other living creature, need water. The guidelines that I follow regarding water for my outdoor plants is every other day during the hottest part of the season. During the cooler parts of the year, I usually water as needed. This need is determined based upon how dry the top inch to inch and a half of the soil is. If it rains on a given day during the hottest part of the season, I do not water my plants. The reason being is that you want the plants to be able to manage without going daily with water, in case you decide to go on vacation. Step 8) Now That's Some Good Eating I know the section heading is not grammatically correct, but it does prove a point. Once your fruits or vegetables have reached their harvest date,then they are free to pick. How do you know what the harvest date is? The harvest date is written on the tag that comes with the plant. It is possible that the fruit or vegetable can be harvested prior or after the harvest date, but it's not advisable to do so as you want the plant to mature to the best of his ability. Do note that the harvest day is more of an advisory than an exact measurement. The conditions that the plant is in,such as the amount of sun, the amount of water, the health of the soil all play a factor into whether that harvest day is exact or not.

I categorize in the ground and raised beds into the same category because they're both permanent fixtures that you set up. Container garden includes putting plants inside of a container, such as a 5 gallon (18.93 liters) bucket, a pot, an old trash can, or a drum. You get the idea.

A container garden only needs to have a hand shovel whereas a raised bed or in-ground garden needs to have a full size shovel . If you're setting up a raised bed or in-ground garden, I recommend that you also purchase a rake . The rake will help you to level out the dirt and other materials that you are placing in your garden. Gardening gloves will be used to protect your hands.

I know what you are thinking...there are different types of soil? Yes there are two distinct types of soil that are sold at the big box stores. The first type of soil is called garden soil. Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used in some type of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them. Whereas the water that's in the ground can be drawn in by plant even if it's not directly underneath the plant or in the soil that the plant is in direct contact with.","title":"Step 4) All Dirt Is Not Equal"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.04.10-how-to-start-a-garden-in-8-steps/#step-5-soil-amendments","text":"The soil that you buy from the store can be used immediately. However, when I buy soil from the store, I always add some amendments to it to better the growth of my plants. Those amendments include Epsom salt, peat moss, and compost. For my plants, I use 1/3 of soil, 1/3 of peat moss, and 1/3 of compost. I use the \"it looks about right\" method when measuring out the materials. However if you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added. Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally do not come with soil or from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients. Organic matter is vital to the growth of the plant as the goal of having a healthy garden is to have a sustainable ecosystem.","title":"Step 5) Soil Amendments"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.04.10-how-to-start-a-garden-in-8-steps/#step-6-fruits-vegetables-or-flowers","text":"Now that you have your soil you can decide on what type of plants that you want to put in the soil.

One of the recommendations to achieve this is to walk at least 10,000 steps per day, which equates to about 5 miles. Make note that with this recommendation, that you do not have to get all 5 miles done in a single setting or activity. The problem that I noticed was that I work a 9-5 desk job, and there\u2019s really no walking involved for that line of work. After researching and hearing about the consequences of sitting or lack of walking, I decided to make some adjustments to my habits to get more steps in per day. I have a phone and activity tracker that track the number of daily steps. On a typical day where I went from home to work to home without stopping anywhere else, I would log about 2,500 to 3,500 steps per day. That is way below the recommended 10,000 steps per day. So here\u2019s how I chose to try to gain more steps per day without hitting the treadmill or park. Hack 1) Park In The First Empty Spot If you really want some steps, park in the space that is closest to the road and not the store or restaurant that you are going into. Now personally I do not try to park at the door or ride around for finding the closest spot and I also do not park at the very end of the parking lot. Usually, I'll park in between the road and the store. The rule that I do follow is that I do not drive down more than two (2) aisles when looking for a parking space. Not only does riding around looking for the closest parking space waste gas, it also and reduce the number of steps that you get. This adds about 100-200 steps per occurrence. Hack 2) No Drive-Thrus If I go out to eat and the restaurant has a drive through, I skip it and go inside to the counter. Through trail and error from doing this, I have found that by going inside instead of going into the drive-thru, I\u2019m actually able to get in and out faster than those in the drive through. If you believe my experience is flawed, there is a survey that was done by QSR Magazine that stated that the drive-thru line wait time increased from 2013 to 2014 by 40 seconds. In addition, sitting in the drive through wastes gas unless you are driving an electric, hybrid, or auto-stop vehicle. Next time that you go to a fast-food restaurant, as you walk into the restaurant and take note of the last car that is in the drive through line and see if you walk out of the restaurant before the car gets out of the drive thru. This adds about 100-150 steps per occurrence. Hack 3) Take The Stairs If you have the option to take the stairs or the elevator, the default I recommend is to take the stairs. However, if there are no stairs then take the escalator and walk down it. Now if you work or live in a tall building and cannot take all the stairs to your floor, then go as many flights of steps that you can tolerate and take the elevator the rest of the way. This adds about 10-30 steps per floor. Hack 4) When You Gotta Go, Go Further At my job, the restroom is about 20 steps from my desk. The next closest restroom in the office building is about 75 steps, including a flight of stairs (see Hack 3). Just by going to another floor, that\u2019s almost 3 times the number of steps. Round trip, that is about 150 steps and traversing two flights of stairs. If your home has multiple stories with a bathroom on each, then when you have to use the bathroom, go to the bathroom on a floor that you are not on. If your home is single story, then go to the bathroom that is furthest from you or make multiple trips to and from where you are before you go. This adds about 110 steps at work and 40 at home each time that I go. Hack 5) Drink More Water I know what you are thinking\u2026 water has nothing to do with steps. Actually it does though. By drinking more water, you will go to the bathroom more often. When you go to the bathroom more often, then you can apply Hack 4 to get more steps. Before using this hack, I would probably go to the restroom once, sometimes twice, while at work. Now that I drink more water, I go at least two or more times per day. Each time I go, I apply Hack 3 and 4. Hack 6) Set Reminders, Pedometer Alerts I have a pedometer that I wear on my wrist. If it does not detect that I have taken any steps within the last hour, it will buzz and remind me to get some steps in. When it does go off and I am at work, I will get up to use the restroom (Hack 4), get some water (Hack 5), or talk to a coworker in person. If I am on a conference call when it goes off, I will stand up, stretch, and take some steps in my cubicle. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Hack 7) Walk Around Your Car Or House Before You Go In One day, I was waiting at a red light located near a fire station. I noticed some of the firefighters went around to the back of the fire house on the right side. After about 15 seconds, some firefighters came from the back of the firehouse on the left side. However, it was not the group that had gone around on the right. About another 10 more seconds, the group I saw that went around on the right side was coming around on the left side and it occurred to me that they were doing laps. Firefighters cannot leave the firehouse while on shift, because they have to respond when a call comes in, they ran laps around the firehouse as their physical activity. Applying this same strategy, I will sometimes walk around by car before getting in it or walk around my house before going inside. During the walk around the car, I pay attention to the tires and look for any scratch marks or dings that may have appears. When walking around the house, I look at the roof and exterior to see if anything significant has changed. This adds about 25 steps when walking around the car and about 150 steps when walking around the house per occurrence. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Conclusion By doing a combination of these hacks, I've been able to increase my minimal step range from 2500-3500 range to the 4000-5000 range. I know you think that is not a lot, but keep in mind that every step counts. Hopefully, this has inspired you to take small steps in adding steps to your day.

you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to. in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself. the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the ones that are odd numbered starting with the top down you have one event all the way down to the harbor mini Breakers that you have on that particular side so on my outside the breaker number highest ranking number is 25 so I will stop at 25 and then I will start with the even numbers of 2 4 and 6 and I was like that and then use autocomplete to and at 26 which is the highest number that I have on the right hand side so the first record that I have in the number one position is the bath Outlet as well as the exterior Outlets saw internet in and then I will also include the amperage which is 28 and then I will go to the next one which is not connected so I'll just know that is not connected and then I will put in the next two are the air conditioner compressor or connected to the air conditioner compressor and then I will continue this process and then once I get all the way filled in down to 25 and print this out I will actually cut this between Rose 14 and 15 and I will actually add another header here on row 15 so insert an entire row and then copy this header here so that and I can add as actually had another roll so that I have some spacing in between so when I do go to cut this I don't have to be very exact with my cut and sew cut this between here and then so I have the even breakers on one side and then excuse me. Breakers on one side and then he even bring his on the other side now if you have a panel where the door opens sideways you could actually move emails over so that they are side-by-side like this and that way you can better see and then you only have to use one shut up a paper printout to do this however since my breaker panel actually opens up instead of to the left or to the right and going to do this way and split it sideways so I can put them side-by-side on next to space in between the edge of the breaker in the edge of the panel in the breaker itself so for the sales that are really long like this one and these here but I'm actually going to do is through this entire column and set it to do word wrap in LibreOffice calc need to go to text and a text under the format menu and then you can resize a column into text Will resize accordingly and so I'm going to actually shorten breaker number to this breaker and that way it'll allow me to use this room here I can you guys leave an abbreviated if you want to use for space and so I do have one breaker here that is a arc fault or ground-fault breaker breaker actually labeled in the end column that it isn't scription of that is our Breakers to clearly distinguish some reason this sale did not wrap correctly so you may have simply of formatting issues that come up like this and just have to go in and double check on them and if worst case we align the row to get it to do right to be here now is doing correctly are you in some places use the abbreviations to try to help with the wrapping so for instance here instead of spelling kitchen out I just took out all of the files that were in the word kitchen until you get something here that resembles the kitchen counter so counter counter I took out all the vowels yet again so you have cnpr you can kind of figure that out just no reasoning and same thing here with front how do you say it's not fully showing a hold of wrapping correctly so the same thing here with fry and so I will also do the headings on this one and make those bold you know that goes are there and then if you want to you can actually make these rolls alternate Colors video but it's pretty straightforward you know how to adjust the Lights theme background color of a particular role so that I can clearly read all the way across which role you know which item is so if I'm looking for the dryer and I can't cross here and say okay will dryer is 30 amps I can locate fryer bicep on the amperage or I can locate it based upon the position and once you have completed this be sure to save a copy of this in the reason I say that is cuz in the future if you happen to add breaker Outlets name something that say you add an outlet in a new room or you add an additional light in the new room then you know you can go here instead of retyping this all the way over you just make that necessary addition and then free printed back out and stick it back in your breaker box I'm out stop attic grid lines instead of using beat coloring technique will be far easier to read his follow your line finger across the line of the dates and that way you know somebody comes along in the future they won't have to guess when this was last updated though clearly so they know if anything has changed between this date and the current date of whenever they're looking at it then they can reprint this out and put a updated label inside a breaker box so as you see I've completed the printout of the stuff that I was going to do on the computer with the labeling then I've covered it in mailing tape as my breaker panel is outside hopefully this will protect it against the weather and any other elements that may come in contact with the labels I have a copy of this saved on my computer so I can go in and print out additional labels in the future if needed if I need to make any adjustments I can make those adjustments on the print out and then print them back out again this process has helped you in identifying and labeling your breaker panel if you have any questions or comments please leave those in the comments section below if this video has helped you please give this video a thumbs up.","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel-handyman/#identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel","text":"","title":"Identify Electrical Circuits and Label Breaker Panel"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.06.11-identify-electrical-circuits-and-label-breaker-panel-handyman/#summary","text":"This video describes how I went about identifying the breakers in my breaker panel.

Sometimes, I do find myself getting stuck on building an automation. When it comes to programming, you can do an online search and find an example or the exact code for the thing that you are trying to program but cannot figure out how. However, there are times where the answer cannot be found on Stack Overflow. I know every programmer that is reading this probably had a facial reaction or yelled an expletive to the previous sentence, but it is true. I will admit, Stack Overflow does have a lot of the answers to the most common routine programming and computer questions, but there are still unknown unknowns that it does not have the answers to. In my younger programming days (you better not be laughing), I would keep trying different ways of accomplishing the programming task. This, continue working on it until you get it right approach, would work some of the time because I would become so focused on the program until I got it right. Things have changed since then. New technologies have taken over (Python gasp). New programmers are not following the common standards or the specific language, like starting Java functions with an upper case letter, or just coming up with their own standards and wonder why other programmers do not want to touch what they have created. One: You Get More Work Done With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking. I put those JIRA tasks and the amount of time I spend on each task on my Outlook calendar, so that I can get a visual of how much time that I have spent on a given task in comparison to my week. By combining the visual from Outlook calendar and the Scrum Board from JIRA, I realized that I was completing fewer tasks in less time when I got stuck with a programming issue. Those of you familiar with Burn Down Rates and how it can impact a project will probably understand this the best. Staring at the round peg to see how you can get it in the square hole will not make the solution come by easier. If you know that you have other square pegs to place into square holes, then you can work on those and come back to the round peg and square hole. I have even completed lower priority tasks before higher priority tasks because I knew that I had or could reach the solution to that lower priority task faster than the higher priority task. Some project managers may balk at this approach. If they do, my recommendation would be to reference your Burn Down Rate so that they see that you are completing more tasks, although it may not be the high priority ones. Two: The Numbers Favor You The more that you are able to complete in given amount of time, the more valuable and productive that you appear. If your manager is only concerned with the numbers and not the science or reasoning behind the numbers, then this tip is great for you. Managers that only look at the numbers and not the data that supports the numbers think that things are going great because more tasks are getting completed. However, if you have 10 tasks that are to be completed within a sprint, and 5 of those are defects from crappy done work in a previous sprint, then you are really only completing 5 new items instead of 10, thus 50% new feature rate. Solely looking at the numbers may not convey this point depending on how it is presented. If your manager actually wants to know the science or reasoning behind the numbers, this will probably get you on the Naughty List. When I work on an automation, I design it in a way so that unless something major changes (e.g. API changes, new elements on a page, conversion to new technology), that automation will work correctly and has the intelligence to handle minor issues that may occur. That way I\u2019m truly completing the tasks assigned and not repeatedly patching defects or making small adjustments, thus reducing the number of new automations that I can complete. Three: Less Mental Fatigue and Strain Since I was not so dedicated with completing one single task before moving on to the next, I realized that I was able to complete the work without being as mentally drained at the end of the day. Programming does not require much physical effort as most programmers either stand or sit in one spot while they do their work. However the ability to be able to assemble things in a logical fashion takes a lot of mental effort. Combine that with not being able to complete a given task, in other words doing the same thing over and getting the same results, and you will have a high level of frustration and a low sense of accomplishment. Conclusion This article was written with programming and technology examples included. However do note that the main points can be applied to anything that you encounter. For instance: Cannot figure out why the tv will not turn on? Go listen to the radio. Later, check the power cord, surge protector if it is plugged into one, and replace the remote batteries. Cannot figure out why the ice maker is not making ice? Go buy some ice. Later, check to see if the water line is connected and that it has power. Worse case by another fridge. Cannot figure out why that person cut you off in traffic and did not use his or her turn signal? Let them go on down the road. Then pray for that driver\u2019s bad habit be removed from them and continue on to your destination.","title":"3 Benefits of Doing Something Different When Stuck"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.06.13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/#one-you-get-more-work-done","text":"With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking.

That is not a fair, nor equal comparison by no means. The comparisons mentioned below are for the sake of illustration and for laughter. Background I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media. A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant. Before this image went viral, I found a way to save that additional $4 on food that I'm not even going to eat. Believe it or not, what I am about to share with you, I learned it from gardening. Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it. Now gentlemen, these steps will only work if you have a greater and diverse taste pallet than your lady. Do not be afraid to become diverse when it comes to food. So here's how I keep a woman from eating off my plate... Step 1: Learn What She Does Not Eat Or Is Allergic To The first year I got serious about gardening, I planted a combination of fruits and vegetables that I wanted to eat during the growing season. This resulted in me caring for bunch of green leaves and no fruit. Talking about disappointment... it was major. So after doing some research about squirrels, I found that their diet consists of mostly of nuts and small fruit. I had to make a choice... grow the food that squirrels and I both love so much and fight them to eat it, or grow something that I love and that the squirrels hate. Since I'm responsible for maintaining the garden, growing what the squirrels did not eat became the priority. In the end, I did not have to protect my garden with Fort Knox security because they were not attracted to what was in the garden. To apply this step to women, find out what she does not eat or is allergic to. There are several ways that you can figure this out. Just ask. She may tell you everything. She may tell you only part of the list. Whatever she tells you, be sure to make note of it. Check the pantry. That's right... go in her pantry or cabinets. You have to decide whether you want to be discrete about it or not. If you do not see beans in her cabinet, that's probably on the Do Not Eat List. Watch what she eats. If y'all go to a restaurant that is known for burgers, and she orders chicken, then there is a great chance that she does not eat beef. If she orders French Fries with Ranch, then she probably does not eat ketchup. If she orders the vegan shrimp tacos, then she probably does not eat actual meat. Step 2: When Eating, Order The Items You Have Identified From Step 1 With my knowledge of the squirrel diet, I revamped my garden to include jalapeno peppers, lettuce, and turnip greens. After planting these items, I rarely saw a squirrel near the garden or in the yard. Why? They weren't attracted to what was there. Thus staying away and looking else where. Now there are times where Step 2 may not fully work. That's when you still order what you want, but modify it accordingly. For instance... You like chicken, your lady likes chicken, and your lady hates BBQ sauce. Pour BBQ sauce on the chicken. Problem solved. You order a salad, your lady likes salads, your lady also likes Ranch dressing, but your lady does not eat Ranch dressing on her salad. Order a salad with Ranch dressing... and coat it thoroughly. Problem solved. You go to a seafood restaurant, your lady likes shrimp and does not like spicy food. Order shrimp and cover it with hot sauce. Problem solved. If she always orders Papa Johns', then you order Domino's or Pizza Hut. Problem solved. Step 3: Check The Reaction When squirrels are scouting the area, they will look and stand on their hind legs or climb a tree to get a better field of view. When they cannot find what they think they saw, they continue digging and looking and digging and looking. Eventually they will give up and look elsewhere for food. Before a woman swipes... I mean steals food off of your plate, she will do an analysis of what you have on your plate with or without your prior knowledge. Think of it like Robocop walking down the street and he is analyzing each person's face to see if he or she is the individual matching a suspects description. Instead of faces being scanned, it is the food on your plate. Scanning baked beans... will cause gas... skipping. Scanning potato salad... does not have boiled eggs... skipping. Scanning mac and cheese... it has raisins in it... skipping. Scanning chicken wings... confirming it has lemon pepper seasoning... TAKE IT, TAKE IT. Now if she scans your entire plate and does not find anything that appeals to her taste buds, she will make a comment about that fact. You may hear one or more of the following phrases accompanied with an unpleasant facial expression: \"I don't see how you eat that stuff.\" \"I don't need none of that.\" \"You know eating insert food name is not good for you.\" If you hear any of the preceding phrases or something similar, you sir have successfully saved your food from being stolen. Conclusion Ladies, you have to understand that there is nothing more satisfying to a man than to be able to order what he wants and knowing that he will be able to clean the entire plate. When a lady eats from a man's plate, he will not get full because of the fact she has reduced the portion size. Thus he has to venture to the kitchen or some other place for a midnight snack because he was deprived of calories. As previously mentioned, these steps can only be achieved if you have a greater diversity in your taste pallet than your lady. Lacking this essential trait, means that you will never be successful eating your entire plate if she is around. These are just my thoughts.","title":"Squirrels Taught Me About Women and Food"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.07.03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food/#background","text":"I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media. A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant.

Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it.

Therefore, I took 28 days to see what would happen. Was I trying to overachieve by doing more than what was necessary? Nah. Initially, it was going to be 21 Days of Prayer that my church. It was coincidence that part of the 21 Days of Prayer was overlapped by the 21 Days of Miraculous Meditation done by Deepak Chopra. Combine this with the dating/relationship issues that I had and the certification course that was about to start for the next 4 weeks and it was almost like I walking into a season of turmoil. So what habits did I choose to do for this season that I saw myself entering? I have about 15-20 items on the habits list. I am not going to cover them all and the impact that they had as this post would be unreasonably long. Habit 1: Ride with the Radio Off Not the volume turned all the way down, but I actually pressed the power button and turned it off. In order to not make things awkward when I had passengers, I did turn the radio on while they were riding. Once they got out, radio went back off. 1) You may more attention to what is going on around you while you drive. You would not believe how many folks drive with their cell phones in their hand. Well you probably do. One thing that I did notice, is that a lot of the drivers that I saw with phones in their hand(s), had damage to their right front bumper and headlight area. From watching Canada's Worst Driver , they stated that a lot of drivers usually hit something on the passenger side more than the driver side. Makes sense as most drivers would not put themselves in danger when they have full control. In addition, most people drift to the right in their lane instead of the left as drifting left will put you into oncoming traffic on rural and residential roads. 2) You can think without being interrupted. When your song gets played on the radio, you know the one that I am talking about that makes you turn the radio up on blast and have a one man/woman choir, it distracts you from what you were previously thinking about or interrupts the conversation that you were having with your passengers. Traffic report comes on, you focus on what is being said to make sure there are no accidents in the direction that you are headed. With the radio off, you can figure out that programming problem, replay a conversation back and figure out why you said what you said, or if you believe in an higher power to pray. Habit 2: Eat Meat Once Per Day Maximum I know you are saying that that is impossible to do. It actually is very possible to do. The habit with this is that I could eat as much meat as I wanted, but it had to be consumed within a single meal or snack. Depending on where you live, it may be harder to do in some places than others. Where I live, there are not many vegan or vegetarian only restaurants, but there are restaurants that do offer vegan and vegetarian options. One side effect was that my bathroom habits changed. I realized that meat slows down my digestion, so when I would eat a large amount of meat, I would not \u201cgo\u201d as often. For me, it involved a lot of thinking ahead about what I was going to eat. It also involved taking a lunch everyday\u2026 yes single day\u2026 instead of going out for lunch. Some days, that meant I ate a big bowl of oatmeal for lunch as I didn\u2019t cook dinner the night before. Habit 3: Pack A Lunch During the month of August, I had many expenses come up. Vehicle registration, having tress cut, new car battery after the previous gave out unexpectedly, home repairs\u2026 it was a lot. I calculated the amount that I had spent on going out to eat during the month of July. It totaled to about $75 or the equivalent of 1.5 tanks of gas. When I started looking more intently at the non-essential things that I was spending my money on and converting that to the financial equivalent of the essentials that I was spending my money on, it put things into a greater perspective financially that I was really living at my means. So by cutting back on takeout and going out to eat, I was able to divert those funds to things that would bring me a greater sense of accomplishment, like doing handy work or my own car repairs or making financial investments with the savings. Habit 4: Work It Out One of the ways to reduce stress is to work out. So I made a commitment to myself to do Focus T25 or Wii Sports a couple of times per week. Now I did not follow the T25 workout plan as it was designed given that I did not have the time to be able to do so. My strategy was that some workout is better than no workout. Was I sore the first week of consistently doing Wii and T25? Yes. Almost to the point that I would rather sit or lay down than stand up. Did I feel a change in my body and level of energy? Yup. Conclusion Now I am not saying that what I have done will work for you. Everybody is different and has their own way of dealing with the complexities of life. That said, consider this post as a guide for what you can do for your 21+ day habit changing, fasting or prayer. These are just my thoughts.","title":"21 Days for a New Habit"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.08-15-21-days-for-a-new-habit/#background","text":"They say that it takes 21 days to learn a new habit and to break old ones.

This week's particular movie was \"Disney's Christopher Robin\". As I was in church, watching this message and movie, it spoke to me given the number of changes that were taking place in my life. SPOILER ALERT: I do mention scenes from the movie. So if you have not watched the movie yet and hate spoilers, go watch the movie before reading this article. Things That I Got From This Movie Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest. This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil. When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset There\u2019s a song, called \"Holy Ghost Power\" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them. In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result. We Are Not Who We Used To Be. Sometimes We Become Lost The smartest of people make mistakes. We are all human. When a bridge failure or airplane malfunction occurs, often the maintainers and engineers get the blame. The investigators often go back to the original drawings and design to see if there were any miscalculations, typos, or other errors that were overlooked. Once those errors are identified, they are corrected so that they do not occur again. Whether it be redrawing the bridge or redesigning a component of the plane, it has now become better and it is not what it used to be. In the movie, this was reflected by Christopher Robin going back to the Hundred Acre Wood. Once there and Christopher Robin had to show the other inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood that he was indeed Christopher Robin as they last remembered him being a young boy and not a man. I like to refer to this as \"growth and development\". Find What Makes You Happy In the movie, Christopher Robin and Pooh are at the train station trying to catch the train to take Pooh back home. Pooh sees a balloon stand and says that he wants a balloon. Christopher initially says no but then gives in after Pooh mentions that the balloon will bring him happiness. Getting big things and dreams accomplished do bring us happiness, but sometimes it is the small things that can bring us the most happiness. For me, that would mean being in the presence of others, also known as quality time, that brings the greatest amount of happiness. Conclusion Everything happens for a reason. For me, it felt like perfect timing as these takeaway points and more are steps that I need to take to go forward in life.","title":"Takeaways from Christopher Robin movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#things-that-i-got-from-this-movie","text":"","title":"Things That I Got From This Movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#doing-nothing-often-leads-to-the-very-best-of-something","text":"Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest. This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil.","title":"Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#when-you-get-lost-you-need-to-reset","text":"There\u2019s a song, called \"Holy Ghost Power\" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them. In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result.","title":"When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#we-are-not-who-we-used-to-be-sometimes-we-become-lost","text":"The smartest of people make mistakes.

Weather has changed for the cooler and you have a bunch of leaves in your yard. Are you really going to want to spend time raking them? Probably not. There are various ways to handle leaves when the season change. Let Leaves Leave That's right. You can leave them in the yard and eventually they will blow into the street, decompose, or blow into the neighbors yard on their own. I took this approach one season and all was good during the winter time. However, when the weather started getting warmer, the grass was not growing. Come to find out, the leaves have smothered the grass during the winter. Thus resulting the grass dying completely and weeds taking over like they had nothing else to do. This is an approach that I would not recommend, especially if you like to have a lush, green lawn. Blow Them Away I have one neighbor that blows all of his leaves from his yard to the curb. Then the city will come by and scoop them up with other tree, limb, and other debris. In turn, the city uses those leaves for mulch, compost, or other projects around the city like in parks or roadside greenways. Chop It Up This is my preferred method. Pull out the lawn mower and mulch the leaves. In years past, I've mulched them and left them on the ground to decompose. This helps return the nutrients that were removed from the soil, to go back into the soil. Also prevents the need to bag the leaves, which means more work. I rarely bag leaves, as it adds unnecessarily to the landfill. If you have a compost pile, leaves are good brown material that can be added to the pile. Get Hustled If you have kids that go around the neighborhood looking to do yard work, then outsource it to them. Be sure to pay them reasonably for their efforts.","title":"You Still Rake Leaves?"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.12.22-you-still-rake-leaves/#let-leaves-leave","text":"That's right.

As you can imagine, the course is designed for Canadians, but I found that the concepts, ideas, and terminology could be applied to individuals in other countries. I was able to complete the course in about 4-5 hours (I did it all on Christmas Eve). The article that was written about the course, gives more insight into what the course is about and who it is designed for. Once you complete the course, you will receive a certificate of completion. Feel free to read the article . Below are my notes from the course. They are not well structured, but I did make an effort to note the key points that were mentioned in each section. I have also included my test results from each section in case you want to compare your results to mine. For each section, you have to get 80% or greater in order to pass each module. I would encourage you to take the course for yourself even if you are good with money. I consider myself to be good with money, but did not realize until I got to Module 8 that there is a psychological aspect to how well or bad you are with money and investing. Module 1, Intro No notes from this section. No test for this section. Module 2, Debt and Borrowing Common Sources of Debt understand what sources of credit are most appropriate terms and conditions for the type of debt Credit Cards are easier to obtain rewards and benefits look at the fees and interest rates a card may have a high rate, but the benefits can outweigh the rate Lines of Credit operates similar to checking account as it gives debit cards or is connected to checks it accrues interest immediately usually has lower fees and interest rates than credit cards people often usually take out a larger balance for line of credit than for credit cards as they have lower rates Long Term Financing usually used for larger costs assets, cars, or houses if you don't pay for it in full, then the asset is repossessed the asset is collateral Mortgages used specifically for buying a home minimum down payment is usually required, 5% to 20% down payment cant be used from other sources, like line of credit mortgage loan insurance covers the lender in case you default a change of the mortgage term will require agreement between the two parties involved loans are amortized type of interest rate is a consideration. mortgage payments stay the same with fixed rates. However variable rates will cause your payment amount to go up. time and interest are impacted by the mount of payments made during the repayment period Credit Scores Credit Worthiness Credit history is used and based on credit report. Like a report card and how responsible you are includes debt sent to collections, bankruptcy, usually stay on report for 6 years, but may stay on longer positive info, like making on time payments, may stay on longer math formula is used to calculate the score; from 300-900 (in Canada) factors include how long you have had credit for, outstanding balances, missed payments, amount of outstanding debts, if debts have been sent to collections, being close to the credit limit, times you've tried to get more credit, record of insolvency or bankruptcy good credit gives you preferential interest rates check your credit report regularly Rules for Borrowing live within your means always use debt wisely need a solid plan for repaying debt before getting it Passed with 80% score. Module 3, Your Money Today and Tomorrow Time value of money - the amount of money is wroth more the sooner it is received Compounding allows you to earn interest on interest present value and future value fv = pv * (1 + r)^t fv = 100 * (1 + 0.04)^2 fv = 108.16 the higher interest rate or greater number of periods, the higher the future value can only compare values at the same point in time IF they are not at the same point in time, then you have to bring them to the same point in time Discounting money traveling backwards in time, it is called Discounting; the reverse of compounding pv = fv / (1 + r)^t pv = 104 / (1 + 0.04)^1 pv = 100 Everyday Applications doing investments in installments will earn more interest than a lump sum doing payments in chunks, less interest is charged on the remaining balance I passed with a 90%. Module 4, Strategic Budget Building need to have a budget budgets also deal with the time value of money Why Budget budget is estimate of income and expenditures over a given period of time cash in vs cash out you want to have a surplus, more income than expenditures process of budget helps achieve goals Tips and Techniques structured planning approach Preparing kick off meeting; write 1-3 words where you stand financially write 1-3 words where you like to be 1-3 years from now, balance ambition and reason include a vision statement write 5 biggest challenges to achieving budget goals include information that you need to stand where you are and where you would like to be supplementary material is available for the course have stakeholders involved to help you achieve your goals in the future; important to have those connections established Analyzing make fact-based decisions calculate your revenue and expenditures use the revenue tool that is available Deciding finalize the 3-year vision strategies to overcome the challenges and achieve the vision look back at the vision statement, adjust it as needed; should be 1-2 sentences refine the vision based on the challenges identified 5-7 ways to overcome the challenges to be able to achieve the vision Keys Steps to Budgeting achieving quick wins list 3 things that will get done in 2-3 months to achieve goals use KPIs to track progress; come up with 3-5 key areas (bank balance, investments, etc) if you get behind on your KPI, then adjust and keep going Key takeaways annual budget is important have a vision where you want to be in 3 years review budget throughout the year new budgets celebrate successes Passed section with 100%. Module 5, The Art of Investing, Part 1 Investment Options need to know the difference between stocks and bonds stocks are very risky bonds are IOUs, more secure you make money from a bond via the interest money market = bonds less than 1 year bonds promise a fixed income long term bonds have more risk than short term companies bonds are more risky than government bonds bonds are less risky than stocks stocks usually have higher returns, 8% on average bear vs bull markets how to invest open brokerage account mutual funds have professionals that invest on investors behalf active mutual funds adjust over time passive mutual funds just follow the market, usually are cheaper than active the earlier you start investing, the better Common Mistakes and Rules to Avoid Them Diversification most investors repeat the same mistakes s and p 500 index - large 500 stocks in the market, gives an overall picture of the performance of the stock market compare the stocks to the S and P and it is less volatile diversification doesn't eliminate every kind of risk , value can still go down if there is bad news about the entire economy how do you diversify maximizing by including every kind of industry in your portfolio invest in index funds, buys multiple funds ; they don't trade a lot also invest internationally diversification doesn't protect from market crashes usually the market recovers from crashes; thus the high risk for stocks the dot com boom the .coms got to high levels and then the bubble popped learn from the mistakes of others buy low, sell high; basic rule for making money of the market most people do the opposite should be expected that there will be more than one financial crisis in your lifetime keep investing when markets are depressed markets usually recover from crashes after a few years minimize investment expenses the more the trade, some have worse experiences investment expense should be controlled; find low costs investments investing fess make a big difference when it comes to compounding if your money you will get less over time, in some cases by half summary diversified portfolio don't buy low and sell high ; mood of the market keep investing when things look bad minimize investment expenses be cautious when market becomes excited about a company or invention that will \"change the world\" Failed with 70% first time Passed with 90% second time Module 6, The Art of Investing, Part 2 Progressive Income Tax in Canada Doesn't apply to be since I'm in the US, so I didn't take notes on this. Considering Income Tax when Investing investment income is taxed on top of your regular income Paying Down Debt interest saved on debts are not taxed paying personal debt should be considered first Government incentives Information in this section is specific to Canada. However it does describes in a similar nature of how retirement accounts work in the US. From what I can gather is TFSA = Roth 401K or Roth IRA RRSP = Traditional 401K Failed with 60% on first attempt Passed with 100% on second attempt Module 7, The Realities of Real Estate Why Real Estate? capital appreciation provides a sense of security can use it as leverage to borrow money can use it to reduce taxes value of real estate, the market usually keeps up with inflation but can go down with economic down turns Factors to Consider location population and income growth growing cities need more housing and provide a stable stream of income, and more capital appreciation Detroit is used as an example macro factors more people will buy houses when mortgages when rates go down constraints play a factor, such as the higher cost of living micro factors where and what you want to buy up and coming neighborhood or established neighborhood what do you want to buy? price and in relation to the size of the property consider age of the building Housing Affordability and Rent vs Buy Decision know whether you can afford a house or not in your current state spend no more than 28% to 36% of your income on housing house to rent ratio ;some cases means that it is better to rent than to buy price to rent ratio = price of property / annualized rent alternative ways to invest in real estate invest in REITs (real estate investment trusts) REITs can have different property types. usually are very good Failed with 70% on first attempt Passed with 80% on second attempt Module 8, Behavioral Finance cross between psychology and finance investor irrationality What Kind of Investor Are You? risk aversion risk aversion - how much do you dislike risk most investors are risk averse there are different levels of risk aversion less risk would be treasury bills, gics higher risk would be stocks there is no true way to assess risk aversion risk aversion factors investors level of wealth - wealthy investors can take on more risk age - younger investors can afford to take on more risk can recover from bad mistakes based on future income and being able to bounce back over time personal situation and liquidity needs personality - some worry more than others. some don't worry enough. Thus it factors in to how much each person is willing to risk. Psychological Mistakes emotions can impact investment decisions Behavioral Biases - observed tendency for some to make mistakes biases conservatism bias - under react to new information, incorporate prior information representativeness - similar to stereotypes; over-extrapolation of long trends disposition effect - sell stocks in their portfolio that work well and hold under-performing stocks; often related to a state of denial biased self attribution - attribute their success to their own skill when they are making money, but claim bad luck when things go wrong fear - fear has impact related to the risk you are willing to take; avoid making financial decisions when in a high emotional state three stages of grief denial anger bargaining Investment Strategies trading strategies momentum trading - invest in stocks that have done well over the past year related to conservatism bias; the market can be slow to react to the news, thus a delay in reaching its true value post-earnings announcement drift - continue drifting in the initial direction after the initial announcement; related to the conservatism bias; results in the stock price not increasing as good as it should Passed with 80% on first attempt","title":"McGill University Personal Finance Essentials"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.12.26-mcgill-university-personal-finance-essentials/#module-1-intro","text":"No notes from this section.

Greens don't make seeds until the spring or summer time. When they make seeds, they make a lot. Not sure at this point whether I'm going to let them continue to grow in the grass or cut the grass and greens once the summer growing season starts. For now, they will remain. It is possible that they may outgrow the surrounding grass and weeds. If they do, the shade produced by the greens will reduce the chance of grass growing near them. Red Romaine For about week in early December, we had temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s for several days in a row. I believe that it was at this time that the red romaine decided to go from leafy mode to seed mode. When I first noticed this, I pulled the blooms off of the plant in hopes that it would switch back to leaf mode with the colder temperatures that followed. However, it did not and as a result the leaves are still narrow on the plant. Raised Beds The items that are in the raised beds that I set up in the spring of 2019 are not doing as well as the items that are in other containers or directly in the ground. I think this, in part, has to do with the fact that I put pine mulch in the raised beds in the beginning of the spring season. What I found out after I put the mulch down, was that pine mulch usually makes the soil acidic. I'm not sure how acidic it made the soil, but based on the articles that I read about it, it can lower the pH to 5 or 4 range. The tomatoes that grew in the same bed in the spring, did extremely well. However, the lettuce, cabbage, and greens that are currently in the bed are not doing as well. In some of the raised beds, I have added ashes from the firepit to the bed. The articles that I read suggested that by doing this, the soil will become more basic as the ashes break down.

Of course I asked about why she chose the word that she chose and her response was rather motivating that I ought to do the same to set myself on a better trajectory for the year. I have to be honest thought. I had never heard of a yearly word concept. After doing some online research, skipping over the number of articles that talked about Merriam-Websters word of 2019 (which was \"them\"), I found out that this has been a thing since 2006 . Who knew? Some articles suggested picking a word for each quarter of the year. Thinking of 4 words for 12 months was a bit more difficult as I struggled to decide on one word for the entire 12 months. Eventually I did decide on a word. Here is how I went through the process of determining a word for the year. Make a List I started by making a list of words that I thought would be the most relevant for me this year, that highlight things that I did not get quite right last year, and something that I knew I could stick to. After some debate, and online research, I came up with the following list: dominate leadership create elevate relationships Each word has a back story in how it made it to the list. Dominate I started a new job a couple of months ago. One of the major things about this job, is that it has required me to learn technology that I have not worked with in almost a decade. Given this significant shift, I want to be very great at it coming out of the gate. I remember watching \"Storm Chasers\" back in the day and during some of the episodes, Reed Timmer would say \"dominate, dominate, dominate\" over and over again while they were chasing tornadoes. I felt that by him saying the word over and over and over again, it reinforced his drive to seek out, find storms, and to be able to chase better than most that had been in the industry longer than him. Leadership If you have read any of John Maxwell's books, you know all he talks about is being a leader. Being a leader does not mean that you have to be at the top. It does mean that you can motivate and obtain followers where you currently are. Demonstrating leadership can help you get to the top. Create As you may know, I have a YouTube channel where I show viewers how to do projects that they might be considering or how to do something when it comes to technology (after all I do work in IT). However, my channel has not been as successful as I would like it to be. The reasoning behind this word, was to create better and more content than I have in years past. In doing so, I would hope that I would increase my subscriber base and following. Elevate Seeing the potential in others can make them feel better in their worse time. I do believe that we are called to be able to support each other when we have the resources to be able to do so. In turn, those that support will get support for their efforts. Relationships I had a dating relationship that failed in the previous year over differences in opinion. Also had some friendships that kicked the can as well. Having those relationships end was never the end goal, but here I am. Also, I am an introvert. Most introverts do not have large friendship circles or networks, mostly because it takes so much energy to maintain those circles. However, I do have a desire to engage and interact more with others despite my introverted ways. My Word for 2020 After much contemplation, I chose \"relationships\" as my word for 2020. I realized that relationships are the key or foundation to each one of the other words in my list. dominate - While it is possible to dominate on your own, it is easier to and better do it with a team. One of the main examples of this was Reed Timmer. He and his team of storm chasers would follow storms for several days and weeks on end. Without those relationships, you cannot have a dominate. leadership - In order to be a leader, you have to have a relationship with the people that you are going to lead. create - Those that create digital content, do it in part because of the relationships that you can build with others online. Without those relationships of interacting with people, the content that individuals create would be useless. elevate - Connect with people before you correct people. Being able to build others up is a good skill. From my experience, in order to be able to improve the lives of others, you have to have a positive relationship with those individuals. Conclusion Hopefully this article has inspired you to come up with a word for the year in effort to better achieve your goals.","title":"Word of the Year 2020"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.01.03-word-of-the-year/#word-of-the-year-2020","text":"","title":"Word of the Year 2020"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.01.03-word-of-the-year/#background","text":"A friend was telling me that she had chose a word for the year.

For the past two years, I have given up something during the fasting season and kept track of it on my Trello board. This year, I have decided that I would blog about my experience and results from fasting. My goal is to update this post each day with the updates for that particular day. Why 21 days? It has been said that if you commit to doing or not doing something for 21 days in a row, that it will become a habit and you will be more inclined to continue doing or not doing it beyond the 21 days. I did a fast last year for 21 days and some of those habits have stuck. Updates I will be posting my daily updates here so that you can follow along in my progress. Perhaps you have your own fast that you want to consider doing for the start of the year. Day 0 - January 4 I know what you are thinking... why is he starting to count with 0 instead of 1? Computers start their counting of items with 0. However, humans usually start with 1, so programmers like myself have to add additional code in so that the counting will be acceptable to humans. Consider this day to be the day of preparation before entering the fast. My goals during this fast are to do the following: No Facebook Social media is addictive. Main reason that I am avoiding Facebook is because I login to that website more than the other social media accounts that I have. I did see a post that said to not use social media less but to use it more intently. That post is the header graphic of this post. I do plan on doing this more after the fast is over. For the fast though, I have found that when I cut out the most addictive social media habits, that I am able to do more of the things that I previously have put off to the side. Daily Commits to Github As part of my personal branding strategy, I want to actually demonstrate that I do participate in the IT community and provide digital contributions. That said, I plan on contributing to making at least one commit to any of my repositories per day during the fast. I know it seems excessive, but hear (or read) me out on this. Not all of my commits will be code related. The version control for my blog is on Github, so some of those commits will be new or updated content for my website. Other commits will be new or updated code that I have done. No Meat, Little to No Cheese I have refrained from eating meat in the past. There were some noticable differences such as having a flatter stomach, going to The John more frequently, and being more energetic. In addition, I have watched documentaries that state that eating too much meat can have a negative impact on your body. When it comes to cheese, I have noticed that eating a lot of it can change my regularity. Since the last fast, I have gotten away from eating it sparingly. Thus I want to get back in that habit of not eating it as frequently. Journal Daily I have discovered in recent months that there is something about writing your thoughts and ideas out. Yes, there is the scripture in Habakkuk about writing the vision and making it plan. I also think that journaling allows us to clear our heads from the things that we want to remember, but do not necessarily need to always keep readily on our minds. In other words, it allows you to \"clean out the attic\". I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM periodically, then you will run into problems. On Linux systems, if you fill up the temporary storage, the OS might crash. Two Day Rule for Exercising Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activity. Water, Tea, or Natural Juices As I have gotten older, I rarely drink sodas. During this fasting season, I am going to make an effort to not drink anything that may contain High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) as a lot of products contain this substance. They say that HFCS is fine to consume in moderation. Only problem that I have is... 1) What is \"moderation\"? Is it once per week, once per quarter, once per year? 2) It is hard to have something in moderation, when it is contained in majority of the food and drink that we consume. Daily Prayer As if this was obvious enough... heck it is in the title of the post. Day 1 - January 5 Today I had no meat. Went to Chipotle for lunch and an Indian restaurant for dinner. I only had water and tea to drink today. I spent the morning of today serving at church, so had to get up slightly earlier than normal. However, I was able to take a nap after the church services. I interacted with others about this and my previous post regarding my word of the year . It was very enlightening to hear about others' doing the same thing as myself, but for their personal benefit and mental health. I did not get around to exercising. Definitely is a must for tomorrow though. I did refrain from Facebook. I made a post yesterday on IG and Twitter, so I responded to messages and comments regarding those. I did find myself mindlessly scrolling, which I am trying to get out of the habit of. Once I realized that I was doing it, I redirected my focus to being more productive. Day 2 - January 6 Only had one real meal today and that was lunch. Had the remaining Chipotle from yesterday with some chips, Nutty Buddy bar, and a muffin. As I write this at 8 PM, I don't feel hungry, although I could eat. Was up earlier than normal today. I took that time to write in the journal and to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the new ones that I have set for this year. I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already had to modify them as they call for meat. Photos will be posted in the days to come an whether I would make them again or if I need to donate that cookbook to the local library. Day 3 - January 7 Was able to get a walk around the block in today. Could have walked an additional block as I did not do a walk yesterday. Made lemonade from scratch for the first time. It definitely has the lemon kick in it. Will need to use less lemons next time. Watched a sermon that was sent to me titled \"Looking Back, Keep Sitting, or Moving Forward\". It was a good message as it talked about how that we all have a past. However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6. I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing a system that works for you. I feel that these practices that I am learning can be applied to the work that I do. Day 4 - January 8 I actually managed to sleep a full night last night. Not sure why that was the case. It could possibly be because of the lack of meat in my diet, thus changing my body chemistry. Who knows? Surprisingly, I have been able to keep up with daily commits to this post and to Github as I have set out to do. I updated one of the sites that I had not updated in over a year. It had a number of security patches that needed to go in. In addition, the automated deployment script that I had created, was not working because of the execute permissions not being set (doggone Linux). Walking during lunch breaks is a good thing as it allows me to get in the recommended 10K steps per day. However, I do need some shoes that are intended for walking such distances during lunch break, as the dress shoes that I normally wear are clearly not cut out for that job. Day 5 - January 9 I listened to a sermon that talked about letting the past be the past, and to focus on what is to come in the future. I have been listening to more sermons recently, and this seems to be a common theme among them. These sermons were all delivered around the end of 2019. Watched some videos today, that had me thinking about some side income ideas that I could use to advance and extend my skillset in the IT field. I have watched several videos about people that are using Fiverr to make income. I used Fiverr back in 2011, but had not really be active on the platform recently. I figured that I could use platforms like these, to build automations to make the turnaround time for some of the requests faster thus reducing the manual amount of work required on my part. Day 11 - January 16 I have been sick the last few days. Managed to catch the flu. I am still in the recovery phase as I write this. This is part of the reason why there is a gap of about a week between updates. During this time, I have managed to go outside during the daytime, weather permitting, and capture some sunlight. Being in the house all day quarantining yourself because of doctor's orders is no fun, but it is a necessary precaution. Not sure who found out that sunlight helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like boost of energy. Not quite like the boost that Popeye gets after eating a can of Spinach, but more like never riding a bike before and once you get on the bike realizing the purpose of the training wheels. I have been told many of times how my post about squirrels taught me about women and food is insanely funny. I did not realize that it would catch on in the way that it did, but I am glad that I can share my story with others and they get something out of it. I have gotten through almost entire week of ASP.Net Core MVC training. What that means is that I can build enterprise grade applications that will run a multiple platforms. This is definitely a useful skill that I am glad that I am able to add to my toolbelt. To my surprise, I have only missed 2 out of 11 days thus far, making a commit to any of my repositories on Github. Having a blog that is versioned on Github has helped with this cause. Also having requests for me to share knowledge about Python and Linux have added to the commits. Those of you that have requested such info, thanks! Day 12 - January 17 Completed training for ASP.Net Core MVC. The training is related to projects that I will be working on in the future. It was good to get training and some exposure to the subject prior to actually having to work with it.

It has been said that if you commit to doing or not doing something for 21 days in a row, that it will become a habit and you will be more inclined to continue doing or not doing it beyond the 21 days.

In other words, it allows you to \"clean out the attic\". I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM periodically, then you will run into problems.

I took that time to write in the journal and to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the new ones that I have set for this year. I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already had to modify them as they call for meat.

However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6. I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing a system that works for you.

Not sure who found out that sunlight helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like boost of energy.

Normally lettuces and other leafy greens do well during the winter season due to the cooler temperatures and the occasional frost that controls bugs and sweetens the leaves. This winter season, we have experienced temperatures in the low and mid 70s for several days to a week at a time. That is definitely unseasonably warm, and as a result, all of the red lettuce and some of the green leaf lettuce bolted in the middle of December. I remove the flowers that were starting to appear when I first noticed the lettuce flowering and that got some of them back in check. However the red lettuce was committed to making flowers, so I removed it from the garden. It is currently in cue in the firepit so that it can dry out and be used back in the garden as compost. Onions I have a green onion that I planted several years ago. This winter, it has grown a lot bigger and taller than in years past while remaining in the same container. I did make a IG post about this particular plant and how big that it has gotten. The backstory about this particular onion, is that I got it from either Blue Apron or the grocery store. I do not recall which. If you watch videos or read articles about gardening, they will suggest that you do not use store bought fruits and vegetables in your garden as they will not do well. This onion plant has proved that to be far from the truth. Like any other plant, if you put it in the right environment and give it what it needs, it will grow and multiply. Collard and Mustard Greens Once I got to planting the leafy greens that I was going to grow for the season, I realized that I probably bought more than what I should have. I have greens all over the place, with several of the plants having leaves over one foot long. Seriously. In another recent IG post, I showed that there are greens that have taken root from the seeds that have dropped off in the grass in my yard. If you missed that post, you can watch it on my Instagram page . Those greens have since continued to grow. I plan on digging them up to be relocated as they currently are in the place where I plan on expanding my deck. I will be sure to provide a progress report on those in the future. Weather Weather since the last post as been a mix of rain and sun. There were several severe storms that have passed through the area.

This trip is the second time that I have done the zip line at this location. Mega Zip Line Make Your Reservation I was able to make my reservation via the Red Mountain Park website. It was easy and straightforward. Just have to pick one of the time slots that is available on the day that you choose, pay your money, and sign the waiver. At the time of this writing, the cost to do the zip line is $29 (USD) per person, not including credit card processing fees. There are some physical and age requirements that you have to meet in order to be able to do the zip line. Be sure that you read about those before making your reservation. Day of the Hike In order to get to the zip line adventure, you have to hike in from the parking lot, to the main office (which is a metal shipping container), to a secondary check-in point (which is another shipping container), and then to the Kaul Tower. I estimate that the total walk time was about 15-20 minutes. Once at the tower, you will be given a full body harness and helmet to wear. Climb the Tower To get to the zip line platform, you have to climb the tower from the inside. The tower is approximately 80 feet high. it has a very tight winding combination of steps and ladders. The steps are very steep and the ladders have nets that will catch you if you fall. The ladders resemble wood pallets. Prepare for Launch Once at the top, you'll have to wait until you are called up to the platform. Only two riders are allowed on the platform at a time as it is a small space. You will be connected zip line cable and given instructions on how to get off the platform. For me, the instructions given, varied from my actual experience. I am 6 feet tall. Before you launch, you are advised to squat down into your harness and make your way to the edge of the platform. If you are shorter, the harness will start pulling on you in the squatting position and the weight of your body will be on the zip line cable. Because I am taller, the harness did not start pulling on me until I went off of the platform. That being said, the initial second or two after coming off of the platform, felt like a free fall jump. Scary! Zip Away Next comes the fun part. Zip lining for 1000 feet. The wind will definitely get in your face. I did this during the winter season, so there were not mosquitoes out and about. However, in the summer months, you will want to consider wearing sunglasses as the last thing that you want to happen is a bug slamming into your eye at 30 miles per hour. As you get closer to the end of the zip-line, you will pass the dismount platform and gravity will slow you down and send you back towards the dismount platform. You will zip forward again to the dismount platform where the staff will help you get off the line and back onto the ground. Again I Say! Again! If you choose, you can go a second time. The second time, they will let you go backwards on the zip line if you choose. The first time, they do not let you go backwards as they want to adapt to the experience of zip-lining. I chose to go backwards the second time. There is definitely a difference going backwards as you cannot see what is coming up, but you do see the tower that you launch from fade off in the distance. Hiking Trails There are approximately 15 miles of hiking trails in the park. Some of the trails have overview or lookout points were you can get a greater view of the park and of the city of Birmingham. A lot of people had their dogs walking with them on the trails. There were also bike riders present. If you do choose to ride a bike at the park, be sure to ride a mountain bike and not a road bike as none of the trails are paved. The more popular trails do have a gravel surface, but the other trails are only dirt. There are trail maps at various locations in the park. The trails are marked with 4x4 inch markers mounted to the trees next to the trail. Each trail has a number and a color scheme so that you know what trail that you are on. When you come to some of the trail intersections, there is a trail marker, similar to the old concrete street signs, that denote which trail continues in which direction. These markers are noted as being done by a local Boy Scout troop in 2016. Old Iron Mines This park is situated in Southwest Birmingham. Back in the late 1800 and early 1900s, iron ore was dug out from the mountain and used to make steel. As you may know, during the Industrial Age, Birmingham, Alabama was known as the \"Pittsburgh of the South\" as it was producing comparable amounts of steel and iron as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Those mines are now abandoned and sealed, but are still in place. As part of this adventure to the park, I took a hike over to the Ishkooda #14 Mine. As you may can tell from the above and below picture, there are some rocks and dirt that has a pink-ish color to it. That coloring is the iron ore mixed in with the dirt. There was not much to see at this particular mine, but you could see a little bit into the mine via the Manway whole as it was not tightly sealed. Conclusion Overall I had a good experience and would go back to the park again, to hike on some of the other trails and to do some of the other adventures that they have available. If you are interested in visiting the Red Mountain Park, you can check out their website . I did not receive any sponsorship or compensation for this post.

There was not much to see at this particular mine, but you could see a little bit into the mine via the Manway whole as it was not tightly sealed.","title":"Old Iron Mines"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.02.19-mega-zip-at-red-mountain-park/#conclusion","text":"Overall I had a good experience and would go back to the park again, to hike on some of the other trails and to do some of the other adventures that they have available.

This post is solely my opinion of the activities that I have described.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve-handyman/","text":"The toilet in the bathroom, I discovered that the toilet was continuously running. When my place was quiet, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom. It was not loud. I removed the lid of the tank and to my suprise the water was at the top of the overflow tube. Definitely not a good sign. Not sure how long it had that slow leak, but I wanted to fix it before it got worse. I immediately shut off the water to the toilet to prevent any more water from being wasted. I have other bathrooms that I was able to use, so I was not concerned with this one leaking. However, if you only have one toilet and choose to turn the water off, you will need to turn it on after each flush so that it can refill. I'll share with you the 8 steps that I took to replace the fill valve on a toilet. 1) Gather The Tools Needed In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional) 2) Shut Off The Water Before you do anything, turn off the water. If you do not turn off the water before disconnecting the hoses or the fill valve, then you will flood your bathroom. To turn off the water, you can turn it off at the shut off valve on the left side of the toilet. If you do not have a shut off valve next to the toilet, then you will have to turn off the water to the entire home. This shut off valve could be located either outside or in the basement of the home. Once you have located the shut off valve, turn the knob to the right until it stops. 3) Remove the Water Remove the lid from the toilet tank (aka the back of the toilet). Flush the toilet and hold the lever down until most or all of the water runs out. Then you will need to remove the remaining water using one of the following methods: use a towel to soak up the water and wring it out in the bowl or sink allow the water to evaporate (the method I chose); this may take a couple of weeks to happen Jump to step 5 and replace a bucket below the fill valve opening before you unscrew it 4) Purchase Replacement Parts You will need to get a replacement fill valve. I bought a universal one, similar to the one pictured above. It has the same size fitting that connects to the water supply line. I also bought a replacement supply line. You do not have to do this. However, in the past 4 years, I have replaced almost all of the working parts of this toilet. Thus going ahead to replace the supply line as I do not know how long ago it was replaced. 5) Remove Old Fill Valve and Supply Line I disconnected the supply line from the water line and the fill valve. You may have to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the line. If the water line (that is the pipe that comes out of the wall) has Teflon tape on it, you will want to remove it at this time. Teflon tape is white, but pay be discolored depending on how long it has been on the fitting. Then I removed the fill valve from the tank, by removing the nut that is located on the bottom side of the tank. I was kinda suprised that this had not started leaking sooner. If you notice at the bottom of this valve, the rubber gasket has significantly warped to the point that it was no longer in its original shape. 6) Install New Fill Valve and Supply Line The fill valve that I purchased, has an adjustable height. Per the instructions listed on the box, I the fill valve needs to be 3 inches higher than the overflow tube. Following the instructions on the box, I adjusted the height of the valve to the approximate height that it needed to be. Do not use pilers or tools when tightening plastic parts. Do not use pilers or tools when tightening plastic parts. I say this twice because it really is important. The reason being is that you risk stripping or breaking the plastic parts. Plastic parts are usually designed to be hand-tightened only. If you break a plastic part, there is a chance that you will not be able to buy the broken part by itself, thus wasting money. What I did not realize until after the fact, was that the fill valve that I removed also had an adjustable height. Coincidentally, I set the new fill valve to the same height as the old fill valve that I removed. Before installing the new supply line, put on new Teflon tape. The reason that the Teflon tape is used to fill the gap that may exist between two connections or fittings. It is especially recommended that it be used on metal to metal fittings as they may leak of the rubber gasket is not seated properly. I only put the Teflon tape on the metal fittings. However, you can use it on the plastic fittings as well. 7) Turn On The Water Once you have checked and double checked the connections, slowly turn on the water. If you turn on the water slowly, then you are less likely to have a flood if a leak springs. Furthermore, if you turn the water knob 5 times and then find a leak, you have to turn it in the opposite direction 5 times to stop the water. Flush the toilet several times to make sure that the fill valve works as it should. 8) Adjust the Fill Rate This particular fill value has adjustable knobs for the tank water level and the bowl water level. Be sure to adjust these accordingly so that you are not wasting water by overfilling. Conclusion This was a rather quick replacement. In total, it took about an hour to complete. Part of that was having to walk back and forth to get tools and supplies. Also testing repeatedly to make sure that it works as it should.","title":"8 Steps to Replace A Toilet Fill Valve"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve-handyman/#1-gather-the-tools-needed","text":"In order to complete the job, you will need the following: towel(s) bucket or bowl (optional) pliers replacement fill valve replacement supply line (optional) Teflon tape (optional)","title":"1) Gather The Tools Needed"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.03.15-8-steps-to-replace-a-toilet-fill-valve-handyman/#2-shut-off-the-water","text":"Before you do anything, turn off the water.

This bedroom did not have a ceiling fan originally, just a standard light fixture. Remove the Existing Fixture The removal was fairly easy. To begin, I had the customer turn off the power to the fixture. Come to find out, the entire room was on a single breaker. I confirmed using a non-contact voltage tester that the circuit no longer had power. Next was the removal of the cover plate and the disconnecting of the wires that powered the fan and light. Confirm Fan Rated Junction Box Next step was to confirm that a junction box, that was rating for a ceiling fan was already installed. This is what the junction box looked like. This is a newer style of junction box that is in contact with the joist on the bottom and side of the joist. Normally the junction box is only in contact with the bottom of the joist or is the retrofit style that extends to connect to the two nearby joists. This style of junction box, has the fan connected directly to the joist in the ceiling instead of connecting to the box and then the box to the joist. Install the Ceiling Fan Due to the height of the ceiling, a downrod was used to lower the ceiling fan closer to the living space of the room. Ceiling fans come with a downrod that is designed for a 8 foot ceiling. If you ceiling is greater than this height, then the use of a longer down rod is recommended. The length of the down rod depends on the height of the ceiling. From this point forward, the ceiling fan installation was straightforward and followed the manufacturer's instructions. This particular ceiling fan comes with some of the screws already in their final installation place. This reduces the chances of you putting a screw in the wrong part of the fan and the amount of plastic that has to be used to package the parts. Conclusion Installing a ceiling fan is a simple and easy process as long as the electrical and mounting steps are doing correctly.","title":"Ceiling Fan Installation with Downrod"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.07.12-ceiling-fan-installation-with-downrod-handyman/#background","text":"I received a request to install a ceiling fan.

She requested that I perform the work. The initial discussion was about replacing a shrub, but expanded into doing more. As you can see, couple of the bushes had died and had been overtaken by weeds and grass. Per the conversation with the customer, a lawn care company (I am not going to mention the name) sprayed something on the bushes that was supposed to help them, but instead resulted in some of them dying. In addition, grass had started to grow up inside of the bed. Customer had used plastic bags as a weed barrier when she initially set up the bed. Also the lawn care professional that the customer uses, would sometimes cut too close to the bed. As a result, some of the rocks would be launched into the yard, sidewalk, or other location that they should not be. I suggested that brick pavers be used as a barrier to prevent this from happening going forward as nobody would be willing to run over bricks with a lawn mower as it could potentially destroy the mower. For the weed control, I recommended that landscape fabric be put down to prevent or hinder future weeds from growing, and using more lava rock as a mulch for the bed. Materials Used Materials used for this project were: Brick pavers Lava rock Landscape fabric one bush/shrub Remove Old Landscaping The old landscaping was removed. This included a combination of leaves, lava rock, and the black plastic weed barrier. The plan was that the lava rock be separated from the other materials in the bed. However, that proved to be a bit more difficult in execution. The existing rock, leaves, and weeds were raked, shoveled, and placed onto a tarp. In addition, the dead bushes were removed. One of the bushes was replaced with a new one. Install New Landscaping Before the landscape fabric was installed, all purpose fertizilzer was used to help the existing and new plants. The living shrubs were left in place. Since they were left, the landscape fabric was installed and cut to fit around the existing bushes. This would allow for the greatest amount of coverage to prevent weeds and grass from showing up in the beds. The old landscaping was removed and placed on the tarp. As you can see from the picture above, the rocks were used to keep the fabric from blowing away, granted there was much wind during the project. Lock In The Pavers Each over the pavers were placed on a layer of fast setting concrete. This will help hold the pavers in place. Since the ground is mostly level, leveling the bricks did not take too much effort. In some areas, the ground was slightly higher. Those areas, were dug down using a shovel and pickaxe. Then the dirt was compacted down using a tamper to make sure it did not settle once the brick was placed on top of it. Once the pavers were in place, they were watered so that the concrete could set up. Because the concrete is directly on the ground, the concrete will soak up water from the ground, in addition to the rain water. I got the idea for the no dig border from watching a YouTube video . As I mentioned, I did have to do some digging in order to get the bricks as level as possible. In some spots, getting them level was not possbile as the ground sloped downward (for drainage). Conclusion In the end the lava rock was added and below is the final outcome of the project. As you can see, the landscape has been cleaned up. In addition, the weeds were removed, and the customer should no longer have issues with rocks in the yard after the grass is cut.","title":"Front Yard Landscaping"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.07.21-front-yard-landscaping-handyman/#background","text":"Customer wanted to update the look on her front yard.

The problem that I had is that I did not have anywhere to store the items so that they could properly dry out to be used in the firepit. Thus I built a firewood stand that would hold the wood until they were ready to be burned. What You Need Materials Needed 4 - 4 inch x 4 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 10.16 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated posts 3 - 4 inch x 2 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 5.08 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards 3 - 4 inch x 1 inch x 12 feet (10.16 cm x 2.54 cm x 3.65 m) pressure treated boards exterior or deck screws or nails spray paint All of the parts that are used to build the stand are not included as I took this picture in the process of unloading the materials. Tools Needed Saw - miter saw makes this easier, but circular saw works for this as well drill Cut The Pieces Vertical Posts I made my stand 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. To get this height, I cut the 4 inch x 4 inch posts in half. Horizontal Pieces I made the stand 4 feet (1.22 m) long by 2 feet (0.61 m) wide. I used 2 of the the 4 inch x 2 inch lumber cut at 4 feet, 4 feet, and then 2 feet. The remaining 4 x 2 will be used as cross braces between the outer pieces. The cross braces were placed at 16 on center. Slats I did not cut the slats until after I had completed the assembly. That way, they would be cut to fit the shelving that was used. I had some pallet wood on hand, so I was able to use that instead of using 1x4 wood. Paint The Pieces I painted the bottom and tops of the vertical posts with spray paint. Since I was placing the firewood stand directly in contact with the ground, I wanted some protection against the water that it would be in contact with. Paint is not necessary the best way to prevent the wood from rotting, but it does offer better protection than setting the posts directly on the ground. I went up about 1 foot from the bottom of the post and painted it as well. The reason that I did this because when water hits the ground, it may splash up on the side of the post. Having paint up this far will provide protection against this splashing. I had black spray paint already on hand, so I used it. Regardless of which paint that you use, make sure that you use exterior grade paint. Exterior grade paint will offer you the best protection for the wood. Assemble The Pieces For my setup, I made the top of the bottom shelf 1 foot (0.30 m) from the ground. This will allow for sufficient air flow for all of the wood that has been stacked on it. The top shelf is about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the top of the post. This will make sure that the items that are on the top do not easily roll off when they are stacked. Pieces were secured together with 3 inch decking screws. I mentioned in the materials list, you may use nails for this as well. Conclusion This project was simple and only took a couple of hours to complete. As you can see from the photo, if you need to make it bigger or smaller to fit your space, then you can change the size of the horizontal pieces as necessary.

Since I was placing the firewood stand directly in contact with the ground, I wanted some protection against the water that it would be in contact with. Paint is not necessary the best way to prevent the wood from rotting, but it does offer better protection than setting the posts directly on the ground. I went up about 1 foot from the bottom of the post and painted it as well. The reason that I did this because when water hits the ground, it may splash up on the side of the post. Having paint up this far will provide protection against this splashing. I had black spray paint already on hand, so I used it. Regardless of which paint that you use, make sure that you use exterior grade paint.

Come to find out, one of the wires had burned off on the contactor, which resulted in a hot house in August. Definitely not something good. Take a look at the video to see how I diagnosed and fixed the issue. Video Transcript (Unedited) ONE DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NEXT YOU'RE

replace the contactor on my air conditioner after the last one had a burned wire on it. I discuss the parts of a contactor and how it works. Check out the video! Video Transcript (Unedited) what's going on fellow engineers this is Kenny and thanks for checking out the Almost Engineer Channel and in this video I'm going to talk about a contactor this thing right here and how it works stay tuned Music alright so this is the contactor that I took off of my HVAC unit and this is the old one so I just wanted to talk about what a contactor is and what it does and how it works and so there are some elements on here that are not exactly right with a modern contactor this one is probably original to the HVAC unit that I have so there are some differences that I notice between the new one and the old one alright folks so I got my new contactor which is this one over here and my old contactor which is this one here for the most part they are pretty much the same the screw on this one actually I had to screw it all the way out to get the lead out of there so but there are some significant differences that I'm noticing so on the top of this one actually you stick the wire in whereas this one had a clamp that you put a connector on it and then you put that connector around the screw head so the top is essentially like the bottom now where you stick the whole wire in and then you screw to clamp it down all the way also the same number of pins here looks to be there's eight on the bottom and there's eight on the top here I only had I believe it was two wires here and this one also is enclosed so as you can see you can see the coil on this one both sides so but you can on this one and the reason being is somebody actually took the counts that hey bugs can actually get into this thing and cause problems so what they do now is they actually seal it up entirely so all this mechanical stuff like this right here is not exposed to the elements however you can take these two screws off and this play to come up and then it will look just like this inside underneath this cover here so that's the difference between the new contactor and the old contactor and so with this particular contactor unit so we'll start off with the label of course and here you'll see is rated for 25 amps and it's also a 24 volt coil and so the contactor that I put on is actually rated for 30 amps but it's also 24 volts and so what the amperage has to do is that it has a maximum capacity you know you see it as 25 so if you try to push 30 through it more likely you'll have a problem and I think that kind of helped in some cases the failure of this one and so if you see right here where this screw is you'll see this plastic here is actually burned and cracked it actually broke off what happened there was it looks like the wire on it actually broke burned some kind of way I don't know if something got into it and caused it to short out or what the case was but this is the connector that was on it after the fact from the wire way it burned off at so and as you see this screw is actually brown so I don't know if that is the indicator of the problem that was going on with it because it should not have been brown it should be fight the rest of these you know silver we're not so just a walk overview of everything so on the bottom here have pins you can have these push connectors that go on these pins here at the bottom then you also have these two terminal screws and so you can stick the wire in this gap here tighten the screw down same thing on this side and then on the top it's a different setup because they actually use these connectors that go over the screw and then you tighten screw down on the connector instead of sticking the wire directly in so that's that side and this is what is known as a single pole breaker and there's also a thing called a double pole breaker so the pole is the thing that actually moves so this one here is not seized up it does move but it only has one pole which is this side so this right side here as you see there's a metal bar that goes from top to bottom that means this side is always hot this side is the side that switches so we turn on the AC U and it this goes in and it connects the bottom which is where the power comes in that to the top which is where it goes out to the compressor and the fan on the condenser unit and completes the circuit so sue Evans so fan is running but there's no I don't hear the compressor running too and so that's how that works now how does this move back and forth well on this side and on this side you have these two connectors as well these since this is a 24 volt coil these connect to the 24 volt wires that come from the inner handler that is on the building interior so when there is a call for cooling the thermostat connects the wires inside of it and that signal goes to the air handler the air handler triggers that same since that signal out to the condenser through one side and then back out the other therefore you complete the circuit and when you complete the circuit on here this pushes in and completes the 240 circuit so if you ever heard me discuss about relays before this is essentially the same concept as a relay you have a voltage of one type in this case would be in 24 volts controlling a voltage of a higher type which in this case is 240 volts that's 120 on the Left 120 on the right which equals 240 now this one may or may not say it I do not believe it does but it is designed for 240 but it doesn't say it the unit itself says 240 the actual conditioner unit says 240 on it so and then once you remove the 24 volts so the thermostat says hey I've reached the set temperature shut off so that means the thermostat disconnects the connection between the air handler and it and so as a result that same connection is also removed so the incoming 24 volts is removed from here and thus there's nothing on this side to go back so this connector in the middle here will spring up and there is a spring underneath it as you can kind of see right there there's a spring there and so that comes back up to disconnect the connector connection between the top of the bottom so that covers how a contactor works hopefully you've learned a little bit and are able to apply this in the future if you have any questions about the contactor or relay please hit me up and drop a comment in the comment section below also please check out me on social media on Instagram and Twitter at almost Engr and check out my website the

amps but it's also 24 volts and so what the amperage has to do is that it has a maximum capacity you know you see it as 25 so if you try to push 30 through it more likely you'll have a problem and I think that kind of helped in some cases the failure of this one and so if you see right here where this screw is you'll see this plastic here is actually burned and cracked it actually broke off what happened there was it looks like the wire on it actually broke burned some kind of way I don't know if something got into it and caused it to short out or what the case was but this is the connector that was on it after the fact from the wire way it burned off at so and as you see this screw is actually brown so I don't know if that is the indicator of the problem that was going on with it because it should not have been brown it should be fight the rest of these you know silver we're not so just a walk overview of everything so on the bottom here have pins you can have these push connectors that go on these pins here at the bottom then you also have these two terminal screws and so you can stick the wire in this gap here tighten the screw down same thing on this side and then on the top it's a different setup because they actually use these connectors that go over the screw and then you tighten screw down on the connector instead of sticking the wire directly in so that's that side and this is what is known as a single pole breaker and there's also a thing called a double pole breaker so the pole is the thing that actually moves so this one here is not seized up it does move but it only has one pole which is this side so this right side here as you see there's a metal bar that goes from top to bottom that means this side is always hot this side is the side that switches so we turn on the AC U and it this goes in and it connects the bottom which is where the power comes in that to the top which is where it goes out to the compressor and the fan on the condenser unit and completes the circuit so sue Evans so fan is running but there's no I don't hear the compressor running too and so that's how that works now how does this move back and forth well on this side and on this side you have these two connectors as well these since this is a 24 volt coil these connect to the 24 volt wires that come from the inner handler that is on the building interior so when there is a call for cooling the thermostat connects the wires inside of it and that signal goes to the air handler the air handler triggers that same since that signal out to the condenser through one side and then back out the other therefore you complete the circuit and when you complete the circuit on here this pushes in and completes the 240 circuit so if you ever heard me discuss about relays before this is essentially the same concept as a relay you have a voltage of one type in this case would be in 24 volts controlling a voltage of a higher type which in this case is 240 volts that's 120 on the Left 120 on the right which equals 240 now this one may or may not say it I do not believe it does but it is designed for 240 but it doesn't say it the unit itself says 240 the actual conditioner unit says 240 on it so and then once you remove the 24 volts so the thermostat says hey I've reached the set temperature shut off so that means the thermostat disconnects the connection between the air handler and it and so as a result that same connection is also removed so the incoming 24 volts is removed from here and thus there's nothing on this side to go back so this connector in the middle here will spring up and there is a spring underneath it as you can kind of see right there there's a spring there and so that comes back up to disconnect the connector connection between the top of the bottom so that covers how a contactor works hopefully you've learned a little bit and are able to apply this in the future if you have any questions about the contactor or relay please hit me up and drop a comment in the comment section below also please check out me on social media on Instagram and Twitter at almost Engr and check out my website the almost

Get out of Your comfort zone. Mental Matters Live! - 2020.08.22 @mentalmatterspodcast This one was not a presentation. It was more of an open discussion with the show hosts and attendees should have a solid top 5 people that You can go to for advice or assistance when You have a crisis In Your relationships, You have to find the balance between You and Your partner Everyone is not Your friend. While You have gone through the same situations and challenges, that doesn't mean that they are friends. They can be acquaintances though A therapist are not fixers. The therapist is there to sort out the confusion. You ultimately have to fix Your problem sometimes we need to have folks that will check us when we are about to make mistakes be genuine to Yourself and impact those that are around You You have to know sometimes that it is best to cut things off instead of trying to sustain them as a difficult situation Be happy for the success of others Men have a tendency to be tough and not really be vulnerable about what's really bothering them When others say that they're fine, ask them \"are they sure?\" That can change the context of the conversation. Schedule conversations with people just to make sure that they are good. how do You manage Your relationships with Your friends when they start relationships with new people? You have to have the conversation that things will change because of their new relationship. Should be able to have those tough conversations, for the benefit for sustaining the relationship disagreement does not equate to disrespect Let Your words be Your hands. Know when to throw them, know when to use them.","title":"NSBE 46th National Convention - Engineering the Revolution"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020.08.20-nsbe-46-engineering-the-revolution/#background","text":"This convention was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus.

After growing something in the garden for several years, I figured that it was time to give it a break. Observations Things like onion chives and garlic chives have managed several frosts that have occurred during the winter. This two herbs are both in a raised bed and a pots. The onion plant did create seeds last year, so those will probably self plant themselves and grow more onion plants this year as I did not collect the seeds. Pine Mulch In 2019, I used Pine mulch in the garden. Laid it on thick. What I eventually found out was that the pine mulch can change the acidity of the soil. Given that I had put a lot of it down, I think it really changed the acidity of the soil. Reason I say this is because things that would normally grow without much difficulty, such as tomatoes, were struggling to keep afloat. I thought about, but never did, get a soil test done to confirm this theory. A lot of the signs were present. In 2020, I turned that mulch into the soil in addition to adding amendments to the soil to give the plants what they need to be successful. I did see a better outcome in 2020 because of this and have learned a valuable lesson in doing so. Hackberry Trees I used the winter time of the year, to cut down some trees that were along the property line. These trees are called Hackberry Trees. In 2017, I had one split. It the split portion of the tree fell over into my yard. In 2019, there was another Hackberry Tree that split. This time it split over into the neighbor's yard. I have also had branches randomly break off and split from other Hackberry Trees. The reason that I wanted to cut the trees was because: they block a lot of the southern and western sunlight from reaching the garden during the summer time. wanted to reduce the chance of having another tree splitting and landing in the neighbors yard. there were two many trees along the property line. Thus wanted to thin them out as some of them had their growth stunted by other trees. In total, I cut two trees down. One was about 25 feet (7.62 meters) tall, the other about 20 feet (6.096 meters) tall. After cutting them down into managable pieces, they will be placed on the firewood stand that I built to dry and eventually be burned in the firepit. In the later summer of 2020, I cut down 3 Hackberry Trees. Unfortunately, I got multiple bites, from what I believe were spider bites, and had to seek treatment for those bites as they severely itched. Figured the winter season, would kill them off and less like to have that happen again. Hackberry Trees Splitting What I found from doing some internet research, it is very common for Hackberry Trees to split where to or more branches meet. The reason being is that the meeting point for the branches have a tendency to develop into a bowl shape instead of like the peak of a roof. This bowl shape, holds water and over time the water rots out the branch. Once enough rot has formed, the weight of the branch causes the branch to break or, in my case, the tree to split in half do to the weight of the branches. Collard and Mustard Greens I still have collard greens in the garden. These greens were planted around late 2018 and have gone to seed and kept growing. This is not normal behavior as the other collard greens that were planted in the raised beds and in containers have died off after they went to seed. I also have some mustard greens that are starting to grow now. I assume these are from the seeds that fell off the previously growing plants. I will probably dig them up before they get too big and put them in one of the growing beds so that they have a better chance of surviving the upcoming growing season. 2021 Growing Plans This year and I plan on sticking with some of the same veggies that I have grown in the past, such as bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, garlic chives, onion chives, and mint. Want to add more fruits this year, but not sure which ones as tomatoes usually draw some bugs that I'm not familiar with and are difficult to get rid of. Also want to be better about documenting about what is going on in the garden this year. This will allow me to better keep track of past experiences and share those experiences with others.","title":"Starting the Garden for Spring 2021"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.02.09-starting-the-garden-for-spring/#observations","text":"Things like onion chives and garlic chives have managed several frosts that have occurred during the winter.

While in the garden today, I noticed that some of the greens that I had planted last year in containers, were now growing on the ground. The seeds had fallen off their parent plants and taken root. Why Move Plants During the winter time, these collards were in a different location and I moved them to a shady-er (IDK if that's a word) spot so that they would receive less sunlight as the summer season approached. As the seasons change, the amount of sunlight that reaches a given spot will also change. That being said, all plants do not need the same amount of sunlight to grow. Frost tolerant vegetables like collard greens and kale, will do fine with about 4 hours of direct sunlight. Non-frost tolerant vegetables, like tomatoes and bell peppers, need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. My yard is shaded heavily during the summer afternoons and evenings because of a wall of trees that are on the fence line. In the Winter time, the leaves on these trees fall off, allowing more sunlight into the yard. Take this into consideration when determining where you want to place your plants. Testing Growing Areas I haven't grown much on the side of the house where I moved the containers. As a result, I will see how well the collard greens that self-planted, will do in this location. This particular location, only gets direct morning sunlight and is shaded the rest of the day. When it comes to collard greens, this may do them good during the summer time, as greens will usually \"bolt\" (meaning gone to seed) during the hotter temperatures and longer daylight. If this shady location does well for the greens, I may go with setting up a grow bed on this side of the house. Conclusion My 2021 growing season is off to a great start. How so? Because I have not put in any work, and the garden is already producing.","title":"Growing Without Planting Seeds"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.02.26-growing-without-planting-seeds/#why-move-plants","text":"During the winter time, these collards were in a different location and I moved them to a shady-er (IDK if that's a word) spot so that they would receive less sunlight as the summer season approached.

what's going on fellow engineers today i actually have a handy job and so i'm going to be showing you uh some of the details related to that job i have my tools already loaded up and about head to head out this particular job is for a tv mounting this tv mounting i'm not going to actually do video of me actually installing that inside the customer's house because i don't like to do that usually i'll just take pictures so i'll discuss like the steps i do as i'm mounting it with the pictures that i'll show you coming up all right i have pulled up to the customer's house so the next part of the process is i check in on the handy app to let the handy though as well as the customer know that i have arrived at their location all right so what we have here is a tv install this is the tv that the customer wanted to install he has like a workout space if you will a workout room and uh this is a tcl i believe it is as you see here it is a 32 inch smart cv and he wanted it mount on the wall that way when he works out you know you can turn it on move it away from the wall do what you got to do then when you're done turn it off so be it uh also with this tv he provided the on the tv mount as you see from this is the instruction manual it is a 32 to 47 inch mount but is a single mount so it literally mounts to a single stud on the wall and it's also a mount that articulates so it can be moved in and out and the tv you know twist turned rather you know left or right to position it where it needs to be positioned all right the first step in this was to you had to it came with a template the mount that is and you had to drill three holes on the wall to mount the three bolts that would eventually come in that's in a future step uh the what i did i had to use my stud finder to locate where the stud was on the wall and so once i found that stud i like i said drill the holes there because this room is at a a rather different angle this wall that is being mounted to is a full wall i believe this wall was eight no excuse me maybe nine or ten feet but on the other side of where this wall is is actually a knee wall so if you're not familiar knee walls are usually a short vertical wall three to four feet high and then the remaining height of that wall is a sloped angle which is the back side of the roof and so positioning it where it was and trying to get it in between you know essentially a angle like this where you have the vertical wall on this side and then the slope group on this side and to get it high enough so that if the tv is out you can walk underneath it and not hit your head but also not too high that it bumps the wall over here on the the sloped wall or sloped ceiling if you will so that was a little bit of challenge i measured it probably about three or four times and even when i measured it though several times i wasn't 100 sure that i actually got it in the right spot but i managed to do so so after that uh the three holes are in the wall the next step is to mount the bracket onto the back of the tv and so this also came in the bracket that is came with the tv mount and also these four screws here and depending on this tv because it accepts so many sizes you see there are multiple holes here and it actually has some extension arms that came in the kit that allow you to attach for even bigger tvs but because this is the smallest size that this mount will accommodate i didn't need all of that extra hardware so i was able to use the four screws on the actual plate itself alright the next part i mounted the mount to the wall and as you see those three holes that i drilled earlier are where the three bolts are at and pay attention because some mounts do have like arrows of how those mounts are supposed to be installed and as you see here this mount actually has a up arrow because this is supposed to be in the up direction because the actual where the the back plate on the tv connects to this mount is designed to only work one way so if you install it upside down the tv won't stay on so pay attention pay attention pay attention oftentimes they the manual will also mention whether the mount should be a right side up or upside down or if it if you can even install it upside down but like i say pay attention now if you notice this kind of this hole here is not straight centered into the opening and the reason being is because well i put the level onto the side of the mount itself because sometimes you may not drill exactly center into the stud that happens you know a little bit of user error in there sometimes and it could also be the fault of stud finder because all stuff finders are not a hundred percent accurate all the time that being said though this one is like i said it's not square center in here but the mount itself was vertical you know 100 level because i put the level on it once i got the top bolt in then i put the level on it and moved it over as it needed to be so that it remained level and then secure the bolt in place all right now here's a different angle for the mounts the top and bottom bolts have covers that go over there that way you don't see them when the tv is moved away from the wall the middle one doesn't because i think the way they designed it they would think hey if you're going to put this tv on the wall that middle mount is not i mean that middle screw is not as significant to be seen so there was no cover for that one you can also see that i've mounted the tv here and up here is two screws that actually secure the mounting plate which is this right here to the mount itself and the top half doesn't even actually have bolts in it it just has this kind of like a hook like this and so the arm just sits on top of that and so that's how the top of it is held in and then as i mentioned the bottom part is held in with these two screws here and here is the final a different view of the final installation so as you see and here there is this angle uh slope of the ceiling as well as over here but it does fit in the space and it can be moved you know at any angle and here's a different angle of that room as you see again this is the this is the back side of the roof or the ceiling for this room because it does have knee walls so it's very of a very tight space i didn't run the cables down to the outlet the customer stated that he has some additional cables that he wanted to run and he wanted to get the they have this uh what they call like a wire channel and he wanted to get that and install that but he said he would do that himself so i left the plug off of there because there is no plug up here in this area the plug was uh directly below where this went so if it wasn't on this stud it may have been on the next stud over so he probably would have had to get like a surge protector or an extension cord of some sort to be able to run that distance in addition to being able to uh have enough slack in here so that he can move it in and out as need be when he's in the room and with that the tv install is completed as you saw the installation was in a fairly tight space but the customer is happy where it was placed because that is where he wanted it to be so i've now checked out the handy app and that completes this job so with this job in particular it was booked for two hours but i was able to finish it in roughly 45 minutes or so so when that happens handy still pays you for the full two hours because that is what the customer booked so you know the faster you work and you know of course if you book if you do it faster and get it right then you're hourly pay rate if you will essentially goes up so for that particular install i got i think it was paying 50 for the two hour period so because i did it faster than maybe i got 50 an hour so not bad for you know hours worth of work not including the drive time to and from the customer's house so that wraps it up for this video if you have any questions about handy drop the

hallway uh as you see here i have the doorbell box up here and you know i have white trim as you see over here on the right hand side and down here at the baseboards and the door but this doorbell box has this ugly tarnished yellow color so this video i'm going to show you how to paint this box to make it blend in with the rest of the environment Music so welcome to the channel if this is your first time checking out videos here just know i do videos every week one on tuesday for technology and videos on saturday for diy and handyman projects so if either of those topics interest you please be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button down below so this is my doorbell box um you know pretty basic uh my house was built in the late 70s so you know this has probably been up here since the house was built and i don't like this tan off-white color especially you know since i'm trying to like modernize things so the box just comes off fairly easy like literally you just pull it off it has these locking tabs in here like right there and right there that connect here and here and then there's two on the top there and so that's it so the next part is to go ahead and get this painted the next step is to get a some sandpaper or i have this on a sanding block and as you see it doesn't quite fit but that's what it is so sandpaper and what you want to do is rough up the surface if you don't have sandpaper you can also use some steel wool or copper wool it may take a little bit more effort to get this to work like sandpaper but it can still do the job and basic the concept that you want to go for is to scratch up the surface because when you go to paint this plastic surface you want the paint to stick to it therefore use sandpaper steel wool copper wool something abrasive that'll scratch up the surface all you're trying to do is to rough up the surface so that it's not shiny you know normally plastic has a shine to it so you want to try to remove that shine and that will allow the paint to stick and i'm only going to do the outside of the box because nobody's going to see the inside of the box unless they take the box off the wall once you have sanded the surface sufficiently just wipe off that excess dust i am using a tack cloth but if you don't have one of those you know if you know something similar paper towel with like alcohol on it or something of that nature can also do the same job then you want to get as you want to get all the dust off of here otherwise that dust will inhibit the paint from sticking to the surface all right now that that is done next step is to paint i just have white paint so that it can match the rest of the trim this paint has a paint and primer and it's designed for indoor and outdoors but obviously i'm using the indoor so it doesn't matter you don't necessarily need to have indoor and outdoor paint this just so happens to be able to do both um and depending on your box you may not even need the paint and primer you probably just need the paint but because paint and primer wasn't that much more expensive than just paint i got the paint and primer as always shake your spray paint can up before you use it and shake it while you're using it that's what the instructions say so just follow the instructions when it comes to applying this paint nothing special to it depending on the color change that you're trying to do like you're trying to go from like a black to a white you may have to do more than one or two coats to get that black to actually be white this should not be take too many more coats maybe two probably three and that's it so like i said check your paint and start applying it and make sure you're doing this i'm in my garage with the door open but you can also do this outside you don't want to do this indoors entirely because the fumes from the paint are they can cause you know you to become light-headed and all the other things so again open area outside or in a open garage and when you're spraying walk around and spray all of the angles don't try to do this or anything of that nature and the reason i say don't do it that way is because sometimes you'll spray but because you can't see what you're spraying you will miss part or of what you're trying to spray so just walk around it now even with this one coat on here as you can tell it's already made a difference in the appearance of it what i'm gonna do is let this dry according to the instructions on the can and then put another coat on top of here uh the kind of because i can see a little bit of the tan in here um that was originally part of the you know that's part of the original surface so i'm put another coat on top of that and then we'll go back and reinstall it and let you see the final product the doorbell box has now been reinstalled as you see it is white like some of the other items on the wall here and in my opinion i think it was better painted white than it did with that off-white tan looking color so if you think it looks better now than it did before drop a comment down below share your feedback on this particular project that will wrap things up for this video if

getting a pet. As most of you know, I do garden and have other hobbies in my spare time. However, the pet I was thinking of getting would have been more like a fish or a cat. Minding My Own Business Picture this... you come home and go check the mail. Nothing unusual about it, until you realize that there is a dog that you did not see all of a sudden following you to the mailbox. Now like most, my natural instinct was to tell the dog to go away and he initially did. As I moved to go in the house, he attempted to follow. Dog was very approachable. Where's Your Human? The dog looked like it was well cared, did not have a collar, and was not scared of me. Those clues lead me to believe that he may have been looking for help. I checked with my neighbor who has dogs and asked him if he had seen this one before, but he had not. I posted photos of him on Nextdoor, Facebook groups, and PawBoost but did not get any response from potential owners. I followed that up by calling the local humane society. They took a description of him as well as photos that I had taken of him and said that they would checked their lost records to see if someone had reported him missing. From discussions with other pet owners, I was told that if his human was looking for him, then they probably would have responded to the posts that I had made about him after about a day or two. If not responding to my post, they would have made their own post stating they were looking for him. Also took him to a local vet to see if he had a microchip. They scanned him and he did not have one. Since he did not have one, the vet that I took him to would not keep him. The humane shelter does take animals that do not have chips, but I was talked out of taking him there. Training The New Human This has definitely been a learning experience. Seeking advice from other dog owners, seeing what his habits are, and learning his food preferences are just some of the things that I have had to do. Learning how to understand an animal that cannot speak your language does require a different skillset. Here's what I have learned thus far. Food He does not like dry dog food. It at least needs to be wet or mixed with wet food. Found this out through trial and error. Initially when I tried to get him to eat, he sniffed the dry food and that was it. The next attempt, I hand fed him dry food and he ate a few more bites. Multiple people suggested that you mix the wet with the dry. Thus I have been doing that since. I have been plotting on building a pet feeder. That being said, wet food will not work well in a automated feeder and thus that automated feeder idea is still on the drawing board. From discussions, dry food is better for the dog than wet, because wet food has a tendency to stick to the dogs teeth. Who knew? I sure did not before that. Potty Trained Thankfully he is potty trained. He does not go in the house. When he does have to go, he sometimes will whimper like something is wrong. Thinking of maybe setting up some kind of bell or IOT device with buttons that he can press that will indicate what he needs instead of having to monitor the behavior and sounds. The word \"potty\" does register to him to handle his business while he is outside. Going on walks also trigger this to take place as well. I do have a robot vacuum that would run on schedule. Since the dog has been in the house, I have disabled the scheduled runs. For those of you that are wondering, I am aware of poopocalypse. The \"poopocalypse\" is where a dog poops inside and the robot vacuum runs over it throwing and smearing it all over the place. Not something that you want to have to clean up. No Toys Sometime ago, while digging in the garden, I found tennis ball. Tried to give the dog the tennis ball, but he was not feeling it. Bought a couple of other toys and he was not feeling them... at all. So much for entertainment. Walks He does enjoy walks. Often times, he is the one leading the way down the path. Only problem that I have noticed is that when walking in the neighborhood, he stops at every other mailbox to mark his territory. I don't mind the occasional stop, but when you are trying to get a walk in during a lunch break and still be able to eat, time is of the essence. Older Dog He is an older based on the gray hair around his feed and mouth and what others have mentioned. How old? not fully sure. That wisdom does make it easier to manage him as he does not have to be taught the very basics. Lap Dog My neighbor mentioned that because he always like to follow me around, to be snuggled next to me or in my presence, that he was probably a persons' lap dog. Furthermore, I am thinking that the dog probably was owned by somebody that was retired or always had a person at home. Given that, I will have to break him of that habit by going into rooms and closing the door and placing him in the kennel while I am working from home. Other Dogs When around other dogs, he practically ignores them, even if they are barking at him. Usually other dogs like to interact with each other, but this one is hesitant to do so. When in the backyard with my neighbors dog barking at him, he ignored it and continued to explore this new territory. Commands There are some commands that he does understand. Majority of the commands, he does not understand. Will probably do some training in order for him to learn more vocabulary and maybe the same commands in a different language. Barking He does not bark. Matter of fact, he did not bark at all until about day 2 with me. I have been training him to get used to me not being around by putting him into a different room from me. After some time, he got fed up with being isolated and started barking. He also occasionally barks at the robot vacuum when it is cleaning. I assume it is because it is not something that he has seen before. He has managed to stay clear of it when it runs. Conclusion Today is day 3 of having a dog. Oddly, it is also National Puppy Day. Of course I had no idea about this day since I am not a pet owner. It seems though that now I am a dog owner, as said by a number of people who have seen me with him. Since the dog did not have a collar, after talking with my significant other, he will henceforth be named \"Buddy\". Now to continue learning Buddy and his habits. If the owner does not come forth, then I will eventually get him taken to a vet to get checked out and see if he needs any treatments. Still haven't figured out what type of dog Buddy is. Based on his features and color, he's probably a mix between a rat terrier, mini pinscher, and one other breed.","title":"National Puppy Day 2021"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.03.23-national-puppy-day/#background","text":"I had been contemplating on getting a pet.

I posted photos of him on Nextdoor, Facebook groups, and PawBoost but did not get any response from potential owners. I followed that up by calling the local humane society. They took a description of him as well as photos that I had taken of him and said that they would checked their lost records to see if someone had reported him missing. From discussions with other pet owners, I was told that if his human was looking for him, then they probably would have responded to the posts that I had made about him after about a day or two. If not responding to my post, they would have made their own post stating they were looking for him. Also took him to a local vet to see if he had a microchip. They scanned him and he did not have one. Since he did not have one, the vet that I took him to would not keep him.

Different Chip Manufacturers In my previous post about the dog, I mentioned that Buddy did not have a chip according to a vet that I had took him too. Well, we went to another vet and come to find out, he does have a chip. The second vet has a universal chip reader and thus was able to pick it up. It is assumed that the first vet did not have a universal chip reader. After doing some reserach, the micro chip manufacturers do not use the same frequency for their chips. Thus if the reader that is used is not designed to read chips from multiple manufacters, then you will get a false negative. Dogs Are Picky About Food Buddy does not like dry dog food. He does like dry mixed with wet and dry with water added. From discussing with a neighbor who also has pets, his dogs are similar as they are picky about the food that they eat. Just based on the smell of the food, they will not eat it. This is similar to how humans that do not eat certain foods or only eat food that is cooked or prepared in a certain manner. Responding To Commands Buddy knew some of the commands that you would normally say to a dog. However, he still will ignore commands when distracted or scared (like during severe weather). I have noticed that there are some commands that he will respond to better than others. Sit vs Heel I would say \"sit\" and sometimes buddy would respond. Then I tried saying \"heel\" and he immediately followed the command. To a human, these words are basically synonyms. To a dog, these commands are not even related until they have been learned. Reason being is that dogs do not comprehend the language, nor communicate the language the same way that humans do. Watching Videos I have subscribed to some YouTube channels that talk about how to train your dog to respond to commands. Since this is new territory to me, learning from others that do this for a living or done this in the past would be the best teachers. Barking Triggers Buddy rarely barks. It will whipmer and do certain motions when he wants something, but definitely does not bark. Other Dog in Yard One day, Buddy was looking out the window. Out of nowhere he started barking and growling like something serious. Buddy does not normally bark, so clearly he had been triggered. Come to find out, a neighbor's dog had came over into our yard and started marking his territory. Buddy was not feeling that at all. After the dog left, Buddy was still bark and had to command him to \"relax\" so that he would stop barking. Squirrels Buddy got to go outside for a bathroom break. He saw some squirrels on top of the fence and let out a couple of barks. Those barks sent the squirrels running at high speed. Now my neighbor had told me about the squirrels and how they tease his dogs. Because this was the first time that the squirrels had seen a dog on my side of the fence, I believed that they were freaked out and did not wnat to stay around and try to tease him. Doorbells Believe it or not, Buddy does not bark when the doorbell rings. His ears would will go up and sometimes he will run to the door when you go to the door, but that is it. This was surprising behavior because most of the dogs I have seen lose it when the doorbell rings. I believe that his previous owners had him trained to not bark when the doorbell rings or they did not have a doorbell. No Toys Buddy has several toys. He does not play with any of them. On the rare occasion, he will play with a toy but if he does play with it, it would be for a short duration. Based on this assessment, I think that he did not play with toys with his previous owner or that he is well beyond the biting phase that most dogs have. The toys that we have bought, we will keep. That way he does have some entertainment for when he does choose to be playful. Conclusion As times goes on, the more I will learn. I will continuue to share about the new found knowledge that I acquire from being a pet parent.","title":"Becoming a Dog Parent"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.03.30-becoming-a-dog-parent/#different-chip-manufacturers","text":"In my previous post about the dog, I mentioned that Buddy did not have a chip according to a vet that I had took him too.

stuff you know handiwork and love diy this is one diy project that i wouldn't recommend for a lot of people this yes that's right that is a rat it's been going in and out of my attic for probably the last week and i set up a trap about a year and a half to maybe two years ago and the trap was still set and well let's just say said rat succumbed to its injuries um and as you can see it stuck his head in there and that head got gone like the wind [Music] what's going on fellow engineers thank you for checking out this video if this is your first time to the channel please be sure to consider to subscribe into the channel each week i have videos that talk about how to do technology or how to do diy projects so if you have any interest in that please be sure to subscribe this video as you saw in the opener i'm going to talk about the trex rat trap i actually have two traps so the one in this picture that i'm going to show is actually the tracks tricks rat trap and then the one that i actually have here is the tomcat rat snap trap they are both similar in nature because they both have are plastic and they have these teeth on so anything that gets caught in there is not going because the teeth as you see they interlock kind of like the teeth of an alligator so anything that gets in there like i said it gets caught so the particular rat that was in the attic it had been going in and out for about a week or two in the attic i do know that there are some opening holes and whatnot in the roof line and in some places in the fascia the previous homeowners they at one point while they lived here there were squirrels in the attic and there is plenty of evidence of squirrels being in the attic so it's kind of not surprising that a rat has managed to be able to get in the attic as well and so what i was able to do i set this trap in the attic like i said about a year two years prior to this taking place and the trap was actually still set and thus caught the rat i don't remember if i actually put bait in the trap or not um i'm thinking i probably did and that may have attracted it to it uh but yeah i'm kind of surprised myself that i was able to get this done you know in this way so to talk about this trap a little bit more like i mentioned it does have teeth on it this trap is made out of entire plastic like the whole construction with the exception of the spring that you may be able to see inside of there uh it's entirely plastic this spring and the retaining pin are the only parts on here that are metal so in terms of durability it it's pretty high up you can set it with one hand and the design of it allows you to set it and you don't end up snapping your fingers trying to set it you know most of those wood traps with the metal bar on them you have to hold the base of it the wooden part down and then you move the metal bar and then you have to put the trigger over and it requires both hands and if you're not careful when you're trying to set it you'll snap your finger under there and the smaller traps probably won't hurt if you snap your finger but the bigger ones that are probably the size of this trap that are with that metal bar will probably hurt your finger and uh in some cases you may actually get injured in the process um but this one it allows you to like i say set one hand all you gotta do is the back end of it just push down to the catches and it's set just that simple um so no snapping your fingers or anything of that nature the trigger and this particular trap is this black piece right here whoa good thing i have my thumb back there but this piece right here you press down and it releases and it snaps down and if you notice there's a thing in the middle here that thing in the middle is actually where your bait goes and so you can put peanut butter uh i think they suggested peanut butter or maybe like some fruit like raisins or something like that nature but it actually unscrews you just twist it out and it comes out of there at the bottom and then um you put whatever you want to in there as far as bait goes then you put it back in twist it in on the bottom right here and it's ready to go and so um this i i recommend this trap having that it actually stayed and caught a rat uh reasons being and i recommend it one it was set for over a year um most traps they won't stay set for that long sometimes because of the trigger is a little bit too sensitive so like you know a couple specks of dust land on it and it'll snap on its own um other traps you know they just through the expansion and traction of the springs through the heat and so forth they snap that way but this one did not so i was kind of surprised by that and i'm glad it actually did work the second reason that i would recommend this particular trap is because of the mechanism of how it keeps rats the teeth on here will grab and whatever it grabs is going to hold because of that teeth those wooden wraps with the metal bar there are stories of where the trap snapped and the rat because the trap was undersized for the animal that was trying to be captured um the the rat was actually just able to slide back out even though it hit him it didn't hit him in the right way where uh like it didn't hit him across the head it like hit like behind the head probably towards the back and so it was able to take that hit and then just slide his way out by using his legs to push on the wooden piece and slide out that those teeth on here you can push on here as hard as you want to but because those teeth actually kind of bite in and as you see the teeth are interlocking it doesn't let go this particular rat when it snapped now mind you i was asleep when it when it all happened and i kind of was freaked out in the middle of the night um but when it happened uh all i heard i woke up to like a just a beating like and it's like in the world is going on and so what i actually figured out and put two and two together with was that as you see this spot here doesn't have a lot of insulation on it and so i think what happened was the rat found the trap and stuck his head in there and when it snapped it tried to do like a barrel roll type deal to get out of the trap but because the rat you know that trap was not gonna let it go it it didn't let go and it just rolled and rolled the road and so the banging noise was the trap knocking on the back side of the draw wall that you see in this picture here so um yeah like i say you can fight it all you want to uh but or these the rats can fight it all they want to was not get out at all and so and i guess one of the main things about it is uh even when it snapped it didn't it didn't instantly kill the rat uh based on how i was able to see how it snapped on the head but it did contain a head and i really actually snapped the rat on his head it didn't even grab like the neck and so uh but because it grabbed the head and it wasn't able to go anywhere and then the hot temperatures that are in a typical attic um you know basically the rat suffocated uh from the hot temperatures if it didn't suffocate from the hot temperatures uh it suffocated from this pretty much cutting off the probably breeding that nature um the third reason i would recommend this particular trap is you actually have to look inside of the trap so if you see up here and i don't want to get a pen i don't want this to accidentally snap but if you see right in better yet i here get one you can actually see but if you see right in here there's a little spike kind of difficult to see there's a spike right here and so this spike actually lines up with the hole there you go this spike lines up with the hole where the bait goes in the trap and so what happens is if the when the trap snaps if the rat has its head in that place and the trap snaps the rat gets stabbed in the head so it's like instant death um when it happened in this particular scenario uh looking at the aftermath of it the head was slightly off of the opening so i'm thinking he probably was kind of skeptic at first maybe he managed to stick his head in i'm not fully sure but in either scenario the head was not square so he didn't die um but you know some traps do have that but this trap does have that set up so that your head in there die immediately um but it has to be in the right spot so that's kind of like the downside to it now to talk about some of the cons of this particular trap it is a little bit more expensive than the typical basic rat trap that has the metal base i mean excuse me the wooden base with the metal bars on it um those traps in my area run for about a dollar to a dollar and fifty us dollars that is and this particular trap runs from about seven to eight bucks us dollars so fairly more expensive but this trap is reusable it's designed to be reusable in part it is made out of plastic instead of like the cheaper wood and metal ones that you would get um and to be honest with you i would i i would since i have caught this rat and i do have two of these style of traps i'm going to actually go ahead and set these back in the attic uh again and who knows something else may manage to get up there but i'd rather have the traps up there and they never catch anything than to have critters running around and there's nothing that can catch them um so i know i i think this is a great investment in my opinion if you have any questions or comments you know or negative points that you bought this trap and didn't like about it feel free in the comments feel free to share those in the comments below um i'm willing to discuss that with you and any other questions that you may have so that will then wrap things up for this video i ask you to please give

the fascia the previous homeowners they at one point while they lived here there were squirrels in the attic and there is plenty of evidence of squirrels being in the attic so it's kind of not surprising that a rat has managed to be able to get in the attic as well and so what i was able to do i set this trap in the attic like i said about a year two years prior to this taking place and the trap was actually still set and thus caught the rat i don't remember if i actually put bait in the trap or not um i'm thinking i probably did and that may have attracted it to it uh but yeah i'm kind of surprised myself that i was able to get this done you know in this way so to talk about this trap a little bit more like i mentioned it does have teeth on it this trap is made out of entire plastic like the whole construction with the exception of the spring that you may be able to see inside of there uh it's entirely plastic this spring and the retaining pin are the only parts on here that are metal so in terms of durability it it's pretty high up you can set it with one hand and the design of it allows you to set it and you don't end up snapping your fingers trying to set it you know most of those wood traps with the metal bar on them you have to hold the base of it the wooden part down and then you move the metal bar and then you have to put the trigger over and it requires both hands and if you're not careful when you're trying to set it you'll snap your finger under there and the smaller traps probably won't hurt if you snap your finger but the bigger ones that are probably the size of this trap that are with that metal bar will probably hurt your finger and uh in some cases you may actually get injured in the process um but this one it allows you to like i say set one hand all you gotta do is the back end of it just push down to the catches and it's set just that simple um so no snapping your fingers or anything of that nature the trigger and this particular trap is this black piece right here whoa good thing i have my thumb back there but this piece right here you press down and it releases and it snaps down and if you notice there's a thing in the middle here that thing in the middle is actually where your bait goes and so you can put peanut butter uh i think they suggested peanut butter or maybe like some fruit like raisins or something like that nature but it actually unscrews you just twist it out and it comes out of there at the bottom and then um you put whatever you want to in there as far as bait goes then you put it back in twist it in on the bottom right here and it's ready to go and so um this i i recommend this trap having that it actually stayed and caught a rat uh reasons being and i recommend it one it was set for over a year um most traps they won't stay set for that long sometimes because of the trigger is a little bit too sensitive so like you know a couple specks of dust land on it and it'll snap on its own um other traps you know they just through the expansion and traction of the springs through the heat and so forth they snap that way but this one did not so i was kind of surprised by that and i'm glad it actually did work the second reason that i would recommend this particular trap is because of the mechanism of how it keeps rats the teeth on here will grab and whatever it grabs is going to hold because of that teeth those wooden wraps with the metal bar there are stories of where the trap snapped and the rat because the trap was undersized for the animal that was trying to be captured um the the rat was actually just able to slide back out even though it hit him it didn't hit him in the right way where uh like it didn't hit him across the head it like hit like behind the head probably towards the back and so it was able to take that hit and then just slide his way out by using his legs to push on the wooden piece and slide out that those teeth on here you can push on here as hard as you want to but because those teeth actually kind of bite in and as you see the teeth are interlocking it doesn't let go this particular rat when it snapped now mind you i was asleep when it when it all happened and i kind of was freaked out in the middle of the night um but when it happened uh all i heard i woke up to like a just a beating like and it's like in the world is going on and so what i actually figured out and put two and two together with was that as you see this spot here doesn't have a lot of insulation on it and so i think what happened was the rat found the trap and stuck his head in there and when it snapped it tried to do like a barrel roll type deal to get out of the trap but because the rat you know that trap was not gonna let it go it it didn't let go and it just rolled and rolled the road and so the banging noise was the trap knocking on the back side of the draw wall that you see in this picture here so um yeah like i say you can fight it all you want to uh but or these the rats can fight it all they want to was not get out at all and so and i guess one of the main things about it is uh even when it snapped it didn't it didn't instantly kill the rat uh based on how i was able to see how it snapped on the head but it did contain a head and i really actually snapped the rat on his head it didn't even grab like the neck and so uh but because it grabbed the head and it wasn't able to go anywhere and then the hot temperatures that are in a typical attic um you know basically the rat suffocated uh from the hot temperatures if it didn't suffocate from the hot temperatures uh it suffocated from this pretty much cutting off the probably breeding that nature um the third reason i would recommend this particular trap is you actually have to look inside of the trap so if you see up here and i don't want to get a pen i don't want this to accidentally snap but if you see right in better yet i here get one you can actually see but if you see right in here there's a little spike kind of difficult to see there's a spike right here and so this spike actually lines up with the hole there you go this spike lines up with the hole where the bait goes in the trap and so what happens is if the when the trap snaps if the rat has its head in that place and the trap snaps the rat gets stabbed in the head so it's like instant death um when it happened in this particular scenario uh looking at the aftermath of it the head was slightly off of the opening so i'm thinking he probably was kind of skeptic at first maybe he managed to stick his head in i'm not fully sure but in either scenario the head was not square so he didn't die um but you know some traps do have that but this trap does have that set up so that your head in there die immediately um but it has to be in the right spot so that's kind of like the downside to it now to talk about some of the cons of this particular trap it is a little bit more expensive than the typical basic rat trap that has the metal base i mean excuse me the wooden base with the metal bars on it um those traps in my area run for about a dollar to a dollar and fifty us dollars that is and this particular trap runs from about seven to eight bucks us dollars so fairly more expensive but this trap is reusable it's designed to be reusable in part it is made out of plastic instead of like the cheaper wood and metal ones that you would get um and to be honest with you i would i i would since i have caught this rat and i do have two of these style of traps i'm going to actually go ahead and set these back in the attic uh again and who knows something else may manage to get up there but i'd rather have the traps up there and they never catch anything than to have critters running around and there's nothing that can catch them um so i know i i think this is a great investment in my opinion if you have any questions or comments you know or negative points that you bought this trap and didn't like about it feel free in the comments feel free to share those in the comments below um i'm willing to discuss that with you and any other questions that you may have so that will then wrap things up for this video i ask you to please give this video a thumbs up and also leave a comment have any questions drop those below and don't forget to subscribe so until next time peace out","title":"Transcript (Unedited)"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.04.11-covid-vaccination/","text":"Since the COVID-19 vaccine was being rolled out, I eventually was able to sign up to get the Moderna vaccine. I did not want to be the very first to get it because of the medical disparities, like the Tuskegee Experiment, that exist when it comes to treating Black and minorities. At the same time, wanted to be able to have an additional line of defense in case I was exposed to COVID. First Shot Day Zero After the first shot, I did not have any side effects or reactions when the vaccine was administered. They suggest that you wait at the vaccination site least 15 minutes after being vaccinated to make sure that you do not have an allergic reaction to it. I did this and did not feel anything so I left and went back to work. I got the shot in my non-dominant arm. I did this in case the soreness became too great, that I would still able to do the essential tasks with my dominate arm. Some suggested that you take Tylenol before you get your vaccine. This is the wrong move to make as doing that will suppress your body's ability to elevate the temperature when it gets sick. Day One and Two The first and second day afterwards, my arm did feel sore. However, I only felt the soreness when I pressed on my shoulder or raised my arm above shoulder height. I did make sure to stay hydrated during this time. Day Three By day 3, all of the arm soreness had went away. No other symptoms were experienced. Second Shot Day Zero All felt well after getting the shot. I did get the second shot in the same shoulder, my non-dominant arm, that I got the first shot in. After getting the first shot, I stuck around (but was not required to) for 15 minutes before leaving. After doing this, went back to work. Day One Woke up and had full body ache as the only side effect. I had read where some said that they described their pain as if they had been hit with a Mack truck. However, my pain was not that severe. I would describe mine as the Kool-Aid Man running through a wall when he says \"Oh Yea\" type ache. As the day progressed on, I began to experience more side effects. Chills and fever eventually set in. I checked my temperature several times on this day and at the peak, my temperature hit 101.3 degree F. I also took two doses of store-brand Tylenol according to the package instructions (once per 6 hours) to manage the fever and aches. I will also add that I did make sure that I ate and stayed hydrated with orange juice and water throughout the day. As mentioned by others, it does have the same symptoms as the flu. Day Two Woke up and felt mostly fine. Still had some body aches that were on the pain level of walking into a glass door. The fever did go away and my temperature was in the 98 degree F range. Started having a burning or pain in my arm pit area of the shoulder that I got the injection in. Did not really think much of it at the time as some deodorants can cause skin irritation. Day Three The burning and pain in my arm pit area continued. I checked the area and noticed that the Lymph node that is located in the same shoulder as the injection site has swollen. Swollen enough that when my arm is down, that it applies pressure on it and causes some pain. By no means am I a medical professional, but I do understand that it is the lymphatic system responsibility to capture and isolate viruses and bacteria and redirect them out of the body. That being said, my body does seem to be responding properly to the vaccine. Thus why staying hydrated after getting vaccinated is important as the body cannot flush the bad stuff out of your system if you do not put new stuff (e.g. water) into your system. Day Four Soreness at the injection site has majority, like 95%, gone away. If I press really hard, then I can feel some soreness. Lymph node is still swollen, but it does seem to be going down. Day Five Lymph node can be found if deeply searched for and is kinda swollen, but it is still decreasing. All feels good like before the vaccine. Conclusion The pharmacist told me just before she gave me the first shot that from the people that she had given the vaccine to, those who had had COVID before getting the vaccine, had worse symptoms than those who never got COVID. Based on the posts from friends on social media, I can agree that this statement is true. The ones that had COVID and got the vaccine described it as having the worse pain ever. This was an interesting experience. I figured that I would share mine as others can have some sense of what they could experience if they choose to get vaccinated. There are a number of factors that come into play such as your current health condition and lifestyle, that determine whether you will have very few or a lot of side effects from the vaccine.","title":"COVID Vaccination"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.04.11-covid-vaccination/#first-shot","text":"","title":"First Shot"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.04.11-covid-vaccination/#day-zero","text":"After the first shot, I did not have any side effects or reactions when the vaccine was administered.

(Unedited)"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.03-garden-update/","text":"Here is the latest from the garden about what changes I have made for the upcoming growing season and the observations of what nature has done. Organization In previous years, there was a gap between each of the raised beds. This year, I decided to change the layout of one of the raised beds. It is now one long bed. The containers that were in place to separate the beds have been moved to the space between another set of beds. Ant Bed In part of this new, longer bed, is an ant bed. A bed within a bed. (lol) I was going to put grits on the ant bed in an attempt to get rid of them, but did not since there was forecasted rain and the grits would not have had time enough to do their job. Instead, I dug up about a 1/3 of the ant bed and threw it in a different part of the yard. The ants were big mad of course. Since then I have poked in and around the ant bed and have not seen any activity. I assume that the ants may have migrated or died as a result of their relocation. Will continue to monitor the ant bed as it is in the middle of the growing space. Side of House The greens that seeded themselves on the side of the house are doing well. In total, I counted about 14 collard green plants. Of those, about 4 of them have gone to seed. Oddly, these are some of the smaller of the greens. The bigger greens are still growing and have not gone to seed. May actually start harvesting the bigger greens. Strawberry Patch I planted a cucumber plant in the strawberry patch. The reason I did this because it already has a trellis in the patch from attempting to grow vertical items in it in previous years. Only concern that I have about this particular patch is that it may not receive enough sunlight for the cucumbers to do well. It receives a decent amount for the strawberries. Now that I have paid more attention, the one strawberry plant that I put in there back in 2019, has now grown and taken over the entire bed. Container Plants The oregano in the black container has gotten off to a great start. Even have given some of it away because it was growing super aggressively. The oregano that is in the green container is growing, but definitely has seen better days. I have removed the dead twigs that was on it from last years growth. Onion plant has been moved from a small container to the green self-watering container. When removing it, I did note that it did have substantial roots. I do not believe that it had become root bound. In another container, I planted basil and a bell pepper plant. You are probably asking why would I put two plants in the same container. Well the bell pepper will outgrow the basil. It is possible for the basil to have sufficient height in a way that it would interfere with the pepper's growth, but in my experience, bell peppers can get to a height of 3 to 3.5 feet (1.07 meters) at their peek. Add a trellis and they will grow even taller. Non-Container or Grow Beds Because the seeds from various mustard and collard greens have blown over the yard, those seeds are showing up in unexpected areas of the yard. One of those areas was where I had a deck that was torn out last year. I think from moving the dead limbs or the wind has contributed to the new plants sprouting up in unexpected locations. Small Block Bed I have planted tomatoes in this bed. The store did not have cherry tomatoes unfortunately. I usually get those because they grow fast enough that the squirrels will not eat them before they mature. Long Trellis Bed I planted a cucumber and a pepper plant in this bed. This bed had a number of weeds and some yellow tomatoes from the previous season. It is possible that tomato plant could sprout up from this, but highly unlikely. Not Planted I have several plants that I have purchased but have not put in the ground yet. These include marigolds, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, and tomatoes. They will be going in the ground this week as I want to maximize the garden this year. Weather There was one rainfall last week. The rest of the week, I used water from the rainwater collection to water the plants with. Each of the plantings got about 1/4 or 1/2 a bucket of water around its base. This morning, it did rain and there is slightly more rain in the forecast for later today and tomorrow (Star Wars Day). Will hold off on using the collected rain water. However, the collected rain water does need to be used to bring the water level down as it has been near or at max capacity since I have installed it.","title":"Garden Update, May 3, 2021"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.03-garden-update/#organization","text":"In previous years, there was a gap between each of the raised beds.

Add a trellis and they will grow even taller.","title":"Container Plants"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.03-garden-update/#non-container-or-grow-beds","text":"Because the seeds from various mustard and collard greens have blown over the yard, those seeds are showing up in unexpected areas of the yard.

I shared with him that I had been interested in joining the group, but had not found a chapter to be a part of. After several discussions and previewing some of their meetings, I decided to join. One of the first speeches that you have to give is call the Ice Breaker. In short, it is the speech that you give that formally introduces yourself to the group so that people can have some background information about you. Preparation Using Provided Resources Toastmasters has a system called Pathways. In the Pathways system, there are many of resources that are provided that prepare you for the various speeches that you need to do. For the ice breaker speech, a worksheet was available for how to structure your speech and spaces that you can write in whatever you choose. This particular speech was structured in a manner that was similar to how my 10th Grade English teacher suggested that essays be written. ToastMasters format was: Opening Body Main Point 1 Main Point 2 Main Point 3 Closing English teacher's essay format was: Introduction Thesis statement Bing Bang Bongo Conclusion Pratically the exact same format that I had learned who knows how long ago and leveraged in college for those essays that I despised. This is one of those moments where you learned something long ago, but did not realize you would really need it in the future, except in college. Fully Written Speech vs Outline When I first started doing YouTube videos , I would write out a script for the video. I quickly realized that wrtiing a script was time consuming and did not allow you to adjust things on the fly. You had to have your entire speech fully thought out before giving it. Toastmasters suggested writing a speech. After doing some research, I did find that some just create an outline for their speeches. Thus I took the outline approach for my first speech. When doing an outline, you are not writing every single word out. Instead, you are writing the main points that you want to make while doing your speech. It also allows you to adjust as need be by skipping over some of the points in case you run short on time. Other Details I titled my speech \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" after the novel. Reason being is that I had a coaching call with Ryan Cox earlier in the year. In our discussion, he mentioned that I had a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde way of things. That I am known for working with technology, but also known for being a handyman and do it yourselfer. Those are commonly two distinct categories, but I have an unique skillset that merges the both of them together. Following this title, I used those two different personalities and skillsets to be my first and second main points in my speech. From there, I connect the two main points by using my third main point as both of those roles require problem solving. The Review I was given a good review by my evaluator. The only negative item that was was pointed out, was that I was looking away from the camera during the speech when I did look up. Reasoning being is that my webcam is situated between my dual monitor set up. When looking up at the audience instead of keeping my head down on my paper, like it was instilled in me from high school speech class, since the audience was to my left, I looked to my left. YouTubers are a bit more forgiving when it comes to looking at the camera, so it did not phase me as much when I was doing it. Soon as it was mentioned though, I had a \"d'oh\" reaction to the comment. Conclusion I did better than I thought I would with my first speech. This first success means that I have greater success ahead of me in my future speeches and presentations.","title":"ToastMasters Ice Breaker"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.05-toastmasters-ice-breaker-speech/#background","text":"Sometime ago, one of my coworkers had mentioned that he was part of Toastmasters .

I know that I do. Often times when I go out and everyone around me is sitting, I will stand up because I am tired of sitting. This is one of the several way Walk or Exercise It is recommended that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, or approximately 30 minutes per day for 5 days per week. Those that workout more or physical trainers may state a higher number. I normally go for a walk during my lunch break at work, if I bring a lunch. I take about a 20-30 minute walk each time, which equates to about 1 to 1.5 miles. You may not think that is a lot, but do keep in mind that the area I am walking in does have hills. On days that the weather does not permit (e.g. raining) or is not ideal (e.g. too hot or cold) for walking outside, I have found that other coworkers walk on a particular floor in the building. This particular floor is set up in a way that allows you to do laps around it. I have done laps in the building a few times in an effort to get my step count up. I previously wrote an article that describes 7 ways that you can get more steps in your day . I would encourage you to read that article to get additional walking ideas. Water Intake When I am working on the computer, majority of the time I am consuming water. Occasionally I may drink something different like tea or juice, but the preferred choice is water. By drinking water while you work, if you drink enough of it, it will make you go to the bathroom. Thus you are able to get more steps in your day . For me, I have noticed that drinking more fluids, especially more water, will motivate my body to have a bowel movement, and thus reducing the dead weight that I am carrying around and losing weight over all. Staying full on water will result in you consuming less calories because your body doesn't feel hungry. Eat When Your Body Says To, Not When The Clock Does The American diet and system is structured in a way for individuals to eat 3 times per day - breakfast, lunch, and dinner - in addition to eating snacks. Now the recommended daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories. If you are more active than the typical American, then you can up that number to 2,500 calories. What if you are not as active, like most of us during the quarantine or those of us that work desk jobs? It would make sense that you decrease that number correct? It would. However, when you read the nutrition labels, they do not mention about you eating less than the daily recommended amount. Think about it, if you are only burning about 1,000 calories per day, but are consuming 2,000 calories per day, then you are in reality, overeating. The body, while a miraculous machine, does not immediately adapt to some situations. Energy usage and storage is one of them. Where do those extra 1,000 calories that you did not burn go? They get stored as fat. What I decided to do is to let my body tell me when to eat instead of eating when the clock says to eat. I will say that sometimes I do let the first meal of the day be governed by the clock. During the work week, that first meal is around lunch time. During the weekends, it can vary between the typical breakfast time, lunch time, and what I have on my agenda for the day. What are the indicators that the body is saying that you need to eat? Here are some of mine: headache (a.k.a. hunger headache) growling stomach feeling weak, but not faint In doing things this way, I know that I am not overeating. I am also making my body adjust to burning what it already has in fat stores instead of only burning what I eat. Intermittent Fasting Fasting? You are starving yourself. No, I am not starving myself. There are several intermittent fasting strategies. The most common is the 16:8, which you do all of your eating within an 8 hour time period. The remaining time of the day you do not consume anything OR you consume only water, tea, or black coffee. Now before considering any fasting method, make sure you are in good health. If you are not in good health or if you have you any chronic diseases or conditions, then consult with your doctor before you attempt intermittent fasting. It is believed that the benefits from fasting are Forces your body to burn the fat stores that you have, thus resulting in weight loss. Allows your body to take a break from always digesting food. Allows your insulin levels to go down, thus preventing or reducing your chance of developing diabetes (which is insulin resistance). My Fasting Method I do the 12:12 method. Where I eat within a 12 hour window and fast for 12 hours. Now in doing this, sometimes that 12:12 ends up being a 16:8 or 18:6 because of when I start eating. If I start my day off by drinking sufficient amounts of water, then I am able to go for a longer amount of time between waking up and eating my first item (not necessarily a meal) of the day. It took about a week or two for my body to get in the fasting habit. Once it did, did not have to worry about eating so much. Also part of my fasting strategy is to not eat anything after 8 PM (20:00). Reason being is that your food needs time to digest. When you eat and then go to bed, you have a greater chance of experiencing heartburn or acid reflux because your body is processing food in a position (horizontally) that it is not normally used to doing. As a result, that stomach acid is able to go up the esophagus easier. The Sweet Tooth You have experienced it before... you have a meal and then you say \"Now I need something sweet\". Instead of going for the snack cakes, ice cream, or other sugar loaded food, try eating some fruit. Not the fruit cups that are loaded with syrup, but actual fruit like an apple or orange. The reason that I suggest to eat the actual fruit instead of snack cakes is because the fruit has other vitamins, minerals, and in some cases fiber that your body really needs. Snack cakes are usually made of flour (whether bleached or enriched) and are mostly empty calories because they satisfy your taste buds, but do not provide great nutritional value. Limiting Meat At one point in time, I limited the amount of meat that I would eat. Sometimes I would not eat meat at all. Other times, I would limit myself to eating meat only once per day. What thing that I have noticed with myself is that if I eat a lot of meat, then my stomach or abdomen becomes larger. What I have concluded from this, is that it takes longer for the body to process meat than it does vegetables or fruit. Meatless Monday There is a trend of not eating meat once per week. you can do a search for the #MeatlessMonday hashtag and seeing the number of posts. The reason being why this is a thing, is because more Americans are realizing that consuming a lot of meat can be bad for your health. I say \"can be\" because everybody has their own health needs and conditions and I do not believe there is a one size fits all diet that exist. I do believe that the diet you eat is determined by a number of factors including environment, activity level, and your genetics. Conclusion Doing a combination of these strategies and methods have allowed me to maintain my current weight. I have been able to lose some weight by increasing my water intake. Consider giving these strategies if you are wanting to lose weight.","title":"How Programmers Can Stay In Shape"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.07-how-can-programmers-stay-in-shape/#walk-or-exercise","text":"It is recommended that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, or approximately 30 minutes per day for 5 days per week.

There's a explanation for this. Sometime ago, the fiancee and I discussed doing a YouTube video challenge. The objective was that we post a video on our respective channels each day for a month. Given that we had some time on both of our schedules, I brought the idea back up again. Through the discussion, the idea went from a month of videos to a month of blog posts. Then it went from a month of blog posts to a week of blog posts. The Rules The rules for the challenge were simple. The rules for the challenge were to post every day of the challenge. That's it. We were not interested in making it too complex as setting the bar too high, could mean that the challenge would not get done at all. Perhaps in the future, the rules may be a bit more rigid like a minimum number of works or writing posts related to a particular theme. The Posts Some of the content that I wrote, was for project documentation. Since I keep my software project documentation on my blog, I counted it as a blog post. Fiancee disagreed, but whatever. If you did not see the posts that I made this week, here is a summary of them below. Sunday: Updated Light Show documentation , the About , and the Projects pages Monday: Garden Update: May 3, 2021 Tuesday: Ecobee Status Monitor Documentation Wednesday: ToastMasters Ice Breaker Speech Thursday: Get A Tech Job with No Experience Friday: How Can Programmers Stay In Shape Saturday: This is Saturday's post Lessons Learned While it has been a productive week, there were some lessons that I learned from doing this challenge. Content creation requires some skill - To be able to come up with new ideas and topics all the time, requires a lot of creativity. Spell check - Since I write my blog posts in a text editor (I am a programmer after all) and not in a word processor, sometimes I have misspelled words in my posts and have to go back and correct them. Those misspellings are from the result of fat-fingering when typing, not so much not knowing how to spell. Going to have to look into using an online grammar check service or adding a step to the CI/CD process of my blog that will check spelling of the content. For the time being, I am copying an pasting into MS Word or LibreOffice Writer and after doing the check, then pasting back into my IDE. Grammar check - Like with spell check, grammar check on my posts would also be great if there was an online service that offered it or that I could integrate it with my CI/CD process of publishing new blog posts. Like with spell check, I copy and paste the post into a word processor and then back to the IDE once the check has been completed. Post Scheduling - I do not currently have the ability to schedule posts since I use a static website for my blog . Instead, I write the posts ahead of time in a different branch. Then when I am ready to publish the post, I create and merge a pull request on my blog's repository and the CI/CD process takes care of generating the files and pushing them to the website. Since the CI/CD is doing the bulk of the work, I can initiate and complete the pull request from any device that allows me to access GitHub . Conclusion You will see more posts from me going forward. Technology and Handyman posts will be regular as they will be synchronized with my YouTube videos. You will start seeing more posts in the Gardening category, because I intend on using the blog as journal to track work in the garden going forward. Hope you enjoy the readings and there will probably be another challenge in the future that will hopefully go for a month.","title":"Blog Challenge, May 2021"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.08-blog-challenge-may-2021/#background","text":"Those of you that are regular readers of the blog, may have noticed that more content was published this week than in weeks or even years past.

I signed up early in 2020, and then boom... COVID hit. Thus I lost an entire year of Pre-Check because it was not safe to travel with a lot of other people. Since I was not traveling by myself, I chose not to use the dedicated Pre-Check line that is available at the airport. My experience for getting through security varied as I traveled through multiple airports to and from my destination. In each of the airports, I went through the general security checkpoint and not the Pre-Check Checkpoint. Some of the things that were common at all of the airports when going through the security checkpoint: had to pull down your face mask so they could see your full face when comparing your ID had to have a mask on to be allowed through the checkpoint What Is TSA Pre-Check? TSA Pre-Check is a program that you can request to be pre-screened for flights. When you go through security, you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. You are also allowed to leave your laptop or other electronics in your carry-on baggage. Ideally, this program is designed for people that fly frequently as it allows you to get through the security checkpoint faster. In order to sign up for the program, you have to apply online or at an airport, get fingerprinted, photo taken, and pay the $100 fee. If you approved for Pre-Check, you are then given a Known Traveler Number (KTN). The KTN should be kept secret, like your social security number, so that others cannot use it. Also, the KTN at to be provided to the airline that you are flying on. When you have a KTN associated with your boarding pass, you will see the \"Pre-Check\" logo included on your boarding pass. Then when you go to the airport, you can go through the Pre-Check Checkpoint instead of the General Security Checkpoint. Why Not Clear? The reason that I did not sign up for Clear is because every airport does not have Clear available. However, majority (if not all) have Pre-Check as Pre-Check is a program overseen by the TSA (Transportation Security Administration). Clear is a service provided by a private company, thus its implementation at an airport has to be approved by the TSA and that airport's governing body. Pre-Check at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) I believe due to COVID and probably other reasons, ATL was doing a modified version of security screening. This version, they gave everyone the Pre-Check protocol for going through security. This means able to keep shoes and jackets on. Also not having to unload larger electronics out of your bag. They had people go through the metal detector as well as the body scanner. From what I could tell, there was not a method to how they determined what device you went though. A Specific Type of Mask One thing that really stood out to me was that they were picky about the type of mask that was worn through the checkpoint. I normally wear neck gaiters as a mask because they do not pull on your ears. At this checkpoint, the agent said that I had to wear one that goes around the ears because that's what was preferred and that I could switch back to my neck gaiter once I got through the security checkpoint. She then proceeded to give me a cloth mask that they had for people who did not have masks. Thus... the government gave me a mask. Pre-Check at Denver International Airport (DEN) and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) After scanning my boarding pass and the agent verifying my ID, I was given a red laminated card ( SEA ) or piece of paper ( DEN ) that identified me as being Pre-Check approved. Thus I was able to go through the general security checkpoint and get the benefits of Pre-Check like not having to take my shoes off, being able to keep my jacket on, and going through the metal detector instead of the body scanner. Only thing that it did not get me was access to a shorter security line. Pre-Check at Chicago-Midway International Airport (MDW) There was no modified measures here. The TSA agent at the gate asked if I knew that I had Pre-Check on my boarding pass. I told her that I did and that some of the other airports would give you a card that noted it if you were flying with others. She said that they did not do that at MDW and that I would be subjected to the same screening as everyone else since I was going through the general security checkpoint. That was not music to my ears, but the band played on. It just so happened that they let some older people who primarily used a wheelchair to get around go before myself and others through the body scanner, which resulted line backing up almost immediately. Once the agents realized that the line was not moving because of the elderly, they let a number of people, myself included, go through the metal detector instead of the body scanner. Essentially I got some of the benefits of Pre-Check, but on a technicality. Conclusion It was very interesting to see how different airports do the same checks differently whether you have Pre-Check or not. Especially since the airports have to follow the same federal rules for screening passengers. If I am traveling by myself next time, I will try to go through the Pre-Check line so that I can receive the full benefit of having Pre-Check.","title":"TSA Pre-Check Differences in Non-Precheck Line by Airport"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.24-tsa-precheck-differences/#background","text":"I took my first flights after being approved for TSA Pre-Check .

Not to mention, the chair had seen better days. It was manufactured in 1965 (really it has the date stamped on the bottom), so it was time for an upgrade. Solution I purchased a replacement chair. I had considered gaming chairs, but those were not as comfortable. Thus this executive office chair. I talk about it in more detail in the video below. Video Transcript (Unedited) what's going on good people this saturday project is putting together a office chair i uh you know due to the coronavirus and working from home the previous office chair that i had got worn out and given the age of the chair uh i figured all right it's time to go ahead and get a new one what should i get so i'm gonna share with you what i got as well as the assembly of said chair Music all right so this is the office chair that i ended up purchasing i got it off that uh amazon i'll just be honest uh this chair is the is an office exec executive office chair now i know a lot of people like why didn't you get a gaming chair well i looked into the gaming chairs and the thing about the gaming chairs that i saw is they did not have enough padding they are while they are cheap and functional and they look cool they do not necessarily support you for sitting for extended periods of time and looking at the reviews and some of the commentary that other people that have said that um yeah i'm glad i didn't buy those gaming chairs i actually had a cousin that bought one of those gaming chairs and so when we did a zoom meeting for thanksgiving with our family members um you know i saw him in one of the chairs that he got off of the gaming chairs that he got off amazon and so i asked him about it i was like hey how you feel about that chair that you sitting in and yeah pretty much his consensus was he hates it and so uh he mentioned a lot of what i saw which is is not as comfortable and that it um you know he kind of wished that he got something a little bit better so um and as you see i am sitting in the chair that i am talking about so uh i'm not making this up i actually do use what i'm talking about so this particular chair uh it is very comfortable it does have a weight capacity of 400 pounds now obviously you can tell and you've seen me in other videos that i'm nowhere near close to 400 pounds but i wanted a chair that was uh sturdy enough um you know and not just like borderline uh at the limits because you know things happen right you know i could sit in the chair and then pick up i don't know a heavy book or something and bam the chair breaks that's not that's not a situation that i want to be in um so uh i chose to share like i say weight capacity uh the legs on this chair are metal not plastic like you would get with a lot of those gaming chairs that you see on amazon they usually have plastic wheels with a plastic legs and the failure point on those chairs are usually the legs because that's where your weight capacity comes in at um and also the weight capacity on those chairs from what i was able to see was right around 200 to maybe 225 now i'm like 185 so 200 is not that far of a stretch for me like if i eat a big meal i could probably get close to 200. so um i was kind of wanting something with a little bit more weight capacity and so this chair came up as one of those options um also as i mentioned the padding on this chair this padding on this chair is rather thick it's very comfortable like i sit here and a lot of times you know i'm working from home because of the virus but then also after i get done working from home then i continue to sit here and work on videos like this or i work on coding projects that i have so something else and you know 10 12 even in some cases 14 hours in this chair and i don't feel sore or anything of that nature one other thing i wanted to point out is for me so i'm six feet tall and so the back of the chair is while it's right at the bottom of my head i wanted something that did have support for my upper back um because the chair that i have at my office like work office uh it does have full body support up here and it actually has even a headrest and so uh this one doesn't have a headrest unfortunately and i kind of wish it did but i'm okay with it at least supporting my shoulders and upper back because that's where a lot of your attention um that in your lower back is where your tension comes in when you're sitting for extended periods of time so i'm going to get into this assembly so this is obviously the box that it came in 50 pounds a pretty big box um i want to say maybe two feet by three feet uh as you see it says 50 pounds well excuse me 56 pounds is the gross weight the chair itself is 50 pounds so a very sturdy chair um so here are the instructions um everything that comes in here not many parts as you may think it may have uh like i said it was a lot of it was already pre-assembled so the mechanical portions of like the seat that raises and lowers the chair itself is already assembled in one piece you just have to attach it to the base of the chair it has these set of bolts um and then it comes with a tool to put everything together so literally i did not have to go get any tools um the tool came with it all right so i have in this photo taking the base out of the box as i mentioned the base is made out of metal and all you gotta do to put the wheels in there are holes in the base and you just slide them in and they lock in on their own and then here is the pack of bolts and the tool as well as the plastic caps that come with it uh just follow the instructions on how to assemble it so this is the mechanical portion of the chair so this is what controls the up and down movement as well as the rock back functionality usually i don't lock the chair uh from rocking back unlike some chairs this chair does not have the functionality where you can lock it in like various degrees you either lock it straight up or you don't lock it at all so that's kind of a sucky part like if you like to slightly recline back and lock your chair this chair won't do that like i can i'm leaning back now as you see but it's still going to move but once i sit up i don't know if you can hear that on camera but that's that click that you just probably heard was the chair actually locking in the upright position so now it won't go back and then i can unlock it and i will go back and then the other handle over here is for the height adjustment i keep this chair at the highest level that is sitting like i mentioned i'm six feet tall so my legs are literally angled straight across in this position i wanted a chair that was a little bit higher um but you know given the value and so forth this was the kind of the best of the deal in terms of chair height and comfort level all right and here's another angle it clearly marks where the front is and so you see front here as well as the front on the mounting portion so you make sure those are both pointing in the same direction i did put the arms on um it's a step in here that mentions about putting the arms on you do have to screw them on on the side there i had some difficulties getting the Music back of the chair connected to the arms because the back of the chair actually connects to the arms it does not connect to the seat of this chair so that's how that stays up but i was able to i had to loosen some of the other screws in on the chair to be able to get the back to properly align with one of the screws that had some difficulties with and then once i did that then everything was able to be tightened up as far as the back of the chair and the armrests are concerned so i am happy with it i um i believe i paid about 250 for this chair um i give or take maybe 25 on that and so uh this sheriff so far i've been using it um for about three months now and it's held up pretty well um one other thing i want to know is so a lot of those gaming chairs that i was looking at uh they have like faux leather or like polyester or some other non-breathing type material that they are made of this has a it's not full leather is i think it may be like a something similar to leather so it's a little bit durable but not exactly the gaming chair quality that you would think um you know it's not the gaming chair fabric that you would want on this type of chair and so um but it does work i know somebody else that i had a customer that had a similar chair to this this one uh the one that they had though it was it was the same brand but it was not as executive level if you will of a chair it has the same functionality it had the same assembly instructions too but their chair actually had a uh the back of the chair vibrated and you basically plugged in your laptop to the chair and the chair got the power to run the massager from the laptop very interesting concept um but you know i think it was a pretty cool chair i'm not sure how much they paid for it but i know that that's how that chair was designed so um yeah there's that if you have any questions about this feel free to drop a comment down below i'll be glad to answer anything to the best of my ability regarding the assembly of the chair or the review of this chair and how it has played out thus far um or in the future if you have any excuse me if you

maybe two feet by three feet uh as you see it says 50 pounds well excuse me 56 pounds is the gross weight the chair itself is 50 pounds so a very sturdy chair um so here are the instructions um everything that comes in here not many parts as you may think it may have uh like i said it was a lot of it was already pre-assembled so the mechanical portions of like the seat that raises and lowers the chair itself is already assembled in one piece you just have to attach it to the base of the chair it has these set of bolts um and then it comes with a tool to put everything together so literally i did not have to go get any tools um the tool came with it all right so i have in this photo taking the base out of the box as i mentioned the base is made out of metal and all you gotta do to put the wheels in there are holes in the base and you just slide them in and they lock in on their own and then here is the pack of bolts and the tool as well as the plastic caps that come with it uh just follow the instructions on how to assemble it so this is the mechanical portion of the chair so this is what controls the up and down movement as well as the rock back functionality usually i don't lock the chair uh from rocking back unlike some chairs this chair does not have the functionality where you can lock it in like various degrees you either lock it straight up or you don't lock it at all so that's kind of a sucky part like if you like to slightly recline back and lock your chair this chair won't do that like i can i'm leaning back now as you see but it's still going to move but once i sit up i don't know if you can hear that on camera but that's that click that you just probably heard was the chair actually locking in the upright position so now it won't go back and then i can unlock it and i will go back and then the other handle over here is for the height adjustment i keep this chair at the highest level that is sitting like i mentioned i'm six feet tall so my legs are literally angled straight across in this position i wanted a chair that was a little bit higher um but you know given the value and so forth this was the kind of the best of the deal in terms of chair height and comfort level all right and here's another angle it clearly marks where the front is and so you see front here as well as the front on the mounting portion so you make sure those are both pointing in the same direction i did put the arms on um it's a step in here that mentions about putting the arms on you do have to screw them on on the side there i had some difficulties getting the Music back of the chair connected to the arms because the back of the chair actually connects to the arms it does not connect to the seat of this chair so that's how that stays up but i was able to i had to loosen some of the other screws in on the chair to be able to get the back to properly align with one of the screws that had some difficulties with and then once i did that then everything was able to be tightened up as far as the back of the chair and the armrests are concerned so i am happy with it i um i believe i paid about 250 for this chair um i give or take maybe 25 on that and so uh this sheriff so far i've been using it um for about three months now and it's held up pretty well um one other thing i want to know is so a lot of those gaming chairs that i was looking at uh they have like faux leather or like polyester or some other non-breathing type material that they are made of this has a it's not full leather is i think it may be like a something similar to leather so it's a little bit durable but not exactly the gaming chair quality that you would think um you know it's not the gaming chair fabric that you would want on this type of chair and so um but it does work i know somebody else that i had a customer that had a similar chair to this this one uh the one that they had though it was it was the same brand but it was not as executive level if you will of a chair it has the same functionality it had the same assembly instructions too but their chair actually had a uh the back of the chair vibrated and you basically plugged in your laptop to the chair and the chair got the power to run the massager from the laptop very interesting concept um but you know i think it was a pretty cool chair i'm not sure how much they paid for it but i know that that's how that chair was designed so um yeah there's that if you have any questions about this feel free to drop a comment down below i'll be glad to answer anything to the best of my ability regarding the assembly of the chair or the review of this chair and how it has played out thus far um or in the future if you have any excuse me if you enjoyed this content please give this video a

Why? Because I do not want to sit around in an airport looking at other people and waiting for the plane to show up. Besides, when you do not have a layover, you get your destination quicker and are less likely to buy overpriced food and drinks at the airport. In May 2021, I traveled to Seattle. With COVID-19 practically dominating 2020 and nobody going anywhere, it was time to get out and explore, safely of course. Given that I was flying across to the other side of the country, there was only 1 non-stop flight that was available and it was at the worse time to fly... 6AM going to the destination and like 11PM coming from the destination. Thus the only choice was to get a flight with a layover in it. In the past, if I had to do a layover, then I would try to find the shortest one possible. I had a work flight in 2013 that had a 30 minute layover, which was great! However, the only problem was that the arriving plane parked at Terminal A and the departing plane was at Terminal E. Oh... and this was at the Charlotte Airport (CLT) for those who have been there. Never would do a layover that close again unless I knew that the gates were close to each other. This time, I picked a layover that seemed reasonable from the options presented. Below I account what I was able to do during the layover just to give you an idea of what you can do to maximize your trip in the future. Preparation Research What You Can Do Before You Land Do not wait until you get off your flight in order to look up things to do. Do this ahead of time. Reason being is that you will waste your layover time trying to find something to do when you could be using that time to reserve transportation to get you to the attractions or restaurants that you want to check out. Not to mention, if you are using a car sharing service (e.g. Uber or Lyft), it may take a moment to find the pickup points for these services as the airports have control on where these drivers can pick you up at. Hint: Usually they can be found easier if you follow the signs that say \"Ground Transportation\". Have Enough Time Before you leave the airport, make sure that you have enough time to do whatever it is you choose to do and to be able to get back. I would suggest that you have a minimum layover time of 3 hours between flights. Any shorter and you really will not be able to do anything fun or adventurous and get back through the security checkpoint before your flight departs. Pre-screened Security Check Now if you have TSA Pre-Check or Clear , then you can consider taking more time to do activities (although I would not recommend it) as the security lines for either of these are usually shorter than the general security line. I talk about my experiences and benefits of having TSA Pre-Check in another post . Do remember that because you are leaving the airport, that you will have to go back through airport security to board your connecting flight. Thus do not buy souvenirs or other items that will get you arrested during your layover. Leave The Airport Denver International Airport (DEN) Layover - 3 Hours The Atlanta (ATL) to Seattle (SEA) flight had a 3 hour layover in Denver. Wanted to try to do more during this layover, but did not. Downtown Denver, where most of the popular attractions are, was at least 25 minutes away on this clear sunny day. From the airport, you can see the Rocky Mountains and the tallest of Downtown buildings from the airport. Because the attractions were so far away, used the time to go to Renegado Tacos and Margaritas on Tower Rd. Talking with the Uber Driver, he had never heard of the place. Once we arrived, we saw that the restaurant appeared to be fairly new as the neighboring building still had some work that needed to be completed on it and construction vehicles could be seen in the distance working on nearby plot of land. Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the food that I had, but it was good. I will say that they seemed limited in the sauces that they had that you would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant. After leaving the restaurant, went back to the airport as there was only about 1 hour left before the connecting flight was to leave for Seattle (SEA). Getting though security was quick, I assume because of the time of day and that it was on a Wednesday, which is the middle of the work week. Chicago-Midway International Airport (MDW) Layover - 4 Hours On the return flight from Seattle (SEA) to Atlanta (ATL), had a 4 hour layover in Chicago. First stop was to get some food. Near the airport was a place called Masters Pancake House . Like with the last layover, checked with the Uber driver to see if he was familiar with the restaurant, and he was not. While the name does not indicate it, the restaurant was ran by Hispanics. Thus the food was a variety of American Breakfast with a Hispanic twist. In my opinion, the food was large size portions for the price. Like the omelet that I had must have been made from at least 4-5 eggs. Because there was still plenty of time, decided to use it. The next stop was to check out The Bean, also known as the Cloud Gate. While going to and leaving the Cloud Gate, I got to see some of the major attractions in Chicago like the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), Soldier Field, and Lake Michigan as we rode down S Lake Shore Drive. Since the Crown Fountain was right next to the Cloud Gate, visited it as well. Still had some time left, but given the distance that I was from the airport and to factor in the traffic, figured that it was time to head back. That proved to be a wise decision. After arriving at the airport, it took approximately 45 minutes (if not longer) to get through security. I am not sure why they were so slow with getting people though the checkpoint. By the time we reached the gate, they were starting to board the plane and have people line up. Midway (MDW) has to do better about getting people efficiently though the checkpoint. Conclusion Taking a trip to one destination, can be more valuable if you are able to get in additional cities and sights in during the layover. In the future, I will probably be hesitant about trying to get a nonstop flight to my destination, if the layover goes through a city that I have not visited for and does not cost significantly different.","title":"Maximize Your Layover, Leave The Airport"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.11-maximize-your-layover/#background","text":"Normally when I fly, I try to find a nonstop flight.

Ways to Diversify Real Estate look into land banks for vacant properties that could be purchased for lower rates buy and hold or buy and flip, increase value Stock Market ownership in a company dividends provide you with income that is similar to a paycheck. reinvesting dividends allow you to continue to increase the value of your portfolio blue chip stocks - bigger companys; it is suggested to hold these for the long term as they are continously growing and mostlikely will not go out of business anytime soon; some use blue chip stocks as their savings account as the ROR from the stock is greater than the APY on a savings account ETF - a group of stocks; S&P 500 is an example; QQQ ticker REIT - real estate investment trust - way to have ownership in real estate without actually having to be responsible for it invest based on your comfort for risk; if you don't know enough, then read more; otherwise you'll invest in something that you aren't knowledgable about and could lose money Cryptocurrency it is not regulated and thus you could lose out big time; no government oversight it could potentionally offset inflation because it doesn't have a control or controller it can be very volitale Bonds Usually not used by the younger generation Sometimes are used to back a 401K usually issued by governments; it is a safe bet for having a return; lower risk very stable High Yield Savings Account relatively safe way to invest usually wont earn more than 1.5% in interest Entrepreneurship selling product, service, leftover income from primary source of income to be used as capital for this income stream \"Brown Money\" Book that was mentioned juniebeans","title":"Creating Multiple Income Stream Notes"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#ways-to-diversify","text":"","title":"Ways to Diversify"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#real-estate","text":"look into land banks for vacant properties that could be purchased for lower rates buy and hold or buy and flip, increase value","title":"Real Estate"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#stock-market","text":"ownership in a company dividends provide you with income that is similar to a paycheck. reinvesting dividends allow you to continue to increase the value of your portfolio blue chip stocks - bigger companys; it is suggested to hold these for the long term as they are continously growing and mostlikely will not go out of business anytime soon; some use blue chip stocks as their savings account as the ROR from the stock is greater than the APY on a savings account ETF - a group of stocks; S&P 500 is an example; QQQ ticker REIT - real estate investment trust - way to have ownership in real estate without actually having to be responsible for it invest based on your comfort for risk; if you don't know enough, then read more; otherwise you'll invest in something that you aren't knowledgable about and could lose money","title":"Stock Market"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#cryptocurrency","text":"it is not regulated and thus you could lose out big time; no government oversight it could potentionally offset inflation because it doesn't have a control or controller it can be very volitale","title":"Cryptocurrency"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#bonds","text":"Usually not used by the younger generation Sometimes are used to back a 401K usually issued by governments; it is a safe bet for having a return; lower risk very stable","title":"Bonds"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#high-yield-savings-account","text":"relatively safe way to invest usually wont earn more than 1.5% in interest","title":"High Yield Savings Account"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#entrepreneurship","text":"selling product, service, leftover income from primary source of income to be used as capital for this income stream","title":"Entrepreneurship"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-creating-multiple-income-streams/#brown-money","text":"Book that was mentioned juniebeans","title":"\"Brown Money\""},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.12-pro-tower-machine-assembly-handyman/","text":"The customer requested my services to put together this work out equipment.

Video Transcript (Unedited) what's going on good people today's video i'm going to be talking about the assembly for a pro pt 600 power tower it is a workout machine um that i had to assemble for a customer here we go Music all right this particular machine i like i said i had to go and assemble it for a customer i don't have the specifics of like how long they how much it cost or anything of that nature but i did once i started opening the packaging and following the assembly instructions it did show a reference to dick's sporting goods so if you are interested in that you probably can get that from dick's sporting goods and so this is the box i did not take as many pictures as i normally do when i do these type of videos um that's just something a mistake on my end uh but this is the finalized machine you know once it is assembled and so it has multiple workout uh that multiple workouts that you can do on here and so this uh i guess cushion here actually it goes here on the back but it can also go down here on the bottom as you see there's this support here and support here so you can take it off and then put it down there and then use it as a knee pad of sorts to do other workouts on the machine and so uh the machine for this uh for as large as it is the assembly was relatively easy to do i was able to complete everything in about an hour uh majority of the bolts are the same so it has a pretty much every bolt that you see here with the exception of probably about six maybe eight of them are exactly the same so it's very difficult to make a mistake when trying to assemble this because of the fact there's so there's a lot of the same parts that go on the majority of the machine and for these bolts that are here is pretty much a bolt you put a washer on one end you slide it through wherever it's supposed to go then you put a washer on the other end and then you put a nut on the end of that bolt and all the nuts on here are locking nuts so that they do not back out easy as you are doing the workouts or whatever the case um i did do a couple of reps on it and it was able to hold me you know fine the maximum capacity according to the assembly instructions is 300 pounds for this particular machine the bars here the pull-up bars where you can do your i believe you do your dips these actually do come out this orange ball here and there's one on the other side you pull these out and then these drop down so that you have more space to do your pull-ups which is up here as i mentioned you can move this from this position down to the bottom here and then you also have like things where you can do like leg curls and so forth so it's useful um i actually have considered getting one of these myself just to be able to do some body weight workouts but it was fairly easy to assemble like i say in and out in about an hour i did have to use my hammer drill i probably could have gotten away with using like a socket wrench or um just a regular wrench to tighten up the nuts and bolts but given that those lock those lock washers on on there pretty strongly and so pretty much every time i went to go and tighten the bolts on here the hammer function like immediately almost kicked in uh just to put the nut on the bolt so uh i think it's pretty sturdy on here i did take care to make sure that those were not too tight that actually that the hammer drill didn't tighten so tight that actually started bending the metal but the metal uh i think i may have over drilled it just a little bit on some of them but the metal did not flex after maybe a little bit over tightening those um the only other i guess concern about this is so when you're putting this together the instructions do have like written steps because i'm so used to putting the you know furniture and other assemblies together without actually reading the written steps i was able to do it strictly just off the photos the diagrams on there are pretty clear on how you're supposed to assemble it and what bolt goes where the only thing i will say is i will add to that that the instructions also mentioned that you are supposed to assemble everything hand tighten only in the beginning and that's what i did so i got all the bolts in and hand tighten them so that they didn't you know the whole thing didn't fall back apart as i was still assembling assembling it and then once i got the whole assembly together then i started on the side over here starting and making my way from one bolt all the way around and then came back on the other side and did the same thing and everything worked out fine the rubber feet that you see here was already attached to the uh metal supports here so i didn't even have to do that part it was literally just put in all the bolts so screw i had i did have to secure these uh armrest pads on the uh horizontal supports here and this back pad to this cross plate here um but other than that everything else was straightforward didn't have to paint or anything of that nature so this is just a walkthrough of how you know easy was to assemble this fairly straightforward if you have any questions about this particular product

and some of the challenges and learning experiences. Time flies when you are having fun. Thus it has been 3 (three) months since Buddy showed up following me to the mailbox that day. Dog Park = Dog Conversation Where I am, there is a park dedicated for dogs to be able to run freely and socialize with other dogs. Buddy enjoys going to the park mostly because he enjoys being outside (weather permitting) and not so much for the socialization of other dogs. For the human aspect of being at the dog park, it's similar to how parents talk about their kids when at the playground. My dog has this habit. My dog as this condition. My dog is this years old. You get the idea. One person that was at the park, mentioned that one of her dogs had to have surgery and the surgery was around $5,000 (USD) to perform. I thought to myself that the $150 vet check up every 6 months doesn't sound so bad compared to that. Other dog conversations include where you buy certain things from. For exmaple, Buddy has a harness that goes around his chest. On the back of the harness, there's a handle that can be used to keep the dog next to you if he is trying to run away. While at the park, another dog owner mentioned about getting a harness for his dog. Thus I shared with him where I got it from and the reaction the dog has when the harness is being put on. Shoes = Going Outside Buddy knows that if I have on shoes, there's a great chance that I'm about to go outside. Buddy is always up for going outside until he gets tired of being outside and wants to come back in. After all he is an indoor dog. Sometimes I do go outside but tell him to stay inside because of the weather or other reasons. He's not a fan of this when it happens, so he will stand up on or scratch at the screen door, which I have to yell back for him to stop doing that and I will be back inside shortly. At this point he will just stand there looking out waiting for me to return. You Eat, I Eat (Sometimes) Any time that I eat food, Buddy always wants some, even if it would be bad for him (e.g. chocolate). Sometimes I will give him human food, but only if he has eaten his dog food first. Do not want to spoil his appetite and don't want him being used to getting human food everytime that I eat. Sometimes I have to tell him no, which he objects and looks a me sideways because of it, but he knows who is boss. Dogs Throw Temper Tantrums Kids throw temper tantrums and dogs do too. When nobody is at home, the dog goes in the kennel. He doesn't like to be in the kennel and will often times run to another room or sit down when told to go into the kennel. Ultimately, he is forced to go into the kennel, by either being picked up and placed in the kennel or by being pulled by the collar into the kennel. Sometimes, the dog, like a kid, will not eat his dog food. However, he'll ask (by licking his lips) for human food to eat. This is the equivalent of asking for dessert before eating dinner. No way am I going to allow that to happen. If he doesn't get the human food that he wants, he will stare and look at you with a head turned sideways as if he was saying you know I want some of what you have so share it. When this happens, I advise him to eat his own food first and then he will get human food. Sometimes he will then eat his own food, others will not. Conclusion I mentioned some of the dog issues to another individual. He told me that he and his wife got a dog before having kids and he admits that he helped him better prepare for kids. Reason being is that with the dog, he got to see how he and his wife would mesh when it came to caring for kids. Once the kids came along, things worked smoothly because they had seen who was the friendly parent and who was the restrictive parent. I'll be honest, I'm seeing the same in regards to my fiancee and myself. If you see your dog as a toddler aged kid and not just an animal, you will realize that your interactions will be better with your pet.","title":"Three Months With A Dog"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.22-three-months-with-a-dog/#dog-park-dog-conversation","text":"Where I am, there is a park dedicated for dogs to be able to run freely and socialize with other dogs.

The activity is designed to give speakers opportunities to improve their improptu speaking skills. Given that this meeting was taking place in the middle of the summer, I decided to make the topics all summer related. I did not use all of these questions as we did not have enough time to go through all of them. When it comes to preparing for Toastmasters meetings, it is better to have more questions that what you will actually need. The Topics You are the grill master for the upcoming cookout with 100 people. What's on the menu and how do you prepare the food? You get to the hotel for your vacation and the air conditioner is turned off. You immediately turn it on and set the temperature. What temperature did you set it to and why? You're invited to the cookout and are asked to bring the potato salad. You have never made potato salad before so you decide to buy it from the store. How do you disguise it so that it does not look store bought? Your neighbor is an early riser and every week cuts grass at 5:30 AM, waking you out of your last precious moments of sleep. You have decided to talk to him about his early habit. What do you say to him? It is a hot sunny day. You park your car with the windows open and go shopping. While shopping, a pop up shower hits and rain gets in your car. How do you get rid of the water? What's your favorite summer vacation spot? What activities are available to do at the spot? Summer time and COVID restrictions being lifted means that people are vacationing more, especially to the beaches. Describe the bad driving habits that you have seen by these beach goers. What trip or vacation did you have planned last year, that was cancelled by COVID, that you would still like to take? Describe summer in three words. Trees provide great shade during the summer. You decide you want to plant one or two. Which type of tree are you planting and why that particular type of tree? You are allergic to grass and had all of it removed from your yard. Describe what you would put in its place. The air conditioner is broken and the repair man won't be available until next week. How would you keep your house cool until it is fixed? Summer means that the kids are usually at home. Would it be better that they were in school during the summer or to have the summer vacation off? With summer time comes hot temperatures. How hot is too hot when it comes to outdoor summer temperatures? What do you do on these too hot days? Name something, other than air conditioning, that you would not want to break during the summer? The Olympics are coming up. If you were an olympian, what sport would you participate in and what would you do to train and prepare?","title":"Summer Table Topics Questions for Toastmasters Meeting"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.29-table-topics-questions/#the-topics","text":"You are the grill master for the upcoming cookout with 100 people.

A number of flowers were present on the vine, but at this time was not bearing any fruit. Have been using the onion chives, despite them having some damage from the water hose hitting and bending them. The tomato plants are doing well. There are actually some tomatoes that have started to ripen on the vine. The only thing about these tomatoes is that they are not large in size. Some of them are smaller than grapes in size. I assume this is because of the amount of sunlight or lack thereof that they are receiving. I did cut back the Mimosa tree branch back so that the garden can receive more sunlight during the midday. Rain barrel collection system has been doing well. I accidently left it open one night and the entire tank drained out. The tank was refilled and overflowed by Tropical Storm Claudette as it passed through the area. The storm did not hang around as it was in an out of the area in about or less than 24 hours.

Kenny\u2019s better half here :) My now fiance and I dated for a little over a year before he popped the question in January. In May I moved in, and in December, we will be married. There are varying opinions regarding when couples should begin living together. Some might argue that moving in together before marriage jeopardizes the relationship, while others might argue that doing so allows the couple to adjust to one another and iron out the kinks before tying the knot. I don\u2019t think that this is a one-size-fits-all answer; the couple has to do what\u2019s best for them. A little history before I continue: In my adult life I have lived alone, with a roommate, and with my immediate family. There are pros and cons to each, and I bring to my romantic relationship a little from each of those types of living arrangements. But never have I ever lived with someone with whom I was in a relationship. This is definitely different from all the rest! So far, living together has been mostly smooth in my opinion. That being said, the experience has not been without its challenges. The top three adjustments I have had to make with respect to my current living situation relate to schedules, habits, and communication. Schedules I moved in right before another major life transition: full-time employment at a hospital. My schedule has ranged from five 8-hour shifts to three 12-hour shifts. I even take call and had to work the overnight shift once. The days of the week that I work change with the wind. Kenny's schedule, on the other hand, is consistent. The adjustment for me has been coordinating who\u2019s going to do what when and also finding time for ourselves and for one another. I try to do my chores in the mornings since I have been consistently on second shift for a few weeks now. I like my days off to truly be my days off if I can help it. Since COVID, Kenny has been working both from home and at the office. When he is at the office, I find time for me. I let him know my schedule in advance when I have it so that we can plan our time together accordingly. This is different for me, as I am used to a little more consistency. And so is he. When we were still in the boyfriend/girlfriend phase, and I was not yet working my current job, I would go over to his place pretty much the same days each week in the evening time and I worked the weekends. Since I was living with my family at the time, I didn\u2019t have to really worry about household chores or really even about cooking regularly. Those weren\u2019t things I had to fit into my schedule because I had people helping me as I put myself through school. It was nice while it lasted. But as I transition into a new role, I find that it has been helpful to navigate what this sort of thing looks like during the engagement phase. I won\u2019t have as much of the figuring out how I\u2019m going to fit certain tasks and responsibilities into my schedule once we\u2019re married. That being said, I am going to school for another degree this fall - which will be yet another adjustment. Habits Habits can be both good and bad. Kenny has a good habit, I guess you could say, of asking me what I want to eat and providing. This is especially good for me, as sometimes I get so caught up that I forget to eat or \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d for it. It is great to come home to food on those long work evenings with no break. He also has a good habit of making sure that we are intentional about spending time together by holding us accountable for our monthly \u201cbig date night.\u201d Kenny does have some bad habits too though. At least that\u2019s how I describe them. He hates doing dishes, so he will let them pile up in the sink. I hate washing them too, but I feel like letting them pile up just makes the chore even worse. He does his own laundry, but he\u2019s not so quick to fold it and put it away. And, of course, he leaves the toilet seat up. I have lived with males for most of my life. But neither of my brothers does that...call me spoiled. The adjustment for me has been having to stop being so indecisive when it comes to what I want to eat or do. I\u2019ve also had to get back in the habit of washing dishes regularly. I haven\u2019t been responsible for dishes in a while, as my mom got her dishwasher fixed a while back. In the effort to \u201cchoose my battles,\u201d I have just learned to fold his clothes when they're done and to put the seat down. I have never done this for other people before. Even when I had roommates, we were still very much responsible for ourselves. When you\u2019re in a relationship though, you do your best to help your partner and do little things to make his/her day a little better or easier. Communication This is something that has come up in our (and probably every couple's) premarital counseling sessions. I am an introverted product of introverted parents. Furthermore, my brothers had social and developmental delays. Needless to say, communication and talking in general have never been my strong suit. And then I struggle with social anxiety on top of that. The adjustment for me has been trying to not be so quiet, which is my default. I remember when were in the pre-engagement phase, Kenny told me that he thought I didn't like him because I'm not \"chatty\" like other girls. I have to be very intentional about saying what's on my mind and talking about my day, as it doesn't come naturally to me. I've noticed about myself that I'm more likely to talk when prompted or asked a question; rarely do I just volunteer information. Most of the time I keep most things to myself, but I am improving and know that our relationship will be stronger for it. To be honest, I mostly moved in when I did out of convenience. I was done with school and wouldn't start working full time for a couple of weeks. All I had was time. While there are more things I've had to adapt to and things that I've encountered that are unlike any other living arrangement I've had, I think we made the right decision for us.","title":"Moving in with My Fiance"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.07.02-moving-in-with-my-fiance/#schedules","text":"I moved in right before another major life transition: full-time employment at a hospital.

That being said, I am going to school for another degree this fall - which will be yet another adjustment.","title":"Schedules"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.07.02-moving-in-with-my-fiance/#habits","text":"Habits can be both good and bad. Kenny has a good habit, I guess you could say, of asking me what I want to eat and providing. This is especially good for me, as sometimes I get so caught up that I forget to eat or \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d for it. It is great to come home to food on those long work evenings with no break. He also has a good habit of making sure that we are intentional about spending time together by holding us accountable for our monthly \u201cbig date night.\u201d Kenny does have some bad habits too though. At least that\u2019s how I describe them. He hates doing dishes, so he will let them pile up in the sink. I hate washing them too, but I feel like letting them pile up just makes the chore even worse. He does his own laundry, but he\u2019s not so quick to fold it and put it away. And, of course, he leaves the toilet seat up. I have lived with males for most of my life. But neither of my brothers does that...call me spoiled. The adjustment for me has been having to stop being so indecisive when it comes to what I want to eat or do. I\u2019ve also had to get back in the habit of washing dishes regularly. I haven\u2019t been responsible for dishes in a while, as my mom got her dishwasher fixed a while back. In the effort to \u201cchoose my battles,\u201d I have just learned to fold his clothes when they're done and to put the seat down. I have never done this for other people before. Even when I had roommates, we were still very much responsible for ourselves. When you\u2019re in a relationship though, you do your best to help your partner and do little things to make his/her day a little better or easier.","title":"Habits"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.07.02-moving-in-with-my-fiance/#communication","text":"This is something that has come up in our (and probably every couple's) premarital counseling sessions. I am an introverted product of introverted parents. Furthermore, my brothers had social and developmental delays. Needless to say, communication and talking in general have never been my strong suit. And then I struggle with social anxiety on top of that. The adjustment for me has been trying to not be so quiet, which is my default. I remember when were in the pre-engagement phase, Kenny told me that he thought I didn't like him because I'm not \"chatty\" like other girls. I have to be very intentional about saying what's on my mind and talking about my day, as it doesn't come naturally to me. I've noticed about myself that I'm more likely to talk when prompted or asked a question; rarely do I just volunteer information. Most of the time I keep most things to myself, but I am improving and know that our relationship will be stronger for it. To be honest, I mostly moved in when I did out of convenience. I was done with school and wouldn't start working full time for a couple of weeks. All I had was time. While there are more things I've had to adapt to and things that I've encountered that are unlike any other living arrangement I've had, I think we made the right decision for us.","title":"Communication"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.07.06-fustigate-toastmasters-word-of-day/","text":"For this meeting, I was the grammarian. The role of the Grammarian is to come up with a word of the day and to track how many times it was used in the meeting. The word I chose for this meeting was \"fustigate\". Merriam-Webster defines it as cudgel to criticize severely Before looking this term up, I did not know what cudgel meant, so I looked it up as well. Come to find out, cudgel means \"a short heavy club\". When originally definited, fustigate meant to beat someone with a stick. I won't get too deep into the Latin and origins of the word. When it was used in the meeting, most fellow Toastmasters used it as a synonym for criticizing severely.","title":"Fustigate, Toastmasters Word of the Day"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.08.01-august-2021.weather/","text":"Weather data as reported from the National Weather Service for the weather station that is cloest to my garden.

You are probably wondering why there has been a drought in content. Well, when running a business, working full time, and having other projects happening at the same time, something has to drop off the burner. In this case, that which was dropped off was me posting content here. Background I have had a blog for many of years now. When you combine the stuff that I have hear, plus the stuff that I have on Facebook before I set up this blog, that's over 10 years worth of content. My goal is to be able to continue to share content on multiple platforms that those who read the blog can benefit from. While I have knowledge of how to run a blog, I want it to be able to do more and to be able to reach a greater and targeted audience. Occasionally I go in the bookstore to see what's there, not because I am actually going in to buy a particular book. As I took my usual stroll to the Technology section, I saw \"Blogging for Dummies\". Before buying the book, I took a peek at what was in the table of contents. I saw that it covered some areas that I was interested in, but had not yet mastered, such as creating good or great content, marketing that content, and using the blog as a source of income. Thus I purchased the book. Why By The Book? Why would you buy a book when you already know the material? Reason being is because books offer a different perspective than what you see online, books allow you to disconnect from the digital devices that consume most, if not all, of our day, and having a bookshelf with no books on it just looks weird. Really it does. As I flipped through the table of contents, I did see some subject areas that I wanted to learn more about that I have not been able to quite master with my online research of these topics. Yes, I could watch many hours of YouTube videos about the topic, but those have not been giving me the info in a way that I find that it can be useful. Construction Ahead As I read the book, which will not be expeditiously, you will see changes made to the blog. I have actually considered doing a layout redesign. The layout redesign is to practice my skills on getting better at UI and UX design, because I know I do not have the designer touch. Some content that you see here, such as that under the Handyman category, maybe moved. I have not gotten far in the book at this point, but do realize that this blog may have casted a wider net than what I wanted when I set things up. You are deleting content? No. Gosh no. The content will still be online, but will move to my business website as that is one of two service areas that the business does. Another objective will be to document things that I have learned from the book and how I go about applying those strategies to this blog as well as my business blog . Conclusion Stay tuned for things to come. It is easy to be complacent with what you already know. However, this is an opportunity for growth for myself that I choose to take on with full force.","title":"Blogging for Dummies"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.11.15-blogging-for-dummies/#blogging-for-dummies","text":"It has been months since I have posted something here.

For example, right now as I am writing this post, it is 1:59 AM. I have been awake for probably the last 30 minutes, but physically got out of bed about 3 minutes ago. Most of the time I can sleep through the night, but at times I am wide awake because of a dream, heard something go bump in the night, or some other reason. Mind on Full Speed In the past, I would just lay in the bed in hopes that I would fall back asleep in a timely manner. Only problem is that my mind would start running at full sped about what tasks I need to accomplish or how to solve some problem that I could not have seem to come up with a solution when I was at work. Having your mind run at full speed when you are trying to go back to sleep is counterproductive. Do Something What I was advised to do by a medical professional is to read a book. Reason being is that for some people, myself included, will put you to sleep because it is rather relaxing and does not require much physical effort and depending on the book, can leave you bored to the point that you bore yourself to sleep. Of course I do not do was is advised. Instead I use this insomnia moments to get stuff done. I try to find tasks that do not result in me making a bunch of noise as I do not want to wake other members of the household. Thus no running of saws or banging of hammers. That leads me to working on other hobbies, like doing stuff on the computer. Resist The Phone You are probably asking just do something on your phone? The reason I avoid using my phone in the middle of the night is because I will be more inclined to get on social media and \"mindlessly scroll\". Knowing what I know about cell phones, the blue light from the phone is known to mimmic daylight, which in turn, your eyes sends signals to your brain (and probably the rest of your body) that it is daytime, thus further making it harder for you to go back asleep. Now what I have done is enabled my phone to go into a night mode between 9 PM and 7 AM. My computer is configured to do the same but at a different time. The \"night mode\" turns the screen an orange-ish color to counteract the blue color that most screens produce, thus reducing the strain on your eyes during the night time hours and that the screen is not as bright. Writing Code For those that are not programmers, I will be honest with you. Programming is a mentally draining activity. Sometimes when I leave work, I have done so much coding in a day, that I feel the \"brain fog\" that some people describe that they have. Because I know that this is a mentally draining task, when I cannot sleep, I will get up and do some coding on whatever project that I have in progress or work on the issues that I have previously created for an existing project. Depending on the intensity of the coding, this will usually lead me to be sleepy again in about an hour or two. At a later point when I am well rested, I do go back and review the code that I wrote when I should have been sleepy. Speaking from experience, you are more likely to make mistakes when you are exhausted, both mentally and physically. Thus why I try to refrain from publishing code in the middle of the night unless I know that I have gotten it correct. Conclusion It is now 2:27 AM. I am starting to feel sleepy again, but not tired enough that I would immediately go to sleep if I laid down. Now that I have completed this post about not sleeping, I am going to do some coding as I have previously mentioned and hopefully will be able to get back to sleep soon.","title":"Be Productive When You Can't Sleep"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.02-be-productive-when-you-cant-sleep/#be-productive-when-you-cant-sleep","text":"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night.

Prior to getting the booster, I got the original shots about 8 months prior. Initially I was not going to get the booster since I did not think that it was necessary. However, after some additional consideration and given the number of activities that I had planned where I would be out around numbers of other people, I decided to proceed with getting it in addition to still wearing my mask. I have logged the outcome from each day after getting the booster. Disclosure I share this information not to pursuade you to get the vaccine or booster, but to share my experience with already having done so. It is possible that you may have a completely different outcome when it comes to getting vaccinated. With COVID almost about to enter its junior year, we all have to do better to make this thing go away. Day 0 Got the injection after work. Could feel some soreness at the injection site. No major pain or anything of that nature. That night, I could not sleep on the side that I got the injection in as it was somewhat painful to the touch and was worse when I laid on it or applied constant pressure. Day 1 The day started off fine. Still had soreness at the injection site, but was not unbearable. When moving my arm to shoulder height or above, I could feel the soreness. Around midday, I began to have chills. This indicated to me that I was probably running a fever, but I did not have a thermometer to check my temperature at the time. Once I got home, I made a chicken-vegetable soup that had chicken, yellow rice, cabbage, carrots, yellow squash, and green squash and took a Tylenol. I did check my temperature and it was slightly elevated around 99.5F, but nothing alarming. I also made an intentional effort to increase my water intake. Day 2 Woke up with slight chills. Took my temperature and it read in the normal range. Thus I did not take a Tylenol since I did not think that I needed it. As the day went on, the chills went away. Still had soreness at the injection site. I would only feel the soreness when I touched the spot or when I raised by arm above shoulder level. Day 3 All was back to normal on this day. was somewhat similar to by body's response after getting the second vaccine shot . Still ahd a little bit of soreness, but nothing that was significant. Conclusion I know there are people that are debating about getting it, theories that COVID is caused by 5G (which it is not), and that it is just a hoax (which it is not). The purpose of this post was not to discuss any of that. The purpose of this post was to share my experience with getting the vaccine booster for those that have not gotten it and/or still skeptic about getting it. I made a post about this on my social media. One person commented that they had no symptoms, while another mentioned that he had a bad reaction because he got the Flu Shot on the same day. For those you who are not aware, it is considered to be a bad practice to get more than one vaccine within a 2 week to 30 day period. Mind you I am not a medical professional. That said, what I understand the reason to by why you do not get vaccines too close together is because your body is already working hard to fighting off one vaccine. To make it have to fight two things off at once when send it into red alert.","title":"COVID-19 Booster Outcome"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.08-covid-booster-outcome/#disclosure","text":"I share this information not to pursuade you to get the vaccine or booster, but to share my experience with already having done so.

Invite Guests You Actually Talk To, Not Just Follow Online In reading \"The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner and Organizer\" by Jessica Bishop, there were a number of suggestions made when it came to planning a wedding. One of which was keep your guest list to people that you have had real conversations with in the last two years. Initially I questioned it, but as I listed the people that I wanted to invite and then narrowed that list down per this suggestion, it significantly cuts down the number of people. In this day and age, it is easy to remain connected to people through social media. Of those people that you are connected to through social media, ask yourself how many of them are you actually close with and have more than an online connection to. When you answer and visualize this question, you'll realize that your circle may not be as big as it seems. The problem with this strategy is that people, including family, who think that they should be invited for whatever reason that they have, may not get an invite. Dealing with this on a case by case situation, some were extended an invite to attend and some remained excluded. Number of Guests When we set our maximum number of guests, we did not want to have a whole heap of people there, but did want to have enough headcount to include closest family and friends. From talking with other people that have had weddings, about 20 to 40 percent of the people that you invite, will not attend. We set our original limit to 100 guests. When we made our initial list of guests, it was about 95. Of that about 80 said that they would attend. After doing the follow up , that number came down to about 68 before including the vendors. When you do the math 68 attendees / 95 invitations = 71.58 % attendee rate Thus about 29 percent of the people that we initially invited, did not attend. There seems to be some truth to the 20 to 40 percent that will not attend. The reason that they do not attend will vary. In our case, some did not attend because they recently started a new job and did not have vacation time or because of the risk of COVID. When counting your guests, be sure to include the vendors where they are needed. Reason is that the vendors will probably want to eat, especially the photographer and coordinators as they will be there before and after the wedding ceremony. Virtual Option There were several guests of mine that were not able to attend for various reasons, but still wanted to see the ceremony. For this, we set up a Zoom meeting and shared the link with these people. I upgraded from the free to the paid plan. At the time of this writing, the lowest cost paid plan is $14.99 per month and allows you to have up to 30 hour meeting with unlimited participants and to be able to record the meeting. We had a videographer that recorded our ceremony. However, I also enabled the meeting to be recorded so that we had another perspective of the wedding. Follow Up on RSVPs We sent out Save the Date and RSVPs about 7 and 4 months respectively ahead of the wedding and got responses. We did a follow up about 1.5 to 2 months before the wedding to make sure that those who had responded that they were attending would still be attending. For some, their situation had not changed and would still be attending. For others, their situation had changed (e.g. new job, financial set back, avoiding gatherings because of new COVID variant) and would not be able to make it. By doing this last minute follow up, it helps to make sure that the number of guests that you are planning for is accurate as close to accurate as possible and that you do not have a lot of empty seats at your wedding. For my wedding, doing the follow up reduced the number of tables that were needed and the amount of food that had to be served. Make A Decision; Avoid Analysis Paralysis What nobody tells you ahead of time is that wedding planning mostly decision making. Here are some of the many questions that had to be answered when it came to my wedding: What wedding colors? What venue? How many in the wedding party? What's the budget? What centerpieces do you want for the table? What kind of food do you want to have? What song for the first dance? Some of these questions, you actually need to give some thought. For example, when it came to the food, we knew some of the guests were vegan and some do not eat pork. Thus we included vegan options when making menu choices and having the meat for reception meal to be centered around chicken. However, other questions, I was tempted to go with the first answer that came to mind or flipping a coin to answer the question. Why? Because it was easier to answer with what you want than to debate on what you want and end up in an Analysis Paralysis situation. We Gotta Pay For That Too? We set up a budget in the beginning. It seemed to be reasonable budget per articles on the internet. As we got about a couple of months before the wedding date, we realized that there were still some things that needed to be purchased and that were not accounted for in the budget. Thus the budget was blown. I believe that part of this was the cost of a number of items had increased in 2021 because of the COVID pandemic and inflation. Thus what we saw online as a reasonable number, ended up being below what everyone who provided that service was charging. To offset this, adjustments had to be made and the budget was revisited and revised several times during the planning process in an effort to make sure that we stayed on track or at least close as possible to on track. Make A To Do List Early in the planning process, I set up a Trello board that had all of the tasks that we needed to do. Based on the timeline, there was one item per week that had to be done. That way there was no rush to get things done and being overwhelmed in the process. Problem with this was that we did not follow the Due Dates that were set on each of the cards. Thus some weeks, multiple items were being worked on at the same time. Since Trello allows you flexibility to do what you want with the boards, we had additional columns for other purposes. Here is the list of columns that we had on our board: To Do - What needs to be done In Progress - what is actively being done On Hold - what has been started but not actively being worked on Done - anything that is completed and does not require further action Articles and References - keeping track of ideas or suggestions Money Spent - track what has been paid by uploading photos of receipts and invoices Point of Contact - track the names and contact information for vendors that you have talked with; backup in case you lose their business card Contracts and Documentation - upload agreements made between you and vendors in case you lose the physical copy Gifts Received - track money or wedding gifts sent so you know who to send a thank you card to after the wedding The bulk of the activity on the board was done within the first 4 columns. Within each card that was in the first 4 columns, a due date was assigned to the task. Having due dates on the task is important because you do not want to end up in a situation where you tell the caterer that you have 200 people, but when you reserve the venue, you find out that it has a max capacity of 150. Enjoy The Experience Ideally, you will only get married once. Thus make the best of the experience and most importantly enjoy it. I will admit there were several times that I had to ask \"Why are we having to deal with this?\" or \"Why are we changing this after it has already been decided?\", but you have to remind yourself what the ultimate and end goal is. By doing that, it helped me to remain focused on the overall goal at hand and not the short term goal and stress from the moment. Do You Really Need A Wedding Coordinator? Do you have to have a wedding coordinator? No. You can easily find the same vendors that coordinators use by going online and searching or by asking for recommendations from others that you know. Does it demand less of you if you do have a wedding coordinator? Yes. One of the main roles the coordinator has is to line up vendors and make sure that each of the individual parts (food, music, decorations, lighting, etc) come together to make the final product great (the wedding). In my opinion, a wedding coordinator is basically a project manager that has experience with weddings. Having gone through the process, I see why some people hire wedding coordinators for this and let them do it all. We chose not to have a coordinator because we felt that it was an additional expense that we could save on by doing it ourselves. We were able to pull everything off through online research and Who Does What? The Vendors What I have found is that some of the vendors that we had, do what they do full time. Thus when you call or email them during a normal business hours, they'll respond almost immediately. Some of them, do what they do part time, similar to the work that I do for my business . Thus they will be delayed in getting back to you or may contact you outside of normal business hours. Regardless if the business is full time or part time, keep in mind that those who actually want your business, will return calls and make things happen. Contracts and Payments When it comes to having vendors, make sure that you have a written agreement that outlines what services will be provided by the vendor and how much you will have to pay for said services. Only make a payment AFTER you have a written agreement in place. For example, my other half found a DJ on a business directory website where businesses can list themselves, similar to a Classifieds section of the news paper. He had good ratings and reviews. She reached out and shared what we were looking to have. After all those discussions were done, he stated that we needed to make a deposit before he would draw up the contract. Me being a business owner would not go for that. I told my other half to let him know that we would need the contract before making the deposit. Few days passed and we did not receive a reply. My other half went back on the website to contact him again, but his business listing was no longer active and never replied to us. In my opinion, that meant one or more had occurred: He was probably up to no good and when he got called out on it, he ran. The reviews he had were probably not authentic. It is rather easy to make multiple profiles on a reviews website (like Yelp or Google My Business), leave several good reviews, and get ranked high That scamming is real and that some will do anything to make a quick buck. That he may have deceived someone else and was kicked off the platform Regardless of what actually happened, things worked out because we had a DJ that did a great job and that was known by several other vendors that we talked to. Friends or Family If you have a friend or family that runs a business offering a service that can be used in your wedding, then consider using them for that service. In some circles, there is this stereotype of not supporting people that are closest to us, even though we have seen and like the work that they have done for others. Instead we will get someone that we do not know, to do a service, and in some cases pay more for that other person to do said service. I do not understand that line of thinking and do believe that it is detrimental. When planning, I thought of those that knew who did what I was looking for. One example is wedding cakes. I knew a couple of people that make and design cakes. One I got a response from and one I did not. The one that did not respond, had apparently overlooked or missed my message and until was not until after I had set things up with the other friend that she had got back to me. Those that are close to you should be willing to help your business and in return, you do the same for them. For example, since one of the cake decorator was a friend, I invited her to the wedding. Then when people came up to me and said how they liked the cake that she had made, I would point them to the decorator and tell them that they can share their thoughts with the decorator directly, to which most of them did. Conclusion Wedding planning can be fun, and stressful. The most important thing is to keep focused on the end goal and to enjoy your partner in the process.","title":"Have A Wedding, Tips and Advice"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#invite-guests-you-actually-talk-to-not-just-follow-online","text":"In reading \"The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner and Organizer\" by Jessica Bishop, there were a number of suggestions made when it came to planning a wedding. One of which was keep your guest list to people that you have had real conversations with in the last two years. Initially I questioned it, but as I listed the people that I wanted to invite and then narrowed that list down per this suggestion, it significantly cuts down the number of people. In this day and age, it is easy to remain connected to people through social media. Of those people that you are connected to through social media, ask yourself how many of them are you actually close with and have more than an online connection to. When you answer and visualize this question, you'll realize that your circle may not be as big as it seems. The problem with this strategy is that people, including family, who think that they should be invited for whatever reason that they have, may not get an invite. Dealing with this on a case by case situation, some were extended an invite to attend and some remained excluded.","title":"Invite Guests You Actually Talk To, Not Just Follow Online"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#number-of-guests","text":"When we set our maximum number of guests, we did not want to have a whole heap of people there, but did want to have enough headcount to include closest family and friends. From talking with other people that have had weddings, about 20 to 40 percent of the people that you invite, will not attend. We set our original limit to 100 guests. When we made our initial list of guests, it was about 95. Of that about 80 said that they would attend. After doing the follow up , that number came down to about 68 before including the vendors. When you do the math 68 attendees / 95 invitations = 71.58 % attendee rate Thus about 29 percent of the people that we initially invited, did not attend. There seems to be some truth to the 20 to 40 percent that will not attend. The reason that they do not attend will vary. In our case, some did not attend because they recently started a new job and did not have vacation time or because of the risk of COVID. When counting your guests, be sure to include the vendors where they are needed. Reason is that the vendors will probably want to eat, especially the photographer and coordinators as they will be there before and after the wedding ceremony.","title":"Number of Guests"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#virtual-option","text":"There were several guests of mine that were not able to attend for various reasons, but still wanted to see the ceremony. For this, we set up a Zoom meeting and shared the link with these people. I upgraded from the free to the paid plan. At the time of this writing, the lowest cost paid plan is $14.99 per month and allows you to have up to 30 hour meeting with unlimited participants and to be able to record the meeting. We had a videographer that recorded our ceremony.

We did a follow up about 1.5 to 2 months before the wedding to make sure that those who had responded that they were attending would still be attending. For some, their situation had not changed and would still be attending. For others, their situation had changed (e.g. new job, financial set back, avoiding gatherings because of new COVID variant) and would not be able to make it. By doing this last minute follow up, it helps to make sure that the number of guests that you are planning for is accurate as close to accurate as possible and that you do not have a lot of empty seats at your wedding. For my wedding, doing the follow up reduced the number of tables that were needed and the amount of food that had to be served.","title":"Follow Up on RSVPs"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#make-a-decision-avoid-analysis-paralysis","text":"What nobody tells you ahead of time is that wedding planning mostly decision making. Here are some of the many questions that had to be answered when it came to my wedding: What wedding colors? What venue? How many in the wedding party? What's the budget? What centerpieces do you want for the table? What kind of food do you want to have? What song for the first dance? Some of these questions, you actually need to give some thought. For example, when it came to the food, we knew some of the guests were vegan and some do not eat pork. Thus we included vegan options when making menu choices and having the meat for reception meal to be centered around chicken. However, other questions, I was tempted to go with the first answer that came to mind or flipping a coin to answer the question. Why? Because it was easier to answer with what you want than to debate on what you want and end up in an Analysis Paralysis situation.","title":"Make A Decision; Avoid Analysis Paralysis"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#we-gotta-pay-for-that-too","text":"We set up a budget in the beginning. It seemed to be reasonable budget per articles on the internet. As we got about a couple of months before the wedding date, we realized that there were still some things that needed to be purchased and that were not accounted for in the budget. Thus the budget was blown. I believe that part of this was the cost of a number of items had increased in 2021 because of the COVID pandemic and inflation. Thus what we saw online as a reasonable number, ended up being below what everyone who provided that service was charging. To offset this, adjustments had to be made and the budget was revisited and revised several times during the planning process in an effort to make sure that we stayed on track or at least close as possible to on track.","title":"We Gotta Pay For That Too?"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#make-a-to-do-list","text":"Early in the planning process, I set up a Trello board that had all of the tasks that we needed to do. Based on the timeline, there was one item per week that had to be done. That way there was no rush to get things done and being overwhelmed in the process. Problem with this was that we did not follow the Due Dates that were set on each of the cards. Thus some weeks, multiple items were being worked on at the same time. Since Trello allows you flexibility to do what you want with the boards, we had additional columns for other purposes. Here is the list of columns that we had on our board: To Do - What needs to be done In Progress - what is actively being done On Hold - what has been started but not actively being worked on Done - anything that is completed and does not require further action Articles and References - keeping track of ideas or suggestions Money Spent - track what has been paid by uploading photos of receipts and invoices Point of Contact - track the names and contact information for vendors that you have talked with; backup in case you lose their business card Contracts and Documentation - upload agreements made between you and vendors in case you lose the physical copy Gifts Received - track money or wedding gifts sent so you know who to send a thank you card to after the wedding The bulk of the activity on the board was done within the first 4 columns. Within each card that was in the first 4 columns, a due date was assigned to the task. Having due dates on the task is important because you do not want to end up in a situation where you tell the caterer that you have 200 people, but when you reserve the venue, you find out that it has a max capacity of 150.","title":"Make A To Do List"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.12.19-have-a-wedding-tips-and-advice/#enjoy-the-experience","text":"Ideally, you will only get married once.

No. You can easily find the same vendors that coordinators use by going online and searching or by asking for recommendations from others that you know.

One of the main roles the coordinator has is to line up vendors and make sure that each of the individual parts (food, music, decorations, lighting, etc) come together to make the final product great (the wedding). In my opinion, a wedding coordinator is basically a project manager that has experience with weddings. Having gone through the process, I see why some people hire wedding coordinators for this and let them do it all.

It was my honeymoon. Given the circumstances of COVID, as COVID is going into its junior year, we were not really sure of when we could actually do a honeymoon and so it was either do it now or wait and we really didn't want to wait. The original plan was to go to Hawaii but Hawaii had at the time more restrictions in place than practically the rest of the United States. Thus we decided maybe we should go somewhere else and that resulted in deciding on going on a cruise since neither of us had been on a cruise before. The scary part about going on a cruise was that the week prior to our departure date the cruises that were coming back to Shore or back to the mainland were COVID positive. One of them actually had 55 cases on board and were denied entry to 2 countries that were part of their stops. They had to continue on their journey and they were given credit for the excursions that they had paid for as well as a voucher I believe for a future Cruise. Having read all of this in the news we decided hey we're still going to go and we're going to pray about everything and hopefully we get there and back safely without getting COVID. Given that the cruise lines had been through this before I believe they already implemented some procedures in place but they may have extended those procedures even further prior to our cruise date so I'm going to talk about my experiences going on a cruise in the pandemic. Before Boarding The Ship As part of going on a cruise with Royal Caribbean one of the requirements is that you had to have a negative COVID test within 2 days prior to your departure date. This became very challenging because of the fact 2 days prior to departure date was Christmas Eve and nobody is giving out a COVID test on Christmas day so we had to get one on Christmas Eve. they strongly advise against getting one on the day of your departure date as it may not necessarily be accurate. However they were administering COVID test on site at the terminal in case you did not have a COVID test prior to arriving at the terminal. Those on-site tests were $105 each and they did not accept any insurance at all so you had to pay for it out-of-pocket. Luckily we were able to get those COVID tests ahead of time and were admitted to board the ship. In addition to having a negative COVID test prior to getting to the terminal you also had to show proof of a completed COVID vaccination. For those that are not eligible such as kids for a COVID vaccination they were still allowed to board but only because of the fact they were not in the group that were able to be vaccinated. Those who are eligible for vaccination, basically anybody over the age of 12 were required to have been vaccinated in order to board the ship. Once that verification process was done after three different individuals looked at the COVID vaccination documentation including the vaccine card and the negative COVID test you were then given a wristband that you were to wear the entire duration of the cruise. This particular wristband you may have had once before which is the type that does not come off once you put it on unless you cut it off. While On The Ship A number of measures were put in place on board the ship. The most noticeable was the use of hand sanitizer stations basically everywhere you looked except in your staterooms. At the elevator, at each of the restaurants, in areas where multiple people would be such as the theater\u2026 all of these places had sanitizer stations at the entrances to them. Furthermore on the first few days of the cruise, cruise staff words actually station next to these hand sanitizer stations and were telling people who walked past them that they had to sanitize their hands before they enter the area. After about the first few days people got the hint and well they just automatically did it going forward for the rest of the cruise. In addition any time that you were inside of the ship in a common area other than your stateroom you were required to wear your mask over your mouth and nose. If you did not have it over your mouth and nose as I saw several people lacking oh, the crew staff within asked you to make sure you pull your mask all the way up and wear it appropriately. There are areas of the ship that you were not required to wear masks and those particular areas were around the pool, on the walking Track, and other areas outside of the ship. When we got aboard the ship, there were several shows of Grease the musical that were to be performed by several of the crew staff. However those first two showings were canceled on the first two days of the cruise. A reason for those cancellations was not provided if I recall correctly but later when they were to be rescheduled for Thursday and Friday the reason was being provided for why those shows would not be performed at all. The reason being was that some of those cast members for Grease the musical actually had COVID and they had been quarantined in their dorm and or staterooms during the entire duration of the cruise. As a consolation to the guests on the cruise they were going to get some of the non COVID positive Cruise staff to perform the musical selections from Grease that they could perform. As far as I know none of the guests got COVID while on the cruise. While At Port During the cruise there were several stops of which was in Mexico one in the Bahamas and one in Honduras. Each of these respective countries had varying levels of what they enforced when it came to preventing the spread of COVID. all of which required that you had to wear your mask out in public unless you were eating or drinking. In some cases like in Mexico you actually had to wear your mask even if you were outside. One of the places that we went to in Mexico actually did temperature checks on the wrist and required that you sanitize your hand before entry. When it came to the Honduras and the Bahamas I did not experience temperature checks or as many hand sanitizing stations or availability like it was in Mexico. Obviously this has something to do with the availability of said items to prevent the spread of COVID blood I believe a lot of that had to do with the leadership of said countries and how they perceive COVID. Conclusion Can you take a cruise during COVID? Yes you can. Is it advisable to do so? Probably not but if you do choose to do so like my wife and I did, be sure that you do everything that is necessary to prevent you from Catching it including wearing your mask and sanitizing and washing your hands regularly if not more often than you are normally used to. Furthermore make sure that you are aware of the behaviors of others and their awareness to prevent you from getting COVID.","title":"I Took A Cruise During The Pandemic"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.01.06-i-took-a-cruise-during-the-pandemic/#before-boarding-the-ship","text":"As part of going on a cruise with Royal Caribbean one of the requirements is that you had to have a negative COVID test within 2 days prior to your departure date.

Furthermore make sure that you are aware of the behaviors of others and their awareness to prevent you from getting COVID.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.01.10-21-days-of-fasting/","text":"Each year for about the last 5 years, during the month of January, I do a fast. The church that I previously attended would do fasting and prayer as a congregation. There are differnet levels of fasting, and suggestions were offered as to the levels of food fasting each person could do. Of course, those wtih medical conditions, should talk to their doctor first before doing anything extreme. For my fast, I always picked a variation of things to fast from. Some included meat, cheese, social media, sodas, and more. Others were opposite and to make a habit to do more of something instead of giving up something. You can read about what I did for my 2020 fast and 2019 fast . The goals 2022 Fasting Objectives As for 2022, things that I will be doing during this year's fast. My objective is to provide regular updates to this post. No Meat In the past, I have found that I feel different, like more energized, when have not eaten meat for the 21 day period. In addition, I have lost weight, give or take 10 pounds, around my midsection without changing my exercise routine. Going further by doing no cheese at the same time, makes even more weight come off. I am not a dietician, but my theory on this and the documentaries that I have seen, that meat takes longer to digest and process out of the body. Thus a lot of us that heavily eat meat and less vegetables (in other words the typical American diet) are carrying around dead weight and excess fat from eating so much meat. Now there are vegetarians and vegans that are fat, but that is not solely because of what they eat. Daily Scripture Reading the Bible offers wisdom and knowledge. I had not been doing this judiciously in 2021, so I want to make a change in this habit. I have two Bible apps on my phone and sometimes I dismiss the daily notification to read a scripture. Will not do that during this period in hopes to make reading the Word a regular habit. Pack A Lunch After making all the payments to have a wedding in 2021, I need to recoup my finances and start taking a lunch. When I do cook, I have a tendency to cook too much and thus can eat it for a day or two afterwards. Furthermore, the cost of everything has gone up since the pandemic. Inflation, inflation, in-fla-tion. I remember when the small back of chips were 25 cents. Now those similar size bags, because they have reduce the size of the bag so that people still buy them instead of increasing the cost, cost 75 cents in some stores. Completing More Projects Before Starting New Ones I realize that I have a lot of ideas and goals to accomplish. Problem is that I regularly start something, and can be hesistant to complete it. For example, my house has knee walls. In some parts of the wall, the insulation has fallen out from the wall cavity. I purchased some insulation in early 2020 with the intention of replacing the worn, squirrrel-chewed insulation with new insulation and enclosing it in the wall cavity. That insulation is in the same spot and in the original packaging from when I brought it home after purchasing it. Smh at myself. Thus my goal during this time and this year, is to work on these in progress projects, both coding and home improvement, before starting new ones. I will be posting these projects on my business YouTube channel and Facebook page , and Instagram page . Intermittent Fasting, 8 hour window In the past, I have done intermittent fasting with a 12 hour window. I am looking to get that down to an 8 hour window. Having a shorter window means that your body runs more off of stored fat and less off of the foods that you are immediately consuming. Burning that stored fat, means you will have a smaller midsection, as it is easy for the body to store fat there since it is near the stomach, liver, and intestines where food is processed. Day 1 - January 10 Ended up buying a lunch today since I did not cook a dinner that did not have meat the day before. That lunch consisted of eating collard greens, corn, cornbread, and fried okra. I did avoid meat and cheese on this day. Day 2 - January 11 Day went well. Another day without cheese and meat. Had a salad for lunch and some soft tacos based on a recipe from \"Thug Kitchen: Eat Like You Give a F**k\". I have had the book for several years, but never made a recipe from it. Thus the wife making this recipe was the first time that something from it was actually made. In addition to the food aspect, I've only drunk water today and did keep my food consumption within an 8 hour window. Slept great last night, but I think that was because of the outcome of the National Championship game and no I'm not going to talk about it. Day 4 - January 13 Have not been able to focus on some tasks. Thinking that may be a time management issue, or just having a general lack of focus. I attend the first of a multi-week course that is related to digital marketing and branding. I feel that attending this course will help me in a number of areas including the YouTube channel and building business brand online. Have managed to continue to stick with nto eating meat.","title":"21 Days of Fasting"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.01.10-21-days-of-fasting/#2022-fasting-objectives","text":"As for 2022, things that I will be doing during this year's fast.

Home Assistant does not (in May 2021) have the ability to check the status of the Ecobee API. It only just makes calls to the API. Solution Since Ecobee had a couple of issues within the last couple of weeks when I attempted to make changes to the thermostat, I decided to build an automation that would update an indicator in Home Assistant to whether the Ecobee API status page was showing that everything is operational. If the \"All Systems Operational\" message is not shown on the Ecobee status page, then the Ecobee API Status indicator in Home Assistant is set to false. From there, automations can be triggered based on the state of the API. If the previously stated message is shown on the page, then the Home Assistant sensor will show true. Technology This application was written with .NET Core 3.1 and Selenium WebDriver. Using Webdriver, it goes to the Ecobee API Status website and checks the text on the page. Then it updates the local Home Assistant instance based on whether it is true or false. This automation runs once per 10 minutes, but can be configured to run at other intervals. Installation Copy The Files Within VS Code, I have a task that does the deployment for me. That task does a build with release configuration and ssh file copy to the server that the code will be running from with a single command. You can see the tasks.json file to see how this is done. System Service To have the application run on startup, I have configured it to run as a system service. To do this, you will need to do the following. iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo cp almostengr.ecobeestatus.service /lib/systemd/system iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl enable almostengr.ecobeestatus.service Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/almostengr.ecobeestatus.service \u2192 /lib/systemd/system/almostengr.ecobeestatus.service. iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl start almostengr.ecobeestatus.service Last step is to confirm that the process is running. iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl status almostengr.ecobeestatus.service \u25cf almostengr.ecobeestatus.service - Ecobee Status Monitor by almostengr Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/almostengr.ecobeestatus.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Tue 2021-05-04 06:48:20 CDT; 12s ago Docs: https://thealmostengineer.com/ecobeestatus Main PID: 223570 (Almostengr.Ecob) Tasks: 10 (limit: 38350) Memory: 35.2M CGroup: /system.slice/almostengr.ecobeestatus.service \u2514\u2500223570 /home/iamadmin/ecobeestatus/Almostengr.EcobeeStatus May 04 06:48:20 media systemd[1]: Started Ecobee Status Monitor by almostengr. appsettings.json Provided with the code is the appsettings.template.json file. This file has all of the properties in it that are needed to run, but you have to enter the corresponding values for your installation. { \"Logging\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\", \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\", \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\" } }, \"AppSettings\": { \"HomeAssistant\": { \"Url\": \"<HA IP address>\", \"Token\": \"<HA token>\" }, \"EcobeeStatusUrl\": \"https://status.ecobee.com\" } } \"HA IP Address\" - this value should have the web address (with http or https included) to access your Home Assistant instance. \"HA token\" - this value needs to be replaced with the long-time token from Home Assistant. This token can be generated by logging into Home Assistant and going to your user profile. The other properties in the file do not need to be changed. If you would like additional logging to be done, then you can change the corresponding logging settings. Uninstall To remove the application as a service, run the commands below. iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl disable almostengr.ecobeestatus iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl stop almostengr.ecobeestatus iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl status almostengr.ecobeestatus iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/almostengr.ecobeestatus Once you have ran the above commands, then you can remove the application files from the directory that you installed them in. Troubleshooting Incorrect Path in Service File I did encounter an error when setting up the system service. The problem was that the path that I had entered in the service file was incorrect. As a result, the daemon could not call the program to start. Below is the output that you will see if you have this error. The solution is to stop the service from running, fix the path in the service file, and then start the service again. iamadmin@media:~/ecobeestatus$ sudo systemctl status almostengr.ecobeestatus.service \u25cf almostengr.ecobeestatus.service - Ecobee Status Monitor by almostengr Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/almostengr.ecobeestatus.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Tue 2021-05-04 06:46:10 CDT; 3s ago Docs: https://thealmostengineer.com/ecobeestatus Process: 223446 ExecStart=/home/iamadmin/ecobeestatus (code=exited, status=203/EXEC) Main PID: 223446 (code=exited, status=203/EXEC) May 04 06:46:10 media systemd[1]: almostengr.ecobeestatus.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 5.

Those updates include posting the current song and providing alerts when problems are detected. This application is ONLY designed to run on Falcon Pi Players that are installed on Raspberry Pi, but it may be possible to run it on Beagle Bone Black (BBB). Technologies: C#, Twitter Year Started: 2020 Problem I wanted to have a way for the visitors to my light show are able to find out the information about the song that was currently playing. Some other Light Show Creators use screens or equipment that will display the song information on a visitor's radio using RDS (Radio Data System). Solution I did not want to have to invest heavy into this project, so after I found out that Falcon Pi Player came with an API, I decided to build a .NET Core application that would post the song information to Twitter. Then create a PSA (Public Service Announcement) in my show that lets visitors know about the Twitter page and that song and show information is available on this page. While most of the plugins for Falcon Pi Player are written in PHP or Shell (Bash) Script, this application was originally written in .NET Core 3.1 and now uses .NET 5. While I do know how to program in PHP and Bash, C# and .NET Core is what I primarily use. Thus using this language and framework for the application. Twitter Example Follow my Light Show account @hplightshow to see what this application can do. System Requirements In order to use Falcon Pi Twitter, you will need to have an internet connection a Twitter developer account Falcon Pi Player version 4 (confirmed working and tested with version 4.6.1) Installation Steps Download the latest release from the project repo that is available in zip or tar format. Copy the archive file to your Falcon Pi Player instance(s). Extract the archive file contents. Ideally extract them to a folder in the /home/fpp directory. Login to your Twitter Developer Account . Once your account is approved, create a project. Within that project, create Consumer Key (aka API Key), Consumer Secret (aka API Secret), Access Token and Access Secret. Also within that project, update the App Permissions to \"Read and Write\". By default, permissions are \"Read\", which does not permit posting tweets. Copy appsettings.template.json to appsettings.json . Add the key, secrets, and token that you got from your Twitter developer account to the appsettings.json file. See the Configuration section for explainations and details. Create a system service that will run the applicaton on startup. Reboot your Raspberry Pi Once the Pi has come back online, log in and check the log file to confirm that the monitor has started. You should see output similar to the below near the beginning of the log file. Connected to Twitter as HP Light Show The \"Connected to Twitter\" message in the log file, confirms that your account has been properly configured to access Twitter. If there are exception messages in the log, double check the configuration file and your internet connection. System Service This application is designed to be run as a system service. Below are the steps to install or remove it. Create System Service To install the system service, run the below commands. Note that the commands are designed to be ran from the directory that you have copied the application files to. sudo cp falconpitwitter.service /lib/systemd/system sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable falconpitwitter sudo systemctl start falconpitwitter sudo systemctl status falconpitwitter Remove System Service To uninstall the system service, run the below commands sudo systemctl disable falconpitwitter sudo systemctl stop falconpitwitter sudo systemctl status falconpitwitter sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/falconpitwitter.service System Service Logs To see the output from the logs, visit the Troubleshooting section. CronJob This application is designed to run as a system service. However, it can run as a cronjob. See the Creating System Service page for details. Create a cronjob that runs on reboot. On your FPP, open a SSH session. Once logged in, enter crontab -e When the text editor opens, add the following to the bottom of the file. Change the directory to match where you extracted the FP Monitor. @reboot /home/fpp/fpmonitor/falconpitwitter > /home/fpp/media/logs/falconpitwitter.log 2>&1 Then save and exit the text editor. Configuration To get started, copy the appsettings.template.json file to a file named appsettings.json . Then update the JSON file to have the values that you would like. The details for each setting are mentioned below. appsettings.json File Breakdown The appsettings.json file has multiple configuration values in it. Each of the sections below describe what values are expected in the file and how to configure them accordingly. \"MonitorOnly\": false, When set to false , this will tweet out song information in addition to alerts. When set to true , this will only tweet out alerts. (no song information) When no value is provided, the application will default to false . \"Twitter\": { \"ConsumerKey\": \"8W4tZQ6xp7\", \"ConsumerSecret\": \"qJz6nDw2T7\", \"AccessToken\": \"KBiEB6jn28\", \"AccessSecret\": \"8nftJzHOAI\", }, This section holds the values to access the Twitter API. Visit the Twitter for Developers page to sign up and get the needed keys an tokens. You will need to get a Consumer Key (aka API Key), Consumer Secret (aka API Secret), Access Token and Access Secret for this section. When no value is provided for any of the properties, the application will display and error and will not run. \"FalconPiPlayerUrls\": [ \"http://localhost\" ], List each of the Falcon Pi Player that you want to be monitored. If you are using a master-remote setup, then the master instance, which has the music and sequence files, needs to be listed first. All remote instances need to be listed after. The URLs can be the hostname or the IP address to each player. If your FPP does not have an assigned or static IP address, then it is recommended to use the hostname. \"Alarm\": { \"TwitterAlarmUser\": \"@XrGOEz2Wc7\", \"MaxTemperature\": 55.0, \"MaxAlarms\": 5 } TwitterAlarmUser should be the name of the Twitter account(s) that can be mentioned if there is an issue with the show (e.g. Raspberry Pi having high CPU temperature). Value needs to include the at (@) symbol. When no value has been provided, then alerts will show up as public tweets instead of mentions. MaxTemperature should be the threshold that has to be reached before a high temperature alert is triggered. In warmer climates, you will want to set this value higher to prevent false alerts. This value needs to be in degrees Celsius. Per the Raspberry Pi documentation, 60 to 65 degrees Celsius is close to the safe upper operating limit of the Pi. When no value has been provided, this will default to 55.0 degrees. MaxAlarms is the number alarms that you will be notified about within an hour. Once this threshold has been reached, you will not be notified again until the next hour. The alarms will still be reported in the application log. To receive infinite alerts, set this value to 0 . When no value has been provided, this will default to 5 alerts per hour. Example appsettings.json File Once you have finished updating the appsettings.json file, it should look similar to the example below. { \"Logging\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\", \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\", \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\" } }, \"AppSettings\": { \"MonitorOnly\": false, \"Twitter\": { \"ConsumerKey\": \"8W4tZQ6xp7\", \"ConsumerSecret\": \"qJz6nDw2T7\", \"AccessToken\": \"KBiEB6jn28\", \"AccessSecret\": \"8nftJzHOAI\", }, \"FalconPiPlayerUrls\": [ \"http://localhost\" ], \"Alarm\": { \"TwitterAlarmUser\": \"@XrGOEz2Wc7\", \"MaxTemperature\": 55.0, \"MaxAlarms\": 5 } } } Troubleshooting Exception on First Run An exception may occur and written in the log if the Wifi or ethernet connection has not been established before the first run. Confirm in the log that HttpRequestException is not repeating in the logs after 2 or 3 attempts. If the message continues to appear, double check your Wifi or ethernet connection to the internet. System Service Output / Log To see the logged output from the system service, login to FPP via SSH and run the command: journalctl -u falconpitwitter -b If an error occurs in the application, the exception message will show here. Issue Queue Additional bugs that you discover should be reported to the project Issues Queue . FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) Tweeting Song Information This application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the meta data for the song that is current playing. Then it uses that information to compose a tweet. If the song that is playing does not have ID3 tag information entered, then will not display part or all of the song data. If you need to add the song meta data to the file, you can use a program like Audacity to do so. Tweeting Alarms (or Alerts) The application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the current temperature of the Raspberry Pi. If it is above the threshold that is specified in the appsettings.json file, then it will send a tweet that mentions the users specified in the appsettings.json file a message to let them know if the current temperature. How frequently are checks done? Songs are checked every 15 seconds to see if it has changed. If the same song is playing from the previous check, then no tweet is posted. Vitals are checked every 5 minutes. Alarms are based on the settings that you have defined in the configuration file . I don't want certain playlists to post song information. How do I accomplish this? Any playlist that has \"offline\" or \"testing\" (case insensitive) in the name of it, will not post the song information to Twitter. The vitals alarms can still be triggered when \"offline\" or \"testing\" playlists are active. Where is the source code? Source code for this project is hosted on Github . The latest release can also be downloaded from here. \"Are you connected to internet? HttpRequest Exception occured\" shows in the log. What does this mean? This means that your Falcon Pi Player instance attempted to connect to the internet or another device but was not able to do so. Double check your network and internet connection to ensure that data can be sent. Also double check your configuration file as the hostname(s) may be incorrect or mistyped. Why did you build a standalone application instead of an FPP plugin? I work as a software developer primarily building web-based applications in C#. Based on what I have seen, most (if not all) of the FPP plugins are build with PHP. While I do know PHP and have worked with it in the past, I chose to go with building a C# application. as it gave me an opportunity to use my existing skills and expand them by applying them to something different than what I am used to. I have a question not answered. Where do I ask it? Please file an issue on the repo with your comment, question, or bug report. You may also send a message to the developer or the HP Light Show account.","title":"Falcon Pi Twitter"},{"location":"projects/falcon-pi-twitter/#falcon-pi-twitter","text":"This project is designed for Falcon Pi Player to provide updates via Twitter on the light show that you are running.

For example, when the soil is dry, then water the plants. When the greenhouse is hot, then turn on the fans. When it cant address a problem, then a notification is sent to a human to intervene. This project is in progress at this time. Once the project has been completed, documentation will be completed and more information about the project will be provided.

Also makes sure that the internet modem is online and can reach external websites. The status is then reported to Home Assistant via API. Year Started: 2020 Technologies: C# Problem My router would occasionally disconnect any of the wireless clients that were connected to it. Since I have wired and wireless devices connected, some of the time I would not know that the wifi had stopped working until my phone or laptop wouldn't connect or I noticed that a automation did not trigger when it should have. Solution After updating to the latest DD-WRT firmware, the problem persisted. Given that I work building automations to improve business processes, I decided that I would build and automation that would connect to the router\u2019s web interface and see if there are any wireless clients connected to it. If there are no connected wireless clients, then there is a great chance that the wifi process that authenticates clients has crashed. As a result, the process would need to be restarted and the easiest way to restart the process would be to reboot the router. The Technology This solution uses Selenium Webdriver to connect to the DD-WRT router web interface.

Often times, that thermostat is on the first floor and can properly manage the temperature on the first floor. However, the second floor often times gets too hot because heat rises and cold air sinks. Several houses in the neighborhood have window AC units installed in the rooms on the upper floor of their house and so do I. The thing about the window units is that they have basic thermometers on them. Thus I built a .NET Core application that will read the temperature from a temperatture sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. Home Assistant has been configured to connect to the Raspberry Pi via API to get the current temperature. Then based on automation rules, will either turn on or off the window air conditioner units. I have several Rapsberry Pi (or Raspberry Pis) that are used in my home and used as television set top boxes. Instead of purchasing additional devices to detect temperature, I decided to get some one-wire temperature sensors that can be connected to the Raspberry Pi that is already in the rooms that I want to monitor. The application was build using .NET 5.0 Web API template. The way it works is that a GET call is made to the API. The API runs a process to get the current temperature from the temperature sensor and then returns it back to the caller as a JSON object. That JSON object returns the Fahrenheit and Celsuis temperature readings.

Basics How do you keep the lights from shorting or tripping breakers during wet weather? Each connection that is in contact with the ground is wrapped in electrical tape. That prevents water from reaching the connections, which would result in an electrical short, thus tripping the breaker. Outlets and plugs that are not on the ground, are pointed downwards so that water cannot enter the socket and taped to prevent water from getting in. Are there other residential light shows? Yes, there are many that exist. There are also commercial light shows. See the list below. Those with \"MGM\" in parenthesis are located in or near the Montgomery, Alabama area. Visit their respective pages for details about their show. Broomfield Lights Burton Family Light Show Canispater Christmas Christmas on the Coosa (MGM) Christmas Wonderland Lighting Up Paxton Lights To A Beat Listen To Our Lights Map of Light Displays MKE Lights Montgomery Christmas Lights (MGM) Moss Lights Percivals Christmas Lights and Santaland & Clark Wannabe (MGM) Riparian Lights San Jose Lights Tara Lights (MGM) The Christmas Light Show The Minion House (MGM) Thyno Zgouvas' Christmas Wonderland (MGM) Way Off Broadway Lights (MGM) Wetumpka Griswold Christmas (MGM) Woodard Family Lights Why did you start doing this? I wanted to do something different for Christmas. Given that the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic was happening during 2020, I had extra funds on hand since I was not doing much travelling during this time. I decided to leverage my Technology and Electrical Engineering skills and build a Christmas light show. Money How much does it cost to run the light show? Your electric bill must be high! Short Answer Since LEDs are used for the entire light show, it is not high at all. To run the show for 5 weeks, with all the lights on (2,130 LEDs used in 2020) would cost a maximum of $38.90. Given that all the lights are not all the entire time and the equipment is not running at max capacity (which hardly ever happens), the actual cost is less than this. See Do The Math for the breakout and how this cost was derived. Long Answer - Do The Math With all lights turned on (2,130 LEDs were used for the 2020 Light Show), it pulls 130 Watts. The show controller and components can pull a maximum of 305 Watts. Thus the show in total can use 435 (130 + 305) Watts maximum. The lights run for 33.5 hours per week (Sunday through Thursday, 4.5 hours; Friday and Saturday, 5.5 hours). Sun through Thurs hours = 4.5 hours * 5 days = 22.5 hours Fri and Sat hours = 5.5 hours * 2 days = 11 hours 11 + 22.5 = 33.5 hours The show runs for 5 weeks during the Christmas season. The controller runs 168 hours per week (24 hours per day). Electric companies measure the amount of electricity that you use in kilowatt-hours. To convert W (Watts) to kWh (kilowatt-hours), you have to compute the lights and controller separately since they are on for different durations. E(kWh lights) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 130 Watts * 33.5 hours / 1000 = 4.355 kWh E(kWh controller) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 435 Watts * 168 hours / 1000 = 73.08 kWh The rate for electricity (in 2020) during the winter months (Oct-May) is $0.100511 per kWh. Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44 Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34 Since we have the cost for each group of components, we can compute the cost per week and per season. Cost per week = $0.44 + $7.34 = $7.78 Cost per season (5 weeks) = $7.78 * 5 = $38.90 That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is $7.78 and cost for the season is $38.90. Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount. You built a control box for your show. How much did that cost? A total of $332.59 (all purchased in 2020). I did have some items already on hand from existing projects that I was able to use for this project. For those items, I used the current cost for those items. This doesn't include the wood, nails, or paint that I used to build the control box or the AC lights that I already had on hand. What are the parts that I need to build my own control box? This is the list of the electrical related components. The full list of components will vary depending upon how to you choose to design your control box. The prices were how much the items costed in 2020. Fuse holders (x24) = $7.50 Fuses (rated 2 Amps) (x30) = $17.97 8-channel solid state relays (x2) = $9.33 SPT-2 male plugs (x25) = $23.99 SPT-2 female plugs (x25) = $23.99 FM transmitter = $12.49 Raspberry Pi 3 = $40.00 Assorted breadboard wires (x40) = $7.49 3.5mm audio cable = $5.99 Outlets (used) (x12) = $6.00 Outlet boxes and outlet faceplates (x6) = $12.00 14 gauge wire (25 ft) = $12.73 16 gauge wire (25 ft) = $8.98 SPT-2 18 gauge 150 ft spools (x2) = $94.13 Additional AC lights (10 strands, 100 lights each) = $50.00 Total = $332.59 All prices are listed in USD. Does not include taxes or shipping fees. Technology What kind of hardware do you use? Raspbery Pi The Falcon Pi Player is installed on the Raspberry Pi. The Rasberry Pi controls the relays, which in turn controls all of the lights. The Pi controls each of the 24 channels of relays via the GPIO pins that it has. Christmas Lights All of the lights are LED. Only two colors are used for the light show, white and red. Solid State Relays All of the relays are Solid State Relays (SSR). SSRs were used because they have no mechanical or moving parts and having greater reliability for being switched on and off frequently. Mechanical relays heat up from switching on an off. When done repeatedly, like during a song, the relay can actually over heat and weld itself together. FM Radio Transmitter Music is transmitted over radio via a low-power FM transmitter. Music goes into the transmitter directly from the Raspberry Pi and broadcasted on 90.3 FM. Radio Locator mentioned below was used to locate the best frequency based on the area. What kind of software do you use? Xlights The music and light sequences are timed together using Xlights. This software is open source and runs on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can download the latest release from the repository . For assistance with configuring or issues with xLights, you can post in the Official xLights Support Group . Falcon Pi Player (FPP) Once the sequences have been created in Xlights, those files are copied over to FPP. From there, the show data files, music files, and scheduling are all connected within this software. You can download the latest release from the repository . For assistance with configuring or issues with Falcon Pi Player, you can post in the FPP, Falcon Player group. Kdenlive Kdenlive is a video editing tool. It can also be used to modify audio files. The show intro audio file was modified with Kdenlive to have the voice over and background music on the same track. You can download the latest version from its website . Falcon Pi Twitter Falcon Pi Twitter is a custom .NET Core application written in C#. The application serves as a bridge between the Falcon Pi Player and Twitter. As the show plays, the song information is pulled from the Falcon Pi Player and then posted as a tweet on Twitter. You can find out more information about this project by visiting the project page . Song updates are posted to Twitter. How does that work? See the Falcon Pi Twitter page for more information about that project. What is the legality of using an FM transmitter for light shows? The answers will vary depending on who you ask in the light show community. From my understanding and online research regarding the matter, it breaks down to following these guidelines: Don't broadcast on a frequency that another station is already broadcasting on in your area. This will get you in immediate trouble as those who listen to the licensed station will report the interference. If an investigation is done and you are caught, you will be in hot water with the FCC and subject to fines and/or imprisonment. Don't broadcast further than necessary Nobody is going to be watching your light show 1/2 mile away from your house, especially if you live inside of city limits or in a subdivision. When you set up your transmitter, drive around and see how far the signal reaches. If you are two streets over and can still hear it clearly, but cannot see your house, then you need to lower the amplification of your signal or position your antenna so that the signal does not travel as far. Turn it off when not being used (non-light show season) It does not make sense to leave a light on in a room with nobody in it. The same goes for your FM transmitter. When it is not being used, turn it off. Resources Where can I find out more information or ask questions?

To run the show for 5 weeks, with all the lights on (2,130 LEDs used in 2020) would cost a maximum of $38.90. Given that all the lights are not all the entire time and the equipment is not running at max capacity (which hardly ever happens), the actual cost is less than this. See Do The Math for the breakout and how this cost was derived.","title":"Short Answer"},{"location":"projects/christmas-light-show/faq/#long-answer-do-the-math","text":"With all lights turned on (2,130 LEDs were used for the 2020 Light Show), it pulls 130 Watts. The show controller and components can pull a maximum of 305 Watts. Thus the show in total can use 435 (130 + 305) Watts maximum. The lights run for 33.5 hours per week (Sunday through Thursday, 4.5 hours; Friday and Saturday, 5.5 hours). Sun through Thurs hours = 4.5 hours * 5 days = 22.5 hours Fri and Sat hours = 5.5 hours * 2 days = 11 hours 11 + 22.5 = 33.5 hours The show runs for 5 weeks during the Christmas season. The controller runs 168 hours per week (24 hours per day). Electric companies measure the amount of electricity that you use in kilowatt-hours. To convert W (Watts) to kWh (kilowatt-hours), you have to compute the lights and controller separately since they are on for different durations. E(kWh lights) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 130 Watts * 33.5 hours / 1000 = 4.355 kWh E(kWh controller) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 435 Watts * 168 hours / 1000 = 73.08 kWh The rate for electricity (in 2020) during the winter months (Oct-May) is $0.100511 per kWh. Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44 Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34 Since we have the cost for each group of components, we can compute the cost per week and per season. Cost per week = $0.44 + $7.34 = $7.78 Cost per season (5 weeks) = $7.78 * 5 = $38.90 That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is $7.78 and cost for the season is $38.90. Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount.","title":"Long Answer - Do The Math"},{"location":"projects/christmas-light-show/faq/#you-built-a-control-box-for-your-show-how-much-did-that-cost","text":"A total of $332.59 (all purchased in 2020).

Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. For example, most future engineers are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate future engineers about the impact that computers and computer programming has with society. This project targets the \"T, E, and M\" of \"STEM\" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions. Teach Software Versioning One of the goals of this project is to be able to teach the next generation of engineers about the programming, software versioning, and how valuable engineers and technologists are to society and the impact that they have. A game was developed to be combined with this project to teach about software versioning, how sometimes Software Developers don't get it right the first time, and the negative impact that can occur if they don't get it right the first time. Below is the image of a group of future engineers working their way to developing the psuedocode for a normal traffic cycle. As shown in the first version, all of the lights turned on but never turned off. In the final version, they figured out that they had to turn on and turn off each light as well as include a delay in between each light change. Parts List Below are the list of parts used for this project. You'll need to choose one of the mentioned options below depending on your budget. Using LEDs is cheaper than getting an actual traffic light. Raspiberry Pi 3 Kit (May work on other models, but has only been tested on Raspberry Pi 3) Micro SD card (to run the OS and store project files) USB keyboard (mouse optional) HDMI display Breadboard Jumper Cables Breadboard (optional) Python 2.7.9 (May work with later versions, but has only been tested with 2.7.9) Raspberry Pi OS Jessie, Stretch, or Buster (May work on other OSs, but has only been tested with Raspberry Pi OS Jessie) LED Option Red LED Yellow LED Green LED Real Traffic Light Option Relay board(s) with at least 3 channels Traffic Light Installation and Setup Install Raspberry Pi OS You will need to install Raspberry Pi OS on your SD. Once you have completed this install, Then you can insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on. To install Raspberry Pi OS using Ubuntu, I made a video tutorial which you can watch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1_MWWlkNI . Pin Setup Below is the mapping for the connections to the Raspberry Pi. The Pin numbers listed are the physical pin numbers on the board, not the GPIO pin numbers. If you are not using a relay board, the connections can be made directly to a breadboard with LEDs connected.

If you see error messages when running the commands, you may need to run them with \"sudo\" privileges. See the System Service page for details on how to add or remove the application as a system service. Create System Service sudo cp almostengrtrafficpiweb.service /lib/systemd/system sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable almostengrtrafficpiweb.service sudo systemctl start almostengrtrafficpiweb.service sudo systemctl status almostengrtrafficpiweb.service Run App On Pi To run the applicatoin via the command line (not using the system service), then you can run the commands below. cd trafficpi ./Almostengr.TrafficPi.Web To exit the application after running it via command line, press Ctrl+C. Video Demonstration Video demonstration of version 1.0 of the project is available to be watched at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_ZJNX0viM . This version of the demonstration of the traffic light working with an LCD screen connected. Further discussion of the traffic light code can be watched at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBnWOX3wGE . Controller Technology The controller currently uses .NET Core 3.1. Tt is a multi-project application. User Interface (UI) / Front End The user interface is a .NET Core MVC application. When you select the program that you want to run from the application home page, the application then runs a linux command that runs the back end program. When the program is changed on the front end, the back end program is then terminated and the newly select program is started. Relay Control / Back End The back end of the application is a .NET Core Worker Service. The program modes are defined within this worker service. The worker service will continue running until it is terminated by the front end application or by a user via the command line or SSH. Source Code The source code for this project can be downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/almostengr/trafficpi . Uninstall Traffic Pi Remove System Service To remove the application as a system service, run each of the commands below. sudo systemctl disable almostengrtrafficpiweb.service sudo systemctl stop almostengrtrafficpiweb.service sudo systemctl status almostengrtrafficpiweb.service sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/almostengrtrafficpiweb.service After running all of the commands above, then reboot the system.

To make this more challenging, \u201cLight on\u201d and \u201cLight off\u201d can be two separate commands.","title":"Goals and Instructions"},{"location":"projects/traffic-pi/electricaltheory/","text":"Relays Relays are used when devices of different voltages or amperages are being used together. One common example of this is relays that are used to control headlights on a car. The switch inside the vehicle has a lower amperage and is considered to be a \"signal wire\". When the switch is turned on, a relay is closed which then connects a different circuit to turn on and off the headlights. In the Traffic Pi project, relays are used in a similar manner. The Raspberry Pi outputs 3.3VDC from the GPIO pins. Those pins are connected to a relay board. The relay board is also connected to a 120VAC which is needed by each of the signals. When the Pi sends an \"on\" signal to the relay board, the relay activates, thus sending 120VAC from the source (in this case a wall outlet) to the signal and then corresponding signal then turns on. Wires Wire Color Standards The color of each wire always denotes its purpose. When using different color wires, you don't need to have a tag on each wire. Instead, you create a service manual or other documentation that lists the purpose of each wire based on its color. For example, if you look a wiring harness on a car, you will notice that it has a number of wires that are bundled together. Each of those wires has a purpose. The vehicle manufacturers create a document, often referred to as a service manual, that lists each of the colors of the wire in the harness and their purpose. AC Circuits Wire Color With an AC circuit, there are commonly 3 wires. Black, white, and bare copper or green. Black wire in AC circuit represents the \"hot\" or supply voltage. White wire in AC Circuit represents the neutral. Green or bare copper wire in AC Circuit represents the ground. DC Circuits Wire Color With a DC Circuit, there are two wires. Red and black. Red wire in DC circuit represents the positive. This is the voltage that comes from the power source. Black wire in DC circuits represents the negative. This is the voltage that goes back to the power source. AC vs DC Alternating Current (AC) The current in an AC system alternates between the hot and neutral wires. The frequency at which this occurs varies. In North America (including the United States), the alternation takes place at 60 Hertz (Hz) or 60 times per second. In other parts of the world, this alternation takes place at 50 Hz per second. AC circuits are commonly used for items that require a lot of power to operate. These include large motors, like the ones used in AC refrigeration and industrial machines. Direct Current (DC) DC circuits are commonly used for battery powered systems, electronics, and other devices that do not require a lot of power to operate. If a device, such as a cell phone or streaming player, has a \"power brick\", then that device runs on DC power. The power brick converts the AC power to DC power and at the same time reduces the voltage to what the device needs.","title":"Electrical Theory"},{"location":"projects/traffic-pi/electricaltheory/#relays","text":"Relays are used when devices of different voltages or amperages are being used together.

This is a quick reference for the commands that are most commonly used when working with Git. A description of what each command does if executed, is provided under each command. Commands git init Creates a new repository in the current directory. git branch Lists all of the branches that are in the current branch. git add . Stages all of the files for commit in the current and subirectories. git add -u Stages all of the previously commited files in the current and subdirectories. git commit -m \"MESSAGE\" Commits the changes made to files, removal of files from the repo, and addition of files to the repo. MESSAGE should be replaced with a details of the changes made since the last commit. git clone REPOURL Makes a copy of the repository from Github to your local computer. This allows for changes to be made from your local computer. REPOURL should be replaced with the URL from the remote repository. git status Shows the current branch, files that have added but not committed, files that have been removed but not committed, files that have not been staged for committing. git rm FILENAME Removes files from the repository. If removing directories, \"-r\" option needs to be used. Replace FILENAME with the name of the actual file. git diff --cached COMMITHASH Shows the changes that have been made between a previous commit and the files pending commitment. If no files have been staged for commit, then this command will not return any output. COMMITHASH should be replaced with the unique identifer of a previous commit. git diff --cached $(git log | head -1 | awk '{print $2}') Performs the same command above, but automatically gets the latest commit from the git log command. This command will only work on Unix or Linux based systems. git diff $(git log | head -1 | awk '{print $2}') $(git log | head -7 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}') Shows the changes between the latest commit and the previous commit by pulling the commit hash from git log command. This command will only work on Unix or Linux based systems. git log Shows the commit history. This include the commit message, date, time, author, and commit ID (or hash). git clean Removes files that are not being tracked. git push origin BRANCH Pushes files from the origin branch to the git server that hosts the repository. BRANCH should be replaced with the name of the branch, although it does not have to be specified. if BRANCH is not entered, then the current branch will be pushed. git pull origin BRANCH Pulls the latest version of the branch from your git server. BRANCH should be replaced with the name of the branch, although it does not have to be specified. git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm Deletes the local files that have already been removed from the git repo. git branch | grep -v master | xargs git branch -D Deletes all of the local branches except master. Useful for when multiple remote branches have been removed and you need to remove the local corresponding branches. Definitions commit A commit is a revision, or set of updates, made to one or more files. fork Makes a copy of repo that is owned by somebody else and allows you to make changes to the code without making changes to the original repo. issue Issues are used to track bugs or enhancements for a project. merge Combines changes from two branches into a single branch. branch A version of code in the repository. Changes to the code are normally done in another branch and then merged into the master branch of the repository. push To send the code from your local machine to the central repository (server). pull To get the latest code from the central repository (server) to your local machine. clone To make a copy of the repository from the central repository (server) to the local machine.","title":"Git Cheatsheet"},{"location":"resources/git-cheatsheet/#git-cheat-sheet","text":"Cheatsheet of commands to use when working with git.

A few modules exist which more or less successfully attempt to get Drupal to display meaningful breadcrumbs on every page. One of these modules is menu_breadcrumb , which displays the breadcrumb trail based on current node's menu path. Very useful and sufficient in most use cases. Limitations and automatic menu modules The only problem with menu_breadcrumb is when you're not happy to grant users the administer menu permission to create and assign menu items for the content they create. Several Drupal modules exist which work around the permission restriction and automatically create menu items for newly created content nodes. To name a few, Auto Menu and Automatic Menu , both of which are either only available for Drupal 5.x, or their Drupal 6.x implementation is still in beta development stage. Rules and Drupal API Fortunately, a quick and easy way to create menu items programmatically doesn't even require a standalone module. All we're going to need is the Rules module and a bit of Drupal API knowledge. The Rules set of modules allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions, such as arbitrary PHP code execution, based on occurring events, such as node creation. For the Drupal API part, we'll use a single function menu_link_save . menu_link_save requires an item configuration parameter, whose key names mirror the column names of Drupal's menu_links database table. The solution As mentioned above, we're going to use the Rules module. It's installation is pretty straightforward and requires no additional configuration. Let's move right to the setting up our rule. Say we want to create a menu item under Primary Links menu's Blog item every time a new node of type Story is created. Navigate your browser to Administer \u00bb Rules \u00bb Triggered rules page, add a new rule and configure it along the lines of the image: Finally, we're getting to the PHP snippet itself, which we'll use to automatically create a new menu item every time this rule is triggered. Click Execute custom PHP code and insert the following fragment of code: $item = array( 'link_path' => 'node/' . $node->nid, 'link_title' => $node->title, 'plid' => 426, 'hidden' => 1 ); menu_link_save($item); Just a few remarks on otherwise pretty simple piece of code. menu_link_save function will only accept normalized path as a link path. When using anything nontrivial for the path, such as the loaded node's path property, always use drupal_get_normal_path() to normalize its value! menu_name is the the machine-readable name of the menu. You can get that from Administer \u00bb Site building \u00bb Menus page as the last component of the menu customization URL. Value of plid is the menu link id of the item you want your item to be a child of. Again, easy to find out, just navigate your browser to the menu's List items page and figure out the menu link id of each menu item from its edit link URL. It's up to you whether you want the menu item hidden or displayed by default. I'm using the automatically created menu items just to give menu_breadcrumb a when putting together the current page's breadcrumb trail. I don't want the menu items to be visible to the users, that's why i set the hidden value to 1.

What is the command: awk 'length($0)>50' datafile.txt Breaking down the command we have: awk This is the program that we are running 'length($0)>50' This is the argument that is passed to the program.","title":"Find Lines Longer than Specified Length"},{"location":"technology/2016.11.19-setup-ssh-on-openwrt/","text":"Setup SSH on OpenWRT This video shows how to set up SSH on OpenWRT version Chaos Calmer.

Transcript (Unedited) All right so tonight we're going to cover building a web application without doing any coding like at all so and just for a little kicks and giggles all right so Who am I i'm kenny robinson I have a bachelors from in business from the university Alabama so I have a minor in computer science my day job is still in production support as an IT consultant and who's doing the automations data analysis process improvements the whole nine yards you can look me up on LinkedIn that is the URL and also have a github account if you go to the hacking I'm not doing my day job I'm doing stuff like this and this is a actual traffic light and the box in my hand is a Raspberry Pi connected with relays that I programmed and this particular scenario I was demonstrating it to kids teaching them how they can use computer science with electrical engineering you know it's possible career paths all right so what is Drupal Drupal is a content management system most people are familiar with WordPress or Drupal Joomla and Drupal is kind of the I won't say the redheaded stepchild kind of the fairy bleep snow it is open source it is created by dries fight art he's also a DC I think he's the chief information officer a company called aqua which drupal functionality outside of the core can be extended by using modules and WordPress people know this as plugins but it's the same concept Drupal is not often used because it is more technically advanced and you have to have more familiarity with it how to use it just more hands-on experience the current versions are version 7 and version 8 version 7 is still popular because of the fact those modules that exist to extend the functionality have to be rewritten for the new framework that is being used in version 8 so a lot of the sites including the one I'm going to use today it's written in Drupal 7 Trippel does have a command-line interface is known as thrush has packages in Ubuntu and maybe a other linux distros there's not one on Windows as far as I know and if you want to look up more about football the website is true filled out over all right so most people think intact I've never used the Drupal website not so fast so there are several websites the white house the FEMA and the Weather Channel all use Drupal behind the scenes The Weather Channel recently did they did a major upgrade probably roughly two to three years ago to switch over to the Drupal platform and as you know whether The Weather Channel does weather everywhere so they have millions of data elements that they are trying to law the track used for historical references pulling data from other places like the National Weather Service and so forth so if you want to read about that you can read up on the case study FEMA also has the Drupal website whoa and what they're still using like apps you know we go out in fields in the disaster areas like Florida for instance for the recent hurricane and this interface you know the Drupal website allows them to interface from their phones in the field and a lot of times if you look at a website you can conative whether it is Google based or not in the White House website there's this meta tag that does say rupal 7 is the generator of the site all right so I use Drupal in my personal setup one of which is farm OS farm OS is a particular truthful distribution and it allows for a YouTube manage is intended for usage with the farm but it's also can be used I use it as for garden and managing like grass and stuff like that so in that particular screenshot actually took a striking the red peppers that I've ever this year and decided to take a photo uploaded into Drupal and also use the data to track how much another use that I have for it is issue tracker so kind of like github has issues I use the same thing but for tracking issues with my house and with my vehicle and one other use you can use is automation you can Drupal has the capabilities of sending and receiving restful quests so for instance if you want let's say is you tracker to connect to my farm of s I can have my issue tracker trigger you know let's say something happen let's say I added an issue with the grass well that issue could be sent to farm OS and it's like well you create an issue over there let me log it over here as well and that allows for across you know automating tasks another thing that I've done is with farm or lest I have it pulling data from the National Weather Service the National Weather Service has an XML feed that is available for each locality so by pulling that data I'm able to use that to determine whether it has rain or not and if it has a range within the last seven days I have farmer les send the email saying there has been no rain you need to water the grass so there's many many uses of them all right now into the demonstration so these are the notes we're going to assume they're not great at coding or do not know how to code you have one business day to do everything with this particular project there are no project plans in advance it has to be a web-based application it has to have a mobile API and it must be browser friendly and you also have to like the ability to log into the website to do have the client to be able to log into their own updates thinking all right so we're gonna do this and it work when I tested it but as I do production support on the daily basis let's hope it still works all right so first things first we're going all right so all of the code that I'm gonna be showing this whole repo is here on github like I say you can link to my page from the hacking jam page as I'm a member on there and all the instructions that we'll be covering are listed here if we run across something that's not quite right I'll go back and correct it afterwards all right so the first thing we'll do is to set up Drupal so I have my dev server set up with the code files already in place so normally you would just go set rupal files put them in place so if your web server so forth alright then we'll do the standard installation and we're choosing English Music it's like we're already calling the fire department there we go okay so normally you have to enter your database credentials and it will prompt you give you a form so the database name the user ID password and the server credentials you would enter those but since I already have a settings.php file in place if you skip that particular part of the process all right the next step is to enter the site name so we'll just call it fast web app for short you have to enter the site email address Drupal has the capabilities of sending emails out all right then you set up your settings obviously we're in the United States time zone if you want update notifications you can put these in place if not you can easily just turn them off and save them continue all right and once loop was done it'll allow you to log into the website all right so with the standard installation you get a lot of additional modules installed that you really don't need so what we're going to do is we're going to turn those off and these steps are also again in the github readme file so we don't need comments dashboard database logging overlay and shortcut all right and then we do need to turn on some additional modules to get honest functionality so we need scrolling down we need see tools this is called see tools for short but it was chaos tools services which will enable the usage of REST API and then we also need the rest server alright and we could continue if you forget to check something Drupal says hey I need this to complete this you just turn it on either way all right so we'll go back to the home page and we're gonna create a new content type well new content when you use the standard into installation it creates the article in the basics page content types for most of if you're just creating static pages you'll use the basic page type and we will say all right so now we have the first page is active and it can be accessed at this URL all right so now that we have one page in place we're going to make this site mobile-friendly so there's a theme here called Mayo and we're gonna enable that and also set it as the default and then we'll go into settings and with Drupal a lot of times the configuration items do not initially save to the database when you set them up so it's always best to go in and save the options even if you don't change them initially all right so this is our mobile friendly thing and if you resize it you see how it kind of puts everything in a single column but if you expanded there's the sidebar that's over here now so we've completed the the mobile browser version of this all right so the next is to go to the structure and we can rearrange the items on the page like if you wanted to search bar to be below the navigation go to structure locks and here are each of the blocks and so there are additional blocks at the bottom that you're not using if you want to move them around life I wanted to get rid of this power by Drupal just move it down to the disable section and if I went to search box below the navigation I can move it there and then hit safe and so now you see the search box is below the navigation and also the Drupal footer is removed right same concept different name alright so now that we've done our page layout we can go and create our REST API so we go to structure again and services and so we're gonna add an endpoint and we're going to name the endpoint now the machine name is the internal name think of it as like the unique identifier for that particular service so we're gonna name it API and machine names have to be lowercase if not if you type the wrong thing again and it will display an error and the server we're going to select is the rest server this is one of the options that we turned on did our module updates so we're not gonna do session authentication that's a little bit more complex for this particular demonstration and so we'll save and now we have our REST API available so we'll go to edit resources and we need to be able to pull content from that REST API so we're going to note is a so in Drupal there's a concept of entities and users are entities pages which we refer to as nodes are also entities and taxonomy which is kind of like keywords or categories also known as entity are types of entities so with the node entity basically basically page is a type of node and they know it is a type of an entity so in order to be able to access the page that we did create we'll need to be able to retrieve a node and if you want to list all of the pages you'll need to turn on the indexing of a node you can create nodes but we won't do that in this demo that's also a little bit more advanced so now that we have our retrieve and index capabilities turned on for our API we will get save all right so the next thing is to test the rest API is Firefox Chrome as an extension not for sure of what it is but I do know that Firefox also has an extension called poster all right and you can take this URL so by default when you do a API request and will return the XML but if you put dot JSON at the end of it you will get a JSON response and so here is our Dixon response that shows the full list since we only have one node is only listing that one node but if there were additional nodes it would show those as well all right and to get only just that particular node you specify the node ID and the node ID can be found by either going to the page and looking at the URL or you if you're looking at a database you'll see it the same way you'll have this unique identifier over one so we just append that to the URL and do a get request and these are all the elements in that the revision ID we have the user ID the title status whether the node is visible to the public or not his commenting turned it on turned on or not is it promoted to the front page and various other elements in here as well so now you have a fully functioning web application that is also mobile friendly and it did not take you eight hours to build it with the rest API so any questions and yes you can have more questions yes it is it's the quick and short version there it is a little bit more elaborate if you want to get more involved as far as like you can with the Bicentennial application that we're building we actually have custom additional content types that we're using and that allows for us to have additional fields so we can go in and put in let's see so we can specify field types these are just the default types but but I'll say you can add additional modules there's an email fill type there's an address field type there's all kinds of additional field types that can be added and it will do validation on that type you know if you make it mandatory what is it this is my sequel but it also supports sequel Lite I think it is yes yes we have some of them available we do have some of them available but we're still working on everything else we have a high level view of everything at this point then we'll tweak it as need be yes trying to get so I'll give you a history of I'll give you a history on that so where I work my our clients we had a system you know the system that does all the access provisioning and so the I guess the root user is called I am admin so I just kind of took it from that alright so here's the historic marker content type and so in here we have the stuff that you would probably think that would be necessary so like what county is it in what city location don't ya picture the ability to put pictures in here as well yes yes and see even even if you don't want to Jason even if you don't want to Jason output also you","title":"Build Web Application without Coding Using Drupal

Currently I build automations using Selenium WebDriver and Sikuli to automate routine daily tasks. Since I maintain multiple websites, I figured that I could use this same technology to perform the code updates on the websites that I manage. Selenium WebDriver has some first time setup steps that have to be done in order for you to be able to build the automations. My browser of choice is Firefox. Some people reading this will not be thrilled about that, but everyone has their preferences. If you like to use Chrome, or worse Internet Explorer, then the steps mentioned below are similar to those for Firefox. However this post focuses on setting up with Firefox. First thing that you will need to do is to have Eclipse or similar IDE installed on your computer. That will not be covered in this post. Next, download the Gecko Driver. That can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver . The Gecko Driver serves as a middle man between WebDriver and the web browser. The web browser cannot directly communicate or interact with the web browser. What happens is WebDriver interacts with the Gecko Driver. Then the Gecko Driver translates those interactions into actions that the browser can perform. Once the action is performed, then response is sent back from the browser to the Gecko Driver to WebDriver. Next, create a Maven project. In the pom.xml file, you will need to add the following dependency to the file: <dependency> <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId> <version>3.14.0</version> </dependency> At the time of this writing, 3.14.0 version, was the second latest versoin that was available. I would recommend using the latest or later version that is available. Next, add the Java code below to your main function. This is the simpliest code to get an automation running with Firefox. System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); // define geckodriver location WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); // open the website of choice Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser ``` In the above, /home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver will need to be replaced with the location that you have downloaded the Gecko Driver. If you choose, you may also change the website that the browser opens. Now you may run the application that you have built. If done correctly, you will see the browser open, then the Google home page appear, then the browser close. There may be some red text in the Java console, but there is no need to be alarmed by this unless there is an exception mentioned. The code used here can be downloaded from my Github repository at https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial The entire file Java file would look like the following: package com.thealmostengineer.seleniumtutorial; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver; /** * Simple webdriver * */ public class App { static void geckoDriverTest() throws Exception { System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser driver.manage().window().maximize(); // maximize the browser window driver.get(\"http://google.com\"); Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen driver.quit(); // close browser } public static void main( String[] args ) { try { geckoDriverTest(); } catch (Exception e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } }","title":"Set up Gecko Driver on Ubuntu"},{"location":"technology/2019.04.05-set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu/#set-up-gecko-driver-on-ubuntu","text":"Selenium WebDriver can be used to automate routine tasks and to perform regression tests.

Drupal does have a module that will do just that. However the process to schedule a post was badly designed in my opinion. That being said, I decided to write my own module that would handle this functionality for me. By writing my own module, I can customize the module how I choose without having additional features that I do not need. In case you are wondering whether this works or not, I am using the code below to publish the blog posts on this website. First you'll need to create a content type if you don't already have one. With Drupal 7, go to Structure > Content Types to create a new content type. When creating the content type, take note to the Machine Name that is associated with your content type. You'll need this later. Next let's take a look at the code: function almostengr_publish_posts() { $result = db_query(\"select nid from {node} where created &lt;= :datetime and promote = :promote and status = :status and type = :type\", array(\":datetime\" =&gt; REQUEST_TIME, \":promote\" =&gt; 1, \":status\" =&gt; 0, \":type\" =&gt; \"article\")); foreach($result as $row) { $article = node_load($row-&gt;nid); $article-&gt;status = 1; // update the status $article-&gt;comment = 2; // enable comments node_save($article); // save article } // end foreach } // end function The code above queries the node table for the node IDs that have a created date before the current date and time, are selected to be promoted to the front page, are not published, and have a type of article. Then each node that matches the queried condition, will be loaded, have the node status updated to published and the comments enabled, and then saved. Next need to create a cron process that will handle this further. We will do this in code too. function almostengr_cron() { almostengr_publish_posts(); } // end function With the code above, we are using cron to call the publish posts function. The cron function within the module that you create will be automatically called via the Drupal hook_cron functionality. Now to the creating of content. When you create a new node, you need to do the following for it to be scheduled to be published: Set the Created Date to the date and time that you wish the article to be published Promoted to Front Page selected Published status is not selected Save the content That's it.

Sometimes having an app does help you out to be more productive. Other times, it is a waste of space and a way for the company to spy on you and your activities so that they can target you with ads. That being said, here are seven reasons why I am hesitant to install new apps. Reason One: Mobile Friendly Website It is no secret that majority of the online traffic today comes from some sort of mobile device. As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websites identified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders. Which brings me to my next reason... Reason Two: Less Notifications Today's society is constantly connected. Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level. Reason Three: Phone Space Apps take up space. Some take up more than others. At last check, the Facebook app is over 150MB. Compare that to other apps, and that is a large application. To add to that, apps store data on your phone. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will cache some of the data on your phone that they have downloaded in the background. Over time, this cached data, if not removed, will slow down your phone and reduce your battery life. Meanwhile, I could be using that phone space to store videos, photos, music, audio books... you get the idea. Reason Four: It May Be Old, But It Still Works When you do not rely on the app to be able to interact with a website or service, you can use an older phone. Periodically, Android raises the minimum version that apps have to comply with. Some app developers, mandate that you have an operating system that is no more than 3 versions behind the latest stable version available. About a year ago, I encountered this with the Southwest app. I have Android Lollipop on my phone. In an update, Southwest made the minimum version to Android Marshmallow, thus not allowing me to have the app on my phone. Southwest mobile website does everything that the app does, including displaying my boarding pass, so I started using that and uninstalled the app. Yes\u2026 I know that I could have went and got a new phone so that I could have continued to use the app. No\u2026 I could not justify the cost of getting a new phone for convenience of being able to check-in on a flight about 2 to 3 times per year. Besides if I had issues with the mobile website, Southwest lets you print boarding passes for free. Reason Five: IOS Versus Android Appearance and Features If you are an Android person asking an iPhone user how to do something in an app, there is a 50/50 chance that the directions given will not work. Same goes for the other way around. Why is that? Well iPhone apps have to follow Apple standards in order to be listed in the App Store. Android apps do not have similar standards. In addition, some apps are built upon the features that are native to that operating system. Therefore, if one system interprets \"and\" as \"&\" and the other interprets it as \"+\", then you will get two different outcomes for the same thing. This problem is not as big now as it was in the past thanks to programming languages such as Xamarin, which allow for code to be written once and be compatible for iOS and Android platforms. Reason Six: Information Apps Are A Waste In the past, I've done consultations for small businesses and startups and they claim that one of main things that they want to do as part of getting their business off the ground is to create an app. Some do have their preferences about getting aniOS app built before the Android app and vice versa, but that is not the point of this reason. When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this: KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do? CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services. KENNY: Anything else beyond that? CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app. KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app created is x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars. CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find. Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download an app because they want information about your business. That is what your website is for. People download apps because they want additional features that are not available via your website or to enhance the functionality of their phone. For instance, some people, myself included, have multiple email accounts. I would not download an email app that only supported one email account. While it is true that I could have all of my email forwarded to a single account, I have multiple accounts because each account has a designated purpose. I do not want my \"daily coupon and specials\" emails be merged in with my \"new billing statement available\" emails. Reason Seven: The App Is A Fancy Web Browser Try this... go to your app and take a note of its appearance. Then go to the website (or mobile website) that is associated with that app. If the app and the mobile website look the same, there is a 99.999999994% (yes that last 4 is significant) chance that the app that you have is just a web browser that only allows you to access that company's website. That's right... there are companies that are building mobile friendly websites and then building apps that only navigate to that mobile friendly website. I am not going to mention their names, but some financial institutions that I have done business with have done this in the past. In addition, I did some contract work for a service provider. That service provider was charging about $1,000 for the mobile app. All they were doing were changing the default URL in the app, installing a WordPress plugin so that the page would render as being mobile friendly, and publishing it to the App or Play Store. All of that took about a 1 hour to complete. Conclusion While these strategies may not work for you, I find my phone to be less of a maintenance annoyance and pain point for keeping updated since I am using fewer apps. It is true that \"There's an app for that\". With that in mind, I challenge you to think of whether you really need that app before installing it.","title":"7 Reasons I Can Do That Without The App"},{"location":"technology/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app","text":"These days, everybody wants you to download their app. However, before installing an app, I ask myself whether I really do need the app. Every company's answer to this is \"Yes with sprinkles on the side\".

As part of setting up AdSense on The Almost Engineer website, I had the liberty of reading through and researching some of the requirements in order to get ranked on Google. Websites identified by the Google Search Crawleras being mobile-friendly, are given higher ranking than those that do not. This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result. With this change, that means the features that are available on the website from my computer should also be available and work on my mobile device. I have not had the Facebook app installed on my phone for over 3 years. Those of you that use Facebook are probably wondering how that is possible. It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website.

Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level.","title":"Reason Two: Less Notifications"},{"location":"technology/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-three-phone-space","text":"Apps take up space.

The thing about writing code is that at some point, maintenance has to be done on the code to keep it up to date and to add future enhancements and functionality. What Kind of Pest (The Problem) Squirrels and rats both chew on wood. However they do not eat the same stuff, so you have to be selective with the bait that you choose. For most of the automations that I build, I use Selenium WebDriver as the automations are for web-based applications. Recently, we have noticed that number of automations have not been running due to \u201cconnection refused\u201d exceptions. The connection is being refused from the automation jar not connecting to the Gecko Driver (the interface between WebDriver automation and the browser). Applying knowledge that I have of computers, normally you only see \u201cconnection refused\u201d messages when one or more of the scenarios occur too many devices trying to connect at the same time, also referred to as Denial of Service Attack or Distributed Denial of Service Attack a firewall is rejecting the connection wrong password when trying to authenticate. Tracking Down The Pest (The Analysis) I was able to immediately rule out scenarios 2 and 3 because the automation would work majority of the time. In other words, we know it is not a rat based on the evidence. Therefore, through the process of elimination, it must be a squirrel. Majority being that out of 7 days of the week that it was used, it would fail only on 1 of those days. I then did some research on the internet that provided a number of causes and solutions for the exception occurring. Some of the causes included the Gecko Driver process not being able to write to a log file because existing log file already exists (not in our case) having concurrent WebDriver automations running at the same time (which wasn\u2019t our case as we have done several at the same time in the past) to the hosts file not having the localhost IP address entered (which we did not, but nslookup and ping commands both returned valid IP addresses) having bad code. I got to that last reason in the list, bad code, and I put more effort into looking into the code as we have experienced (2+ years) and inexperienced developers on our team. Found The Nest (Found The Source Of The Problem) After search through multiple automation projects, shaking my head at some of the exact examples of bad code mentioned in Robert Martin\u2019s Clean Code , I hit the bullseye. Several of the automations had the same code. Yes\u2026 copied and pasted. First person got it working, so the next person got theirs working by doing exactly what the first person did. There's that saying about if you see one bug, there's probably another one not too far way. This would be it. To make it worse, it was multiplying everytime the code was copy and pasted. This is what I found: WebDriver driver = null; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here driver.quit(); System.exit(0); } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); System.exit(1); } Now this is just a snippet of the actual code. Obviously, I cannot put the entire code here because of confidentiality. Do you notice the problem with this code? The problem here is that if an exception occurs between the try and driver.quit(); , the browser and as a result, the Gecko Driver process never exits. What happens when you have too many processes running? The system will hang. What happens when there are too many connections open to a process? Some of those connections are refused. Spraying The Bug Spray (The Solution) To now rid the varmint of our code, I had to fix the defect that I identified. The driver.quit(); should always be executed regardless of whether the exception occurs. The reason being is that you do not want to the browser nor the Gecko Driver process running as they will hang up your system or result in the \"connection refused\" exceptions. So I changed the above code to the code below: WebDriver driver = null; int exitCode = 1; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here exitCode = 0; } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); } driver.quit(); System.exit(exitCode); The changes that I made: the driver.quit(); has been moved outside of the try-catch block. That way it will always execute whether an exception occurs or not. Could a finally block been used? Yes. However, for the sake of simplifying the code I did not use one. I moved the System.exit call to the end of the code. It is best to have only one way to exit a function. If you have multiple ways to exit (or return) out of a function, code that needs to exit may not get executed because of the multiple ways out. I created a new integer variable called exitCode . Following standards for program exit code, 1 or greater means that something went wrong during execution. 0 means that everything went well during execution. Therefore, the variable defaults to 1 because you do not want your code to say that all went well when it actually did not. It is better to have a false failure and it get noticed than to have a false success and it go undetected. Conclusion If you are going to copy the code of others, please be sure to review it first before using it as it may have defects already in it. If you do not know what the code does, then spend a few moments searching for those commands or snippets online so that you learn what they do. Using code somebody else wrote without confirming that it is not defective, is like building a chair from wood and not checking to see if it is rotting or has termites. \"Rotting.\" by AisforAmy91 is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0","title":"Copying Infested Code"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#copying-infested-code","text":"","title":"Copying Infested Code"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#background","text":"As some of you may know, my current role consists of me building and maintaining automations.

Applying knowledge that I have of computers, normally you only see \u201cconnection refused\u201d messages when one or more of the scenarios occur too many devices trying to connect at the same time, also referred to as Denial of Service Attack or Distributed Denial of Service Attack a firewall is rejecting the connection wrong password when trying to authenticate.","title":"What Kind of Pest (The Problem)"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#tracking-down-the-pest-the-analysis","text":"I was able to immediately rule out scenarios 2 and 3 because the automation would work majority of the time. In other words, we know it is not a rat based on the evidence. Therefore, through the process of elimination, it must be a squirrel. Majority being that out of 7 days of the week that it was used, it would fail only on 1 of those days. I then did some research on the internet that provided a number of causes and solutions for the exception occurring. Some of the causes included the Gecko Driver process not being able to write to a log file because existing log file already exists (not in our case) having concurrent WebDriver automations running at the same time (which wasn\u2019t our case as we have done several at the same time in the past) to the hosts file not having the localhost IP address entered (which we did not, but nslookup and ping commands both returned valid IP addresses) having bad code. I got to that last reason in the list, bad code, and I put more effort into looking into the code as we have experienced (2+ years) and inexperienced developers on our team.","title":"Tracking Down The Pest (The Analysis)"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#found-the-nest-found-the-source-of-the-problem","text":"After search through multiple automation projects, shaking my head at some of the exact examples of bad code mentioned in Robert Martin\u2019s Clean Code , I hit the bullseye. Several of the automations had the same code. Yes\u2026 copied and pasted. First person got it working, so the next person got theirs working by doing exactly what the first person did. There's that saying about if you see one bug, there's probably another one not too far way. This would be it. To make it worse, it was multiplying everytime the code was copy and pasted. This is what I found: WebDriver driver = null; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here driver.quit(); System.exit(0); } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); System.exit(1); } Now this is just a snippet of the actual code. Obviously, I cannot put the entire code here because of confidentiality. Do you notice the problem with this code? The problem here is that if an exception occurs between the try and driver.quit(); , the browser and as a result, the Gecko Driver process never exits. What happens when you have too many processes running? The system will hang. What happens when there are too many connections open to a process? Some of those connections are refused.","title":"Found The Nest (Found The Source Of The Problem)"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#spraying-the-bug-spray-the-solution","text":"To now rid the varmint of our code, I had to fix the defect that I identified. The driver.quit(); should always be executed regardless of whether the exception occurs. The reason being is that you do not want to the browser nor the Gecko Driver process running as they will hang up your system or result in the \"connection refused\" exceptions. So I changed the above code to the code below: WebDriver driver = null; int exitCode = 1; try{ driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get(\"http://thealmostengineer.com\"); // other WebDriver steps go here exitCode = 0; } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); } driver.quit(); System.exit(exitCode); The changes that I made: the driver.quit(); has been moved outside of the try-catch block. That way it will always execute whether an exception occurs or not. Could a finally block been used? Yes. However, for the sake of simplifying the code I did not use one. I moved the System.exit call to the end of the code. It is best to have only one way to exit a function. If you have multiple ways to exit (or return) out of a function, code that needs to exit may not get executed because of the multiple ways out. I created a new integer variable called exitCode . Following standards for program exit code, 1 or greater means that something went wrong during execution. 0 means that everything went well during execution. Therefore, the variable defaults to 1 because you do not want your code to say that all went well when it actually did not. It is better to have a false failure and it get noticed than to have a false success and it go undetected.","title":"Spraying The Bug Spray (The Solution)"},{"location":"technology/2019.09.05-copying-infested-code/#conclusion","text":"If you are going to copy the code of others, please be sure to review it first before using it as it may have defects already in it.

Video Transcript (Unedited) what's going on YouTube family so in this video I'm gonna actually to set up the automatic updates using unattended upgrades on Ubuntu 18.04 so let's get to it thanks for checking out the almost engineer channel if you are visiting for the first time please be sure to subscribe by clicking subscribe button below so automatic updates is a feature available in Ubuntu similar to Windows has Windows updates where it basically up stations the system automatically with little to no effort on your part and so the default setup for automatic updates is that it only updates these security packages however I actually wanted to get it to update everything on the system and so what I'm gonna do is actually run through a number of steps and these steps are available on my website as well as the Ubuntu - Help section of the Ubuntu - website on how to configure some of this so the first thing you'll need to do is to run sudo apt-get install unattended upgrades and I already have that installed it's pretty common I think it's installed by default when you install Ubuntu 18.04 so if you don't have it just run the install command it won't hurt if you already have it it'll tell you you already have it alright so the next thing you go to CD Etsy apt apt Kampf daddy alright and then in this directory there are two files that we're going to edit so the first one is going to be the 50 unattended upgrades and then the next one is going to be the 20 auto upgrades so you're gonna need to sudo for this so 50 unattended upgrades looks like I have a whole backup file I'll probably come back and remove that point so alright do VI and as you see here so there are comments in this file and so basically by defaults like I mentioned it will only install security updates but I want to actually install like general updates as well so I'm going to remove the double slashes here and then do WQ actually gonna go out and open nano you can still do this in VI but nano I'm more familiar with the shortcuts for nano so alright so we've removed the comments for the just standard updates I don't want the proposed or backports consultant unnecessarily stable updates so you only want the stuff that's actually stable so going down if you there are packages that you want to exclude you can uncomment these usually I would leave these as are as they are because you never know when update may happen for those you want the latest version the next option mentions whether you want the development release of Ubuntu to be automated oh great I'm going to leave that at false I want to make sure that I have the latest stable version not the development version so again I'm leaving that one at false all right the next option says that it allows you to control if on an unclean dpkg exit understand the upgrades will automatically run the default is true to ensure that your updates keep getting installed so I will leave that at true so I'll relieve this since this mine is coming it I'll leave that as is alright split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that they can be interrupted with sig term this makes the upgrade a bit slower it has to benefit that shut down while the upgrade is running is possible I'm gonna leave that at false again it's not necessarily but if you need to have that done you can uncomment this and go forward the next option install all unintended upgrades when the machine is shutting down instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running this will obviously make shutdown slower I'm going to leave that commented because I don't when I shut down a system I wanted to go ahead and shut down I don't want it to continue to go ahead and try to install the updates while shutting down all right the next option is to send the email to this address for problems or packages upgrade so basically if there's a problem you'll get an email which also means you also need to have a mail server setup and so since I do development on this particular machine I don't want to setup a mail server to prevent some of those development actions from sending out emails because sometimes you know when you're developing you build our email functionality and the last thing you want is to have a email going out to a actual human user you know in your development face all right so removed used kernels you'll want to let's see I want to uncomment this one and the reason I'm I'm coming this one is uncomment and gonna set this to true and the reason I'm doing that is because of the fact I want the kernel packages removed if you don't remove kernel packages what will happen over time is that the disk space will eventually started getting used up significantly because kernel packages are relatively big on a Linux system and so I went through one day and I actually had about 15 or 20 gigs of packages just sitting that were no longer the latest version so it's like if it's not the latest version why do I still have it and so I removed it so this will handle that automatically so you don't have to manually do it alright the next one do automatic removal of new unused dependency after the upgrade so which is the equivalent of running app get out of remove I do want that and I'm going to uncomment it and then also set it to the true automatically reboot without confirmation and so basically if it finds the reboot file then you wanted to reboot I am leave that one set at false well actually I take that back I'm actually changed this to true because the system does need to reboot I wanted to go ahead and reboot to apply those changes and then the next option I wanted to reboot to am is pretty decent for my particular situation you know at 2:00 a.m. I'm usually not doing anything there may be a chance where a automation of some sort is running in the background not on this particular machine but just in general so this should be sufficient in my opinion all right if you want to set a bandwidth limit you can uncheck this setting frankly I do not care about the bandwidth limit so I believe that as is if you want logging you can set that up I'm gonna leave it as false same thing for the syslog facility download operates only on AC power this particular machine only runs off of AC power there is no battery connected to it so no sense of setting it up because it will always need to be run and then last option is to download and install it grace only on non meter connections I believe that one commented if you're using like a Wi-Fi hotspot or something of that similar nature you'll want to consider enabling this option that way you're not installing you know updates in using all of your allocated bandwidth all right so I'm going to save that file now and the next file I will need to look at is also in the same directory it is the 2002 upgrades so open nano again if you want to use VI you can use VI but I'm using nano alright and so per the documentation on the Ubuntu website it mentions that there are a number of options that we can add in here and so update package lists that the one is already added and recommended to be done also the same thing for the unattended upgrade value set to one alright so the additional options are to add apt periodic and then Auto clean interval and set that a value to seven and so what this will do is it will clean up old download archives every week so again that's about the maintaining the space on the file system keeping it clean and then download upgradable packages is the other option that it mentions that is advisable to be included so you do a periodic download - upgradable packages and set that by you equal to one with a semicolon and then that is it for that one alright oops save then exit alright so once you have done that if you are using like version control for your SC directory you'll want to commit those changes so I'm going to go ahead and do that now at - ooh sudo get status just to confirm that those are added and sudo get commit and then we're going to do updated the unattended upgrade settings actually I need to change that to updated so go back alright and then for safekeeping I need to push that up alright so my commit has been pushed up so that this configuration change has now been saved and if something happens to this system in the future all I have to do is pull that configuration back down and it is good to go so hopefully this video has helped you in configuring your unattended upgrade set up on your Ubuntu to 18.04 machine if you have any questions

However, like any piece of software, it has to be regularly worked on in order to stay up to date. Thus I looked into switching over to a static website. Static websites are now starting to make a comeback. As you may know, the early dates of websites were mostly comprised of static websites. Over time, then need for information to be delivered faster, items to be purchased online, and individuals wanting to have their own online space, resulted in more dynamic tools being created. Here are the pros and cons that I discovered when researching to switch to a static website. The Pros No Database A static website does not have a need for a database. When you have less infrastructure to maintain, you are free to do other things. With Drupal, if your database goes down, becomes corrupt, or gets hacked, your website will have reduced or no functionality. In addition, you have to keep regular backups of your database in case something does happen to it. I had one of the Drupal websites that I maintain get hacked once. It took a lot of effort to clean up the database after the successful hacking attempt. In addition, the most recent backup, was approximately 6 months or more old. So the changes had taken place since then, which were not tracked, would have been lost and probably not restored. Drupal Security Updates Drupal releases security and feature updates regularly. When the updates are released, they are included in the weekly email newsletter that goes out. In one occurrence, the weekly newsletter went out and a Drupal-based website was exploited within hours based on the details that were provided in the newsletter. This means you have to be immediately ready to download, test, and deploy the latest security patches. Otherwise you are putting your website at risk. I'm only one person and not always have time to make an update as soon as it comes out. For me, performing these code updates are not difficult. However, performing those updates does take time. Time away from writing content, sleep, or doing something more useful with your time. Speed Counts A static website will always be faster than a website that uses a database. The way that Drupal is setup, the database would been called each time a page was accessed. From there, the database would returned a cached version of the page. Load times is one of the factors that Google takes into account when it comes to search ranking. So the faster your page loads, the higher your ranking on search engines. Harder To Hack Content Management Systems usually have a way to login to them. This \"doorway\" for login allows hackers or similar users to gain access to your website and make changes. Static websites do not have login or authentication system. Now I know what you're saying... you can hack the webhost directly. Yes that is true, but you have the know the name of the webhost server. Most of the time, the website does not have the name as the web server, thus making it more difficult to access and hack. The Cons You Have to Rebuild the Entire Website One downside to using Mkdocs, is that when you make one change, you have to rebuild the entire website. There's no way, that I am aware of, that will allow you to update and deploy a single page. This is one of the common complaints that I have read about Mkdocs and other static site generators. At the time, it is not a big deal for me to use a static site generator as I do not have a lot of content. I did read that one website had over 1,500 posts and that it took two hours to generate the entire website using Jekyll. Limited Themes I looked for themes to use that were similar to my current website. Let's just say that there was not many. After doing several searches and finding other blogs that used Mkdocs, I found and chose the Material theme for my blog. It allows you to do some appearance customizations without having to do significant code changes to the theme. Conclusion Hopefully this provides you with insight on whether you should consider changing your website over to a static website.

Most of the time, the website does not have the name as the web server, thus making it more difficult to access and hack.","title":"Harder To Hack"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#the-cons","text":"","title":"The Cons"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/#you-have-to-rebuild-the-entire-website","text":"One downside to using Mkdocs, is that when you make one change, you have to rebuild the entire website.

The conversion that I did for my website, took about 30-40 hours. That was a combination of a few evenings after work and a full weekend. To give you a perspective, I only had about 120 nodes on my Drupal site that had to be converted. Some of the more recent nodes, were already in Markdown format, so only formatting and presentation changes needed to be made. The other nodes were in various formats, including plain text and HTML (filter and full). Do The Setup In order to create a website with MkDocs, you will need to do some initial setup . I did my updates on Ubuntu. Therefore I was able to run sudo apt-get install mkdocs and the rest was done auto-magically. Setup is similar for Mac users. Windows users, you\u2019ll need to install Python and then the MkDocs pip package. Instructions on how to do this are available on the MkDocs website . Stop Creating Content Similar to how difficult it is to drain a bath tub if the water is still running, you will need to stop creating content until you do your migration. Otherwise, you will never complete the conversion process. I will admit, I did write two new posts while going through the conversion process. One about switching to Markdown and MkDocs and the other about raking leaves . Those posts, were written in new site that I was actively working on and not deployed to the old site since it was on the way to the digital landfill. Backup and Export The Database Before you start messing with your content, make a backup of the database and your website code and put it on a system that you will not be working on. That way if you do something wrong (yes it happened several times), then you have something that you can redo your changes from. I copied the production database of my website, as well as the master branch of code to my development server. Then I performed all of the updates in my development environment. I did it this way because that allows my website to continue to remain active. Also, in the worse case of making mistakes, which did happen, those mistakes were not seen by end users as only I have access to my development server. Convert Tables to Markdown Next was to get the posts and other website content into Markdown format. As previously mentioned, some of the content was written in HTML or plain text formats. What I chose to do was to write some database queries that would format the existing data into or close to the format that I wanted the markdown file to be in. The final output was contained in a column in a temporary table that I was using to make the necessary changes ad adjustments. The queries that I used to make this update are in the SQL file located at https://github.com/almostengr/almostengrwebsite/tree/master/migration_scripts . Using a number of update statements, I was able to convert the HTML syntax to Markdown. Some of the tags were too complex to convert, so I left those in the database and fixed them after I did the export to a text file. Export the Markdown Next, I did an export of the data to a CSV file. Now I only exported the column that had the finalized output and the title of each post. I did this using PHPMyAdmin as I have a MySQL database installed. Be sure to select the option that removes the carriage returns and line breaks from the export. After that, I assembled a command that would read each line in the CSV file, take the first column of the CSV file and put it into the body of the Markdown file and take the second column of the CSV file and use it to name the CSV file. This was done through the use of a while loop and the awk command. Take a look at csv_to_individual_files.sh script in the migration_scripts directory. After that, I did the file cleanup. The file clean up removed the additional characters that were present from the CSV file as well as converted the line breaks (<br /> tags) to new line characters. This way the final file will will not be one long line. Copy Images and Supporting Files Next, I copied the images that were used on my Drupal site into an images directory. I put all of the images into a single directory. Then I had to update the Markdown files to use relative paths to these files. Now you can use absolute references to the files, but that may cause you to miss errors when you are developing new content as you will need to use production URLs when setting up the links. If you do not have the image in production when creating new content, you will get no image or the alternate text for that image. Structure and Configure Your Website Blog Categories How you structure your website can make a big difference when it comes to SEO and user experience. When I used Drupal, all I had to do was select the appropriate taxonomy category and the URL part was handled. With the Markdown site, I\u2019m having to do the structure manually. I found it best to place each post in a folder based upon the category that it was intended for. In addition, I named each file with the date that I created the article and the title of the article. By having this information in the URL, it better helps the search engines index my blog. My folders tree looks similar to the following: docs | index.md | 2018 | 2018.02.13-use-twitter-and-rules-for-farmos-notifications/ | 2018.01.23-raspitraffic-demo,-us-signaling/ | 2018.01.16-raspberry-pi-first-run-and-installing-updates/ | 2019 | 2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.20-blog-reverse-sort-with-mkdocs/ | 2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps Sort by Date One of the downfalls to using Markdown, is that it sorts by alphabetical and numeric order. Meaning that my oldest posts would show up first. Nobody wants to have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the latest post that you wrote. What I needed up having to do was to leverage the find , sort , and sed commands to list the files in reverse order. Once I got them in the most recent post first order, I put them into the MkDocs configuration file (mkdocs.yml). After they were in the configuration file, then I added group headings based on the categories. The code that I used for this is available in the sort_by_latest_post.sh file in the migration_scripts directory. Proofread, Proofread, Proofread I went through each of the posts and attempted to correct as many of the formatting and Markdown errors that I could. Some of the errors, I realized were due to a lack of formatting that was done during the database step. So I truncated the temporary table and updated the update database query so that the additional formatting changes could be applied there instead of having to use sed or some other command via the terminal. Some of the HTML formatting I could not remove because of some of the difficulties of trying to match some particular text. So I left it in place for it to be manually modified. As I mentioned earlier, I only had about 120 pages that I had to go through and correct. If you have a blog with thousands or more posts, you may want to have a team help you or build more queries that will make the necessary code updates before deploying. Deploy To Production Not Exactly Perfect Once I was satisfied, I deployed it to production. There are some articles that do not have images contained in them because the image link is incorrect. There are other images that are way too large for the post, and I will need to resize them to make them more appropriate. I will do that at a later date. I deployed my updated site by using the mkdocs gh-deploy command. This creates a separate branch on your repo to deploy to. Then it will generate the static files for your website and push those files to the gh-pages branch. Set up Automated Pull or CI I added a cron job on my production instance that will periodically pull the latest version of the gh-pages to the production server. This will eliminate my need to login to the production instance unless there is a critical failure with the script or something else goes wrong. If you are not able to do a cron job, you can also use a CI server that will do the production deployment for you. Travis is one that is popular to use with Github. Conclusion I am happy with the new setup. The biggest advantage is that I do not have to spend time performing module updates or backups of the Drupal database. Further more, the simplicity of writing blog posts much better as I do not need specialized tools to complete the task.","title":"Blog Conversion Steps"},{"location":"technology/2019.12.24-blog-conversion-steps/#blog-conversion-steps","text":"If you read my previous post , you found out why I chose to migrate away from a CMS (Content Management System).

When I explained the type of work that I did, I often related it to calling customer service when your internet or electricity goes out and you call to report them problem. I was a Level 2 agent for 5 years and then Level 1.5 agent for 2 years (L1.5 is a role they made up to keep providing services for the client). During this time period, I learned a lot as well as demonstrated skills that others had not seen before. Hopefully my experiences that I share, help you be successful in your role. 1) Clients Equate A Burning Match to Wildfire I worked several issues that required to have the client involved in fixing the issue or the issue was reported by the client. In some of those situations, when the client was asked when the issue needed to be resolved by, he or she would say that it needed to be resolved by the end of the day. Mind you, it would be like 3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself, wanted to stay at work later than necessary. In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that was next to a dry wooded wilderness (meaning it was not serious at the moment but had the potential to be). If the deadline that was given to you seems unrealistic to accomplish, ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the right questions, there is a change that, you will have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want, or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a. Murphy's Law) happening. 2) Work Your Hours and Leave If you do not have an on call rotation for your job, you may skip this section. During my entire time in this role, I had to be on call. There was a primary on call rotation, but they were responsible for the initial triage of tickets that were sent to our group. It was never stated, but everyone was on call all the time for the respective applications that he or she supported. Initially I would sometimes work additional hours in addition to the time being on call. After experiencing some burnout of working 50 and 60+ hour weeks, that changed quickly. My perspective became that I would work the required 40 hours per week and on call as scheduled, but that was it. While some issues were quick to fix, other issues would take days to fix because of their complexity or effort required. Because of these reasons and more, I worked the minimum amount of hours, as you never know when that major production issue will come in. If it comes in and you already have 50+ hours clocked for the week, you will experience burnout and make more mistakes due to fatigue and lack of sleep. Example There was two week span that several major issues occurred for the applications that I was the primary and secondary support for. I had to step up and work both, as the primary for the application that I was the secondary support for, was on vacation. Somewhere during that second week, I made a mistake in resolving one of the issues, which resulted in more work having to be done. My manager had to explain this mistake to the client manager and the client manager asked why I was making these kind of mistakes given that it was not the first time that I had worked on this type of issue and that I was experienced with the clients' systems. My manager relayed this question to me and I did not know why. It occurred to me in hindsight that it was exhaustion from the additional hours having to be worked and doing double the work that I would normally do. Example Had a production issue come in for one of my applications while I was working my normal hours for the day. This issue required manually rolling back the data that had been loaded due to bad formatting of the data file. There were some time constraints also, because there was a monthly process that ran related to the client billing their clients. It had to be done and I was the one that had to do it. In total, I spent over 20+ hours being awake and worked at least a good 16 hours on this single issue. I was glad when the issue was resolved and received no push back on requesting the day off on short notice. 3) Documentation One thing that I have learned is that documentation is an essential part of working in production support and help desk environments. If someone cannot understand what is written, then it does not have any use. If You Can't Explain It To A Six Year Old Einstein has been claimed to have said that \"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself\". One of the managers had a similar phrase about if a random person off the street cannot do the steps in the document correctly, then the document was not well written. I agree with both of these statements. The last thing that you want to do is be contacted to resolve an issue that you already wrote documentation for it being misunderstood. If you write a document, and you are the only one that understands what is being done in the document and how to properly perform the steps in the document, that document needs to be redone. Screenshots When I first started writing documentation for our Level 1 support group, I would just write the steps or commands to be executed. After a few mishaps with the Level 1 Support team performing steps, I started to include a screenshot of each step being performed. Did this help reduce the number of errors? Yes it did. In some cases, certain tickets never got escalated to me because the document covered all scenarios and was through. If the command was copied and pasted incorrectly (usually due to the documentation website adding special characters or copying text from a Word document and pasting it directly into a Unix or Linux session) or they did not see the button on the screen that they were to click, they could use the screenshot to verify what it should look like on the screen before reporting it as bad documentation. Good clear instructions with screenshots of the step to perform will reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the human errors that occur with resolving tickets. Find and RTFM (Read The Freaking Manual) Larger vendors provide a manual or some kind of documentation for their products. At one point during my career, the client did a major upgrade of Autosys. It was a significant upgrade as they were going from Autosys 4 to Autosys 11. That big of an upgrade meant that there was limited backwards capabilities. From what I understand, no or limited documentation was provided to the development teams and little training was provided to the support teams. I took it upon myself to find the documentation for the new version that was being upgraded to, as I looking to making adjustments to some jobs that were already in place. Over time, the conversion from one version to the next did cause some production issues. By having the latest Autosys manual document provided by the vendor, I was able to help resolve some of the issues that occurred with the transition. In addition, I was asked to share it with the developers and other support teams because they wanted to see what was different and to be able to get more out of the new system. 4) How to Automate If an issue is recurring and can be automated, then I would suggest that you automate it. Some people freak-out at the thought of automating things because they feel that if you automate enough, you will automate yourself out of a job. From my experience, that was far from the truth. Automating helped reduce the amount of hours that I worked outside of normal business hours. Writing Code You need to know how to write code. Even if you are not great at it, being able to automate mundane, repetitive tasks will save you lots of time over the duration of your career. From writing code from scratch, to pasting bits and pieces of code from Stack overflow and other websites, you can improve your efficiencies and productivity by automating. If you do not know how to code, you can learn how to do so in your free time. What language should you learn? That depends on what languages or systems that you client uses. As mentioned earlier, mine used Linux, Oracle, and other systems, so I became proficient in writing Shell Scripts and using SQL Plus, just to name a couple. Example After a realignment of the team, I became the primary support for a new set of applications. One of those applications had a process that ran on the last three days of the month and the first of the month. Part of that process was that it wrote the date of the first of the month to that file. Problem was that when the process ran on the first of the month, the date was supposed to be for the previous month. For instance, if it was the end of October or the first of November, then we had to make sure that the date in the file was for the first of October. Come to find out, this was a bug that the development team had made a change to, but regression testing was not performed on it. The development team did not consider it urgent as there was a work around available and the business team had back log items that had to be completed by a particular deadline. What was being done by the agent that previously supported the application is that he was getting up in the early hours of the morning, around 1 AM, to manually update the date in the file and start the process. Once I took over the application, I had to start doing the same. What I would do is work my normal shift and then stay up until 1 AM to make the update and start the process as I did not want to sleep through the alarm as this process not running would have a major business impact. After about the third month, I had had enough of doing that and looked into automating it. What the previous agent and myself came up with was a shell script that would run at 1 AM, check the current date, and based on a number of if conditions, write the appropriate date to the file. After a confirmation run of the fix, this fix was presented to the development team. As a result, the development team added it to the code base. Also I did not have to stay up late nights on the first of the month just to edit a text file. 5) Jump the Firewall In some companies, the technology used is so specific to and designed just for that organization, that there are no resources outside of the company that can help resolve or diagnose issues. This is a difficult for individuals that provide support for these components. Other companies do use more name brand technology products, like Oracle, Java, or Linux. There is plenty of documentation on how to use these products and what the error message or exception messages mean and resolution steps. Keep the Privates, Private Going outside of the firewall was frowned upon in some situations as you could risk putting NPI (Non Public Information) or company secrets into the public. I am not suggesting that you ever submit private data or company secrets on a form on the public internet as you do not know where that information will end up. Errors and How To Do I am saying that you can look up an error message to find the answer to a problem that you are having to quickly resolve issues. As I mentioned earlier, the less issues that you have to deal with, the more time that you have to work on other things. This applies to non production issues and items. 6) Share What You Know There is a common notion that if you share what you know, then somebody else can do what you know how to do and then you will be out of a job. While in some industries, that may be true, from my experience it is false. My experience has been that if you know, that allows others to do what you do and allows you to do more and new things. When I worked on tickets that came in, I was sure to include SQL queries, SSH session logs, application logs, and any other information that I used to resolve an issue. Why? Because the last thing I want to have happen, is to get called for an issue when I am on vacation or to have the on-call person call me to resolve an issue that's simple as restarting a process. In some situations, the on-call person was able to resolve the current occurrence of an issue, based on the previous occurrence of an issue that had my notes and other information attached. Example One of the applications (App A) that I supported, was upgraded and set up on a new virtual machine (Server A). As part of the new VM setup, it also got a new IP address. The old server (Server B) was powered down. An interfacing system (App B) was not able to connect to App A. The individual that was the support contact for App B, said that he could not connect to App A from his computer or App B server. I checked the server for App A, and App A was online and running as it should be. After discussing the issue, we compared the IP address that App B had and the IP address that Server B currently had. Come to find out, App B had cached the IP address for Server B for App A. Since Server B was offline as it had been replaced by Server A, App B was saying that it could not connect to App A. It was at this point, I had to tell support agent for App B that he had to clear the DNS cache for App B and then try to connect again. He was not familiar with this so he had to reach out someone else to provide him the info on how to do this. Once he cleared the cache and restarted the process, the connection was successful. He was able to document those steps so that if the issue were to happen again in the future, that he would be prepared and not have to get additional people involved. 7) Minimize Distractions One thing that I have learned, is that modern work environment is not really conducive to getting a lot of work done. I have discovered that some people come to work extra early or stay extra late because they can get work done without being interrupted. What I had to start doing was to minimize the amount of distractions that were coming my way. Visual Distractions That notification that you got an email. That notification of a new instant message. That notification that there are updates for your computer. Turn them all off. If the email is that important, the sender will let you know by following up immediately. If the IM (instant message) is that important, they would have called or came directly to your desk. You can install the updates to your computer when you do not have to be actively working or after you leave for the day. Audio Distractions When I worked, I would listen to music or even audio books to block out the sounds of other people eating, gossiping, on meetings, or the toilet flushing. Sometimes the work required deep focus, such as analyzing the data in a spreadsheet or writing code for the automation that you are trying to build (see item 4). Email Management Email is one of those things that can easily get on your nerves. I had to leverage a number of built in features that Outlook has to get the most of out my email and scheduling. Rules and Categories Set up rules and categories in outlook based on keywords or senders that you get emails from. If you get emails that you know does not require you to read or perform any action on, then create a rule that will automatically send those emails to the trash. Create Meetings from Email Did you know that you can create a meeting invite from an email? What's more cool, is that the invite will have all of the people that were on the email included in it. All you have to do is open the email that you want to create a meeting for, click the \"Meeting\" button in the toolbar. The Meeting Request screen will appear so that you can finalize the details. Then you click Send. Group Conversations By grouping the email conversations by subject, it made it far easier for me to get through all of the emails that were in my inbox. If there was a email thread that I did not need to read or pay attention to, then I could delete the entire thread in a single actions since the thread was grouped together. Conclusion Working in the production support / help desk role can be difficult and very stressful at times. Hopefully these tips have provided you some strategies on how to make your help desk / support role easier to deal with.","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#7-lessons-learned-as-production-support-or-help-desk-agent","text":"","title":"7 Lessons Learned as Production Support or Help Desk Agent"},{"location":"technology/2020.01.10-7-lessons-from-production-support/#background","text":"I worked for 7 years in Production Support role.

Mind you, it would be like 3 PM when this question was asked and nobody, not even myself, wanted to stay at work later than necessary. In some situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was close, so it really was a wildfire. In other situations, the stakes were high and the deadline was at least 48 to 72 hours or more away, so the situation was a house fire that was next to a dry wooded wilderness (meaning it was not serious at the moment but had the potential to be). If the deadline that was given to you seems unrealistic to accomplish, ask the client why he or she stated that deadline. If you ask the right questions, there is a change that, you will have another day or two to get the issue addressed. However, the client will usually want the issue addressed immediately, as they did not calculate, want, or plan for the unexpected (a.k.a.

Initially I would sometimes work additional hours in addition to the time being on call. After experiencing some burnout of working 50 and 60+ hour weeks, that changed quickly. My perspective became that I would work the required 40 hours per week and on call as scheduled, but that was it. While some issues were quick to fix, other issues would take days to fix because of their complexity or effort required. Because of these reasons and more, I worked the minimum amount of hours, as you never know when that major production issue will come in.

One of those applications had a process that ran on the last three days of the month and the first of the month. Part of that process was that it wrote the date of the first of the month to that file. Problem was that when the process ran on the first of the month, the date was supposed to be for the previous month. For instance, if it was the end of October or the first of November, then we had to make sure that the date in the file was for the first of October. Come to find out, this was a bug that the development team had made a change to, but regression testing was not performed on it. The development team did not consider it urgent as there was a work around available and the business team had back log items that had to be completed by a particular deadline. What was being done by the agent that previously supported the application is that he was getting up in the early hours of the morning, around 1 AM, to manually update the date in the file and start the process. Once I took over the application, I had to start doing the same. What I would do is work my normal shift and then stay up until 1 AM to make the update and start the process as I did not want to sleep through the alarm as this process not running would have a major business impact. After about the third month, I had had enough of doing that and looked into automating it. What the previous agent and myself came up with was a shell script that would run at 1 AM, check the current date, and based on a number of if conditions, write the appropriate date to the file. After a confirmation run of the fix, this fix was presented to the development team. As a result, the development team added it to the code base.

Wes Bos created a website called uses.tech that is a collection of the users that have submitted their uses page to his repository. What Is A Uses Page? A uses page includes the things that a developer or other individual uses to do what they do best. For software developers, it may include the type of computer that they have, the IDE or text editor that they use, and the languages that they program with. How Do I Format My Uses Page? However you chose! When looking at other uses pages, I saw that some categorized their page based on the type of tools. Others categorized their set up in different ways. There is no particular way that it must be done other than the fact that you need to include the tools that you use. Some list out just the hardware and software that they use. Others get very detailed to include the hardware specifications, number of computers, and even photographing their home office or desk setup. Some even add the furniture that they have in their office as hardware components. You can look at the uses pages that have already been submitted on the uses.tech website for inspiration. On mine, I have included the software, computer hardware, and development environment details for my particular setup. Depending on what I am working on, I will use Linux or Windows. Therefore, I separated my software list by the operating system that I use it on. You can check out my uses page to see what my current set up includes. How Will Others Find My Uses Page? First you will need to create your uses page. Then, you will need to add it and other details about yourself to the awesome-uses repository. Once your pull request has passed all of the checks and is approved, your uses page will be listed on uses.tech website and in the README of the awesome-uses repository. How Did I Build My Uses Page? I came up with the organization of my uses page by doing the following in order: I looked at the Uses page of others that were listed on the uses.tech site as well as on GitHub to see what they included on their pages. I decided how I wanted to organize the content. Since I use multiple systems for my work, I decided to list each computer system or server as hardware and to separate the software by operating system. I also included the tools uses to build and manage this website. I provided links to some of the items that have websites for the products. That way visitors can download or purchase the same tools that you have. I published my uses page . I created an entry on the awesome-uses repo that pointed to the Uses page on my website. NOTE: I had some errors in my pull request to the awesome-uses repo. As a result, the CI would not allow my pull request to be sent for approval until I corrected the errors that it found.

Others get very detailed to include the hardware specifications, number of computers, and even photographing their home office or desk setup. Some even add the furniture that they have in their office as hardware components. You can look at the uses pages that have already been submitted on the uses.tech website for inspiration.

Here are some of the main reasons for making the switch: Drupal 7 has been replaced with Drupal 8. That means the content would need to be migrated to the new platform. However, all the functionality may not be available, as some modules are still being converted to work on Drupal 8. Blogging with a static site puts you at less risk of hacking, encountering database issues, and page load speed. I discuss this further in another post weighing the pros and cons of switching. Old Process with Drupal Login to Drupal Had to login to Drupal each time that I wanted to make an update to my blog. This mean that I was less likely to make that update over public WiFi, because public WiFi means that your site could be a greater risk for being hacked. Ignore that Message About Security Updates Available Now I did not always ignore this message, but majority of the time I did. Why? Because when the thought of a new content came to mind, I wanted to get as much of the thought out of my head and onto digital paper as possible. Fooling around and trying to get those updates installed before getting the thoughts out meant that I would risk loosing the thought, thus no new content. On the other prospective, not getting those security updates in place would leave the site at risk . Write The Content... In A Word Processor I know it does not make sense, but let me explain. While some browsers do have spell check, I have not ran across one that has grammar check. That said, I know that I make mistakes typing and have to go back and correct those mistakes. However, I would rather to get it right the first time than to have to correct it in a future update or somebody telling me about my mistake. Move the Content to the Website Once I have done all the grammar and spell checking in the word processor, I would then copy and paste that content into the website and preview it. With previewing, it would allow me to see that the content was formatted correctly before publishing. Once I would confirm that all was well, then I would publish the content. Take a Backup Since things could go wrong with Drupal when performing the database updates, per the Drupal documentation, it was recommended that you always backed up the database before running the database updates function. I have had a few sites go wrong when performing the database updates and it was not easy getting them back online since I did not have recent backups. In some of the modules, the maintainers were not using database transactions in their update functions. So if part of the update ran and failed, you would have a partial-ran database update but Drupal would see it as if the full update had completed successfully. Problem with Drupal seeing it as the full update running, is that it would not let you re-run that specific update again. So that meant that you had to either tinker in the database and manually update the version number to the previous version so that the database update could be ran again or restore the database with the backup and run the update again. Either of those options were not ideal and definitely were time consuming. Those Security Updates If I was using the right computer, I would then download the available security updates into my development computer. Confirmed that nothing blew up in the process with Drupal's database updater. Then commit those updates to my website's version control. Then pull the latest version into my production environment and run Drupal's database updater and prayed the entire time that things would work as they should. New Process with MkDocs Fetch Latest Repo On any computer of my choosing that has git installed, I can get the latest the latest version of Markdown code of my website and make updates to it. Edit in Text Editor or Word Processor Since the content that I am going to edit is already on the computer, I do not have to do anything special to get them into a word processor for editing. It is just as simple as File > Open > select the file > start typing. Save and Commit Once I have made all of the edits that need to be made, I can save my changes in the word processor and then commit them to my version control. Then push that branch up to the origin. Generate Static Files and Deploy I have my development environment set up with MkDocs. So I login to that server and run the git pull command followed by mkdocs gh-deploy command. The static HTML, CSS, and JS files are generated and committed to a local branch and then I am prompted to enter by GitHub credentials. Automated Pull in Production My production instance has a cronjob set up that does a pull of the branch that contains the static website. It does this pull several times per day. In a sense, it it like having a CD (continuous deployment) set up in that environment. Future Considerations Expanded CI-CD Setup One of the future goals that I have is to expand my current deployment set up so that it will periodically pull the master branch and automatically run the gh-deploy command on it. I looked into having all of this done in my production environment, but my website host provider will not allow me to install Python packages on their shared server. Thus will have to continue to generate the static website files locally. GitHub Actions GitHub Actions allows you to do testing and deployment when an event occurs on your repository. For example, if you push code from your remote to the origin, GitHub Actions can be triggered to run tests on the operating system of your choosing with whatever else is required to complete the testing (Python install, PHP install, etc). Based upon what I currently have in place, it seems to be the more viable option. I already have a script that runs in my production environment that periodically pulls the static website pages. Thus I never have to login to production to deploy my website.

Part of that new job meant learning technologies that was far different than what I was used to. This was a opportunity that I was looking forward to as it would expand my skill set and also give me something to share here with you. Some of the languages or frameworks that I have had to learn include ASP.Net Core MVC, Telerik, and Bootstrap. I was already familiar with Bootstrap as some of the websites that I maintain use it. However, I did not have a deep knowledge of it because the websites I maintain used Bootstrap themes that were already built. To become more familiar with the framework, I decided to redesign my website to use Bootstrap. Think of it as a personal coding boot camp. I have outlined the steps I followed to get Bootstrap integrated on my website and working. 1) Find A Template My first step was to go to the Bootstrap website to find an example template and to get documentation. From there, I was able to download the source code for the templates that are provided. The templates are very basic and they work right out of the box. 2) Integrating MkDocs Variables Integrating the variable names was rather easy. The MkDocs variable names and creating your own template steps are available on the MkDocs website . There are some variables that are not listed on the website, but are used in themes that have been created by other users. What I did was to view those themes and take snippets of the code from those themes to use in my theme. From there, I was able to adapt the snippets to my theme. When putting in the MkDocs variables, I recommend that you run the MkDocs server. When running the server, every time that you save a file, the page will refresh. When you code the variables, if you were to mistype a variable or enter in the wrong syntax, you will immediately see it as the page will refresh and show a white screen. If you check the log or terminal output, you will see what line that the error exists on in the stack trace. It may even mention the exact character that has caused the problem, as it did in some of my cases. 3) Source The Documentation Use CDN for Files The templates come with links to the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript) files to reference a file that is on your website. However, I did not want to add more files than necessary to my code base. Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) means that the files will load faster on the users' device because they are coming from a server that is closest to the user instead of the the server that your website is hosted at. Bootstrap provides the HTML to include in your page to link to CDN networks for CSS and JS files. This means that you do not have to maintain these additional files unless you choose to. There are two different versions of the files that are available. The provided HTML includes links to the minified files. Minified files have the white space and new line characters removed from the file so that the file size will be smaller. Class Names The documentation on the Bootstrap and W3Schools websites were helpful in finding out the class names to use. Some of the items, I was not finding what I was looking for so I did a internet search that would direct me to a blog post or Stack Overflow with the answer. Since I did not know the class names immediately off the top of my head, for some of the items, I would do inline styles with the style attribute. Then once I got the element to look the way that I wanted to, I would then find the classes that would give the same appearance. After understanding what the classes did, I began to remember some of them and would have to refer to the documentation less. Some of the class names have changed from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4. That means some of the posts that I would find on Stack Overflow and other websites were outdated because they were based on the Bootstrap 3 version. Thus when doing searches for recommendations on how to get an element to do something, I had to make sure that I included \"Bootstrap 4\" in my search query. So if you search and find the answer to your problem, and you use the class names that are provided and they do not change the output, then check to see if those class names apply for the Bootstrap version that you are using in your project. 4) Boostrap Icons Using Bootstrap Icons is not a requirement but I wanted some additional flair on my blog. Bootstrap has many icons that you can use on your website to enhance it. Some are available for free, but others require that you pay for a subscription to gain access. I opted for the free version. Boostrap Icons also has a CDN. The code to include on your website or project is available on the Bootstrap Icons website. By adding some code like <i class=\"bi bi-search\"></i> will place the search icon next to the element that you place it to. An example of this would be the search icon next to the search link in the footer of the page. 5) Additional Style Sheets There were some attributes that I wanted to override the Bootstrap defaults for. So I created my own stylesheet with custom classes to make these adjustments. There's nothing wrong with creating additional stylesheets. If you choose to have a local copy of the Bootstrap CSS instead of using one from a CDN, I would not recommend editing it. The reason being is that if you upgrade to a later Bootstrap version, you will have to copy out your customizations to the new version. It is far easier to have those customizations in a different file as it will be less maintenance later on. Minified File The custom stylesheet that I created does not have much styling in it. However, I did choose to minify the file. Will this have much improvement in page load speed? Probably not right now. If the file were to grow, then it may have an impact. 6) Images Some of the images that I have on my blog were in high resolution. The higher resolution images would extend beyond the div that they were located in. That made the page looked improper due to the oversized images. The fixes that I ran across was to add a class to each image to make it responsive. I did not want to do that as the image tag is generated by MkDocs. When looking through another MkDocs theme, I found the following and added it to my custom CSS file. img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; } The above code will make sure that all images do not exceed the maximum width of the div that they are contained in. Also, the height of the image will resize based upon the width so that the image is not stretched or skewed. 7) Google Custom Search Engine This is not related to getting Bootstrap setup on your website. However, as part the conversion, I implemented this functionality to my website. I decided to use the Google Custom Search Engine for my site instead of the built in search engine with MkDocs. One of the main reasons is how the search results are presented in MkDocs and that depending on what words you put in, you may or may not get what you expect in the result set. In addition, Google crawls my site just about weekly, so it would have the latest and best results to present to the user. Conclusion I have learned a lot about Bootstrap by converting my website to it. This approach of doing a custom theme and redesign of my website, did help me learn more of Bootstrap. I will admit that I do not know how to do everything with Bootstrap, but I do know where to look for the answers to the things that I do not know and that I am better prepared for my project at work. Issue #71 on my website repository was opened for this conversion. You can take a look at my repository and the commits that were made for this conversion.","title":"Lacing Up My Bootstrap"},{"location":"technology/2020.02.08-lacing-up-my-bootstrap/#background","text":"As some of you may know, I started a new job late 2019.

Input and Output The commands entered into the terminal look like the following almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ input command and the output from running the command look like the following I'm some output Raw Log File The entire unmodified log file is available for download. Some of the inputs, due to typos, are difficult to read due to the way that PuTTY generates the log files. CSV Data Files CSV data files were generated using generatedata.com . Next Training Session Future training sessions have not been scheduled at this time. If you are interested in attending a future session, you can reach out to me via the contact page to let me know that you are interested. Once the next session has been scheduled, a notification will be sent out with the details. In addition, sessions will be listed on this website when they are scheduled. Let The Session Begin To ensure that everyone was able to see my screen, I ran the top command as it periodically refreshes the data on the screen. Once we had screen sharing going, the training got started. Whats Running On The System The top command shows the current CPU usage as well as the processes that are currently running, memory usage, and system up-time. This is similar to the Task Manager in Windows.

Thus the command below will change to the parent directory of the current directory. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd .. almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ pwd /home Each user has a home directory. To go back to your home directory, you enter the command below in. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:/home$ cd Creating New Folder To create a new folder, you use the command below. You will need to replace anewfolder with the name of the folder that you want to create. This command does not return any output. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ mkdir nanewfolder Once you have ran the command above, you can use the ls command to confirm that the folder has been created. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Predefined Aliases On some systems, the directories are highlighted a different color from the files. Ubuntu is one of the systems that does this out of the box. The reason is because there is an alias defined for the ls command. I showed what was really running when performing the ls by showing the alias. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ alias ls alias ls='ls --color=auto' Removing Folders and Files If you attempt to remove a directory without specifying the recursive option, the system will complain that the action cannot be done. The system will not allow you to delete a folder without deleting the child elements in that folder because that would leave the child elements orphaned on the system. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm anewfolder/ rm: cannot remove 'anewfolder/': Is a directory almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt anewfolder data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt The recursive option still must be used even if the directory is empty. This time the remove command is run with the recursive option and the folder is removed. The rm command does not return any output unless there is an error executing the command. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm -r anewfolder/ almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt Below are examples of commands that you do not want to run. If you do run any of the commands, they will result in the entire file system being deleted. Some of these require that the executing user have sudo permissions. The commands in the example below have been commented out so that they cannot be intentionally run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -r /* almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # rm -rf /* The equivalent of the above commands is going to the root / directory and running the commands below. The commands in the example have intentionally been commented out so that they cannot be easily run. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cd / almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ ls almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ # do not run almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ # rm -r f f * To find all of the options an example of the rm command, you can enter in the the help argument to the command. The help page wil display different output depending on the distrubution of Linux that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ rm --help For more information about the command, you can use the man page. The output from this will vary depending on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:/$ man rm Autocomplete can be used with the rm command as well. Just type part of the file name and double press the Tab key to have the system type the rest of the file or to present you with files that match the pattern. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm cop copiedfile.csv copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ rm copyofsample* copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt Below, I show that \"sample\" as the pattern matched two files. However, \" s e*\" matches three files. Using this wildcard pattern can result in you deleting files that you do not want to delete. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls *s*e* almostengr.txt copyofsample2.txt copyofsample.txt If you are not sure what all files will match a pattern, run the pattern of your choice with the ls command first before running the rm command. Recovering Deleted Files Recovering delete files on Linux is not an easy task unless you use a disk recovery utility. On Windows-based systems, when a file is deleted, it goes to the Recycle Bin. Linux has no concept of the Recycle Bin. There is a way that the Recycle Bin concept can be done. To set up your makeshift Recycle Bin on Linux, you can create an alias for the rm command or use a different alias that will move the file to a different directory instead of deleting the file. alias rm=\"mv $@ /var/tmp\" If you use the command above as an alias, any time that you use the rm command, it will move the file to the /var/tmp directory instead. Periodically, you will need to \"empty the trash\" by removing the files from the /var/tmp directory. Clear The Screen Clearing the screen will do what it says. The prompt will be moved to the top of the screen. On some systems, this will limit whether you can scroll back or not. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ clear Copying Files To display the help information for using the file copy, use the --help option. The help page will vary based on the Linux distribution that you are using. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp --help This is the list of directory contents before performing a file copy. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls almostengr.txt data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy kenny.txt If you do not remember the filename that you want to copy or the filename is long that you do not want to type it, then you can use auto-complete to have the system complete the filename for you. Start by typing part of the file name in the prompt. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p d Then double press the Tab key and you will get the following. data2.csv data.csv dirtocopy/ Since there are multiple matches for files that start with \"d\", the system will not automatically guess which one that you are trying to type. Instead it will list all of the files that match the criteria that you have defined so that you can pick which one. The same will happen now that we have typed \"data\" in the prompt as there are two files that being with \"data\" in this directory. From here we can type an additional character that matches the file that we want to use in our command and it will complete the rest of the filename. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data data2.csv data.csv \"data2.csv\" is the file that is being copied to \"copiedfile.csv\". To confirm that the file has been copied, we run the ls command with the file names that were used in the cp command as arguments to only show those two files. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp -p data2.csv copiedfile.csv almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al data2.csv copiedfile.csv Since we used the -p option in our file copy, the original and copied file will have the same last modified date and time. -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 copiedfile.csv -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 6595 Mar 1 05:40 data2.csv Going to copy the file that we created to another file. This time without using the preserve option. Also going to use the wild card with the ls command to show both files instead of specifying each file name. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cp sample.txt copysofsample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al *sample* -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:15 copyofsample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Since the -p option was not used when copying the file, the copied file will have the current timestamp (22:15). Creating Files To create a file, you can use the touch command. The file will be created with the name that you provide. almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ touch sample.txt almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ ls -al sample.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 almostengr almostengr 0 Mar 1 22:12 sample.txt Viewing File Contents There are many ways of viewing file contents. To display an entire file on the screen, you use cat . almostengr@linuxtraining:~$ cat data2.csv id,first_name,last_name,email,region,country 1,Christian,Walls,non.hendrerit.id@a.net,Manitoba,Spain

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified. In most circumstances, this listing will not be useful as it will not have any of the date or time information presented. almostengr@linuxtraining:/etc$ ls -1t mailcap systemd shells host.conf python sysctl.d tmpfiles.d legal rc0.d security groff networks rc1.d modules-load.d logcheck profile rc2.d dpkg polkit-1 manpath.config rc3.d alternatives subgid- pam.conf rc4.d skel subuid- bash.bashrc rc5.d vim kernel bash_completion rc6.d ssh pm mke2fs.conf logrotate.d ssl X11 zsh_command_not_found init.d localtime network updatedb.conf fail2ban timezone crypttab debconf.conf default sudoers.d acpi ucf.conf bash_completion.d dhcp apm hdparm.conf monit apparmor gss at.deny python2.7 hostname perl nanorc ld.so.cache locale.gen fonts magic update-motd.d subgid kernel-img.conf magic.mime cron.weekly subuid mtab libaudit.conf cron.daily gshadow terminfo gai.conf update-manager group vtrgb rsyslog.conf lvm shadow newt login.defs apparmor.d passwd python3 securetty apport netplan iproute2 sudoers ufw machine-id xdg sysctl.conf rsyslog.d pollinate cron.hourly crontab profile.d fstab cron.monthly overlayroot.conf cloud issue ca-certificates.conf logrotate.conf vmware-tools issue.net modules deluser.conf pam.d os-release nsswitch.conf rmt cryptsetup-initramfs lsb-release ca-certificates debian_version mdadm passwd- dbus-1 inputrc modprobe.d shadow- adduser.conf sos.conf cron.d hosts.allow resolv.conf protocols iscsi hosts.deny environment rpc initramfs-tools NetworkManager ld.so.conf.d services console-setup dnsmasq.d selinux ltrace.conf grub.d rcS.d opt mailcap.order udev dnsmasq.d-available hosts mime.types python3.6 group- update-notifier bindresvport.blacklist ldap gshadow- ethertypes ld.so.conf thermald byobu landscape screenrc depmod.d popularity-contest.conf wgetrc fuse.conf networkd-dispatcher calendar binfmt.d apt libnl-3 locale.alias Listing Only Directories You can list only the directories using the ls command.

As you see, the most recent files will show up at the bottom of the screen. When there are a number of files in a directory, those files will flood the screen which means you will have to scroll back to see the files at the beginning. The command ls -alt will place the most recently modified files at the top of the list and oldest files at the bottom. If you are looking for the oldest files, then you would not have to scroll back to find them. It is possible to list the files by time without displaying the timestamp of when the file or directory was last modified.

should only have one reason to change Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY) put repetitive code into functions group functions into cohesive classes; dealing with the same responsbility group classes by folders and namespaces by responsibiltiy, level of abstraction, etc further group class folders into projects Dependency Inversion Would you solder a lamp directly into the electrical wiring in a wall? invert (and inject) dependencies both high level classes and implementation-detail classes should depend on abstractions (interfaces); should not be hard coded classes should follow explicit dependencies principle; classes should be explicit about all of the classes that they need; dependencies are defined in the class constructor make your types honest, not deceptive dont have a constructor with a lot of dependencies. consider using additional classes if this is the case advised not to use property dependency injection abstractions/inferfaces must be defined somewhere accessible by low level implemetnation services high level business services user interface entry points;

As a result, I had to search around on the internet to figure out how to create templates for my website which is made with MkDocs. After doing some digging on other websites, I found that MkDocs uses Jinja for the templating engine. From there, I was able to find some of the documentation on how to use the values and variables in a template. Since I was creating a website with a blog, I wanted to sort the content by the most recent first. The problem with this is that using the for function, it would sort the content from oldest to newest. Again, I could not figure out how to reverse the order as this was not documented in the Jinja documentation where I could find it nor was it on Stack Overflow. Out on a limb, I typed the below and believe it or not, it sorted the content in reverse order just like how I wanted it to. {% for nav_item in nav | reverse %} /// whatever you want to loop over {% endfor %} The Break Down Let's break down the parts of the code. Start The Loop {% for This denotes the beginning of the for loop. The space between the parenthesis and the word \"for\" is required. Otherwise the command will not be intepreted as you expect and thus not work. Iterator Variable nav_item In this example, the \"nav_item\" is the name of the variable that is used within the for loop. For those of you that are familiar with writing foreach loops in Java or C#, \"i\" is commonly used for this same purpose. foreach(item in collection){ // do something } \"item\" in the example above would be the same as \"nav_item\" in Jinja example. Collection or Array \"nav\" is the collection or array of items that will be looped over one by one. This variable can be changed to loop over other items that are available, such as page variables or configuration variables. Reverse The Items | reverse This part of the command, will sort the items in the collection or array in reverse. If your items are sorted by date, then the most recent date would be first. If your items are sorted by alphabet, then the end of the alphabet (\"Z\") would be first. Close The Loop {% endfor %} This closes the end of the for loop.

After doing some digging on other websites, I found that MkDocs uses Jinja for the templating engine. From there, I was able to find some of the documentation on how to use the values and variables in a template. Since I was creating a website with a blog, I wanted to sort the content by the most recent first. The problem with this is that using the for function, it would sort the content from oldest to newest. Again, I could not figure out how to reverse the order as this was not documented in the Jinja documentation where I could find it nor was it on Stack Overflow. Out on a limb, I typed the below and believe it or not, it sorted the content in reverse order just like how I wanted it to. {% for nav_item in nav | reverse %} /// whatever you want to loop over {% endfor %}","title":"Background"},{"location":"technology/2020.07.15-reverse-sort-for-mkdocs/#the-break-down","text":"Let's break down the parts of the code.","title":"The Break Down"},{"location":"technology/2020.07.15-reverse-sort-for-mkdocs/#start-the-loop","text":"{% for This denotes the beginning of the for loop.

scheduled on your system to run to certain intervals. Otherwise you have to manually run these task which will increase your manual workload. In this video, I show you how to set up this automated process. Video Transcript (Unedited) AS PART OF THE CONVERSION OF MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS I ALSO INSTALLED CIVI CRM AND SO SYMPATHY RM REQUIRES A CRON TASK OR A ROUTINE SCHEDULER THAT KICKS OFF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE PROCESSES WHETHER HOURLY OR DAILY AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE A SHELL SCRIPT AS WELL AS DOWNLOADED THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TOOL THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO ALL OF THAT SO I'M GOING TO COVER THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS VIDEO WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO ONCE AGAIN SO HERE WE HAVE THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I CREATED FOR RUNNING CIVI CRM CRIME AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN SUPER CRM YOU HAVE A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE PROCESSES THERE PREFER TO AS SCHEDULED TASKS AND THE SYSTEM EXCUSE ME SCHEDULED JOBS AND SO I'M GOING TO ADMINISTER SYSTEM SETTINGS AND SCHEDULED JOBS WILL BRING YOU TO THIS PAGE AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS TASKS SUCH AS CLEANING IT UP TEMPORARY DATA CHECKING FOR UPDATES CHECKING EMAILS WHETHER IT'S PROCESSING EMAILS OR FETCHING EMAILS THAT HAVE BOUNCED FROM YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SO THEY RUN AT VARIOUS INTERVALS AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CIVI CRM REQUIRES THAT YOU SET UP A TASK SCHEDULER OR A CRON JOB AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT THAT COULD BE DONE USING THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE TOOL AND SO IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CIVI CRM WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS CV DOT FAR FILE OR CAR I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PH IS FAR FAR FAR AWAY AND SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN VARIOUS THINGS IN CIVI CRM AND PERFORM VARIOUS ACTIONS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE THE WP COMMAND LINE OR WORDPRESS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO RUN IT AND IT GIVES YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO IF YOU RUN IT LIKE I JUST DID HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN PHP AND THEN PASS THE FILE NAME AS A ARGUMENT TO THE PHP CALL BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY A PHP SCRIPT OF SORTS AND SO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE YOU CAN MAKE CALL TO THE APIS YOU CAN CALL THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS HERE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RUN THE CRIME PROCESS AND SO I HAVE THAT POOL OF DUCK AND SO HERE IS THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I HAVE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION YOU CAN GO TO THE REPOSITORY FOR MY WEBSITE I HAVE A LINK TO THE POSIT OR E DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW AND YOU CAN MAKE A COPY OF THIS SCRIPT AND SO BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHECKS IT STARTS OFF WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THIS URL PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I GOT THE

(Unedited)"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.16-college-programming-course-files-on-github/","text":"Background As I was cleaning off files on my computer recently, I found files that I had from college. Some of these files were from the classes that I took. Some are from the classes that others took and I helped them with their coursework. I figured I would share this code online for several reasons. I outline these reasons below and provide a warning for students that are currently in college. Reason 1: Reference Material When you get started in your career after college, sometimes you may want to refer to those programs or code that you wrote in college. Sometimes the code or components that I used, like a regular expression that validates email addresses that I used in my MIS 320 Application Design class, still works today. I will be honest, I have never sourced that expression from my old code, but I do remember it being there and could use it if I needed to. Reason 2: See Your Growth In order to see how much you have improved in your skills, you need to have evidence of what you previously did ( see Reason 1 ). By saving my work from when I was in college, I am now able to see how I previously wrote code. When I was in college, Visual Basic and C++ were the primary languages being taught. As I am writing this post in 2020, the primary languages that are being used are C#, Python, Java, and Python. If you are writing new code in Visual Basic, you will probably get laughed at or questioned unless you are writing a macro for a Microsoft Office program or something similar. Technology Shift As you can see, what were the primary languages circa 2010 and what they are circa 2020, have changed. This change is in part, has been because technology has moved towards using more web-based applications instead of desktop applications, increased use of technology on mobile devices, and designing applications and websites that work on multiple platforms. Reason 3: Portfolio Once you get close to graduation, you will begin to look for a job in your field. More and more employers are more concerned with the work experience that you have instead of your GPA or the institution that you attended. Why is the case? In some schools, it is easy to cheat and pass a class. While cheating can get you suspended or expelled (there were some in my classes that did get caught), learning how the tools used to detect cheating can be scapegoated. Long story short, you can pass a class and not learn anything from said class. When you talk about your experience, sometimes they will ask to see your work. As I have previously conducted interviews in the past, the reason that the interviewer wants to see your existing code or to write out code in an interview, is not necessarily to see if you will get the coding problem correct. It is to see how you think and whether you understand coding design patterns. Why Not Focus on Getting Coding Problems Right? There are many ways to write code. For example, in C# (C-Sharp), which of the following code blocks is correctly written? int x = 1; Figure 1 int x; x = 1; Figure 2 Some would say that both are correct because they do the same thing. Figure 2 takes more steps to accomplish the same task. Some would say that Figure 1 is correct because the code is more concise. In my opinion, they are both correct for the reasons stated. However, if you are following design patterns and principles like SOLID and DRY, you would know that Figure 1 is the best way of writing this code. Experience vs. Grades Please do not mistaken what I mean when I say that experience is more important than grades. That does not mean that you can fail your classes and still be successful. While grades do not necessarily reflect ones skill set (because of built in biases in exams and curriculum), they do reflect the level of commitment that an individual had during their collegiate tenure. Experience is valued more because you have demonstrated your knowledge in a given subject. What are examples of experience that you can gain? Interships Both paid and not paid count. This will give you the least experience points because they are only done for short amounts of time (usually during the summer). Co-op . This is a program where the college or university partner with a company that allow you get on the job training and work while enrolled in school. This offers you greater experience points in my opinion as you usually work for an entire year full time (alternating school semesters). Running a business Want to build websites for a living? Then starting a business doing that is the best way to gain experience. The involvement required to run a business, will earn you way more experience points of all because you have to have multiple skillsets to run a business. Word of Caution If you are currently enrolled in school, I would not suggest that you post the code that you are working on online until after the end of the semester or school year. Why not? I have ran across some Reddits and forums that mention how some students posted their homework online. Then one of their classmates did a search and was able to find it, copy it, and turn it in. It was all downhill from there. Online Situation In one instance, the original writer of the code posted asking what he should do about his situation. The teacher ran the code through a plagiarism tool. This tool compares your code to the code of other students and provides a match percentage of duplication. This is a common practice with schools that have large number of students taking Computer Science courses. In this scenario, it flagged the code of this and another student's as they were exactly the same. This resulted disciplinary action being given to the original writer of the code as he submitted his assignment after plagiarizer. However, the date and timestamps on GitHub, showed that he had wrote and committed the code before the plagiarizer had submitted his homework. I do not know how this situation ended. However, it could have been avoided by the original writer not posting his code online until after the assignment due date had passed. Personal Experience - MIS 320 In this class , we had an assignment that involved Javascript . Mind you, most of the class had never seen Javascript, let alone understood the syntax for it because we were taught Visual Basic throughout most of our collegiate career. That being said, a group of students spent one night in the computer lab trying to get the assignment completed. From what I recall, one person in the lab managed to figure out how to complete the assignment. Then shared it with the other students who were in the lab. They submitted the homework for grading. After the assignments were graded, the teacher made an announcement in class that a number of the assignments looked very similar (translation: looked plagiarized) and that if it happens again, he would be submitting the students' names to the Dean's Office for Academic Misconduct violations. Conviction of academic misconduct could suspension or expulsion. After that announcement, there were no more instances of that happening in that class. Personal Experience - CS 375 In this course , there was a similar incident to the above that took place. We had a homework assignment that was to be completed individually. One of the classmates, whom I also worked with at the university's IT department, was in the same class. The entire class managed to struggle with this assignment, so most turned in what they had working as we were told to turn in what we did have working and we would at least get some credit for the parts that did work. This student managed to get it fully working and shared it with some of the classmates that he sat near. That was big mistake as his code matched 2-3 other students in the class (the ones that he sat near or was friends with). The teacher immediately reported this Academic Misconduct to the dean's office in addition to making an announcement in class about the infraction and the action that had been taken. From what I recall, the student that provided the code was immediately suspended and lost his job (as he was a student employee, but no longer a student), and the other students that plagiarized the code were forced to drop the class (thus impacting their GPA and possibly delaying their graduation). In addition, all the students involved, have the Academic Misconduct on their collegiate records. Conclusion Putting your code online further validates that you have experience in the IT (Information Technology) industry. Furthermore, if perspective employers want to see your work, they can do so at their leisure. However, posting your code too soon, can result in your career path being altered in a way that you would least expect. I am not sure if my perspective employers looked at my GitHub repos when considering me for a job. However, I do provide this information to further backup my claim and discussions of my past programming and technology experience. Even putting code snippets online will help you out as they can be searched and used by yourself and others.

The only problem was that the customer had not received the chair. It was scheduled to be delivered on the same day that I was scheduled to assemble it, but that did not happen. I advised the customer to contact Customer Service and let them know of the issue. While the customer was waiting on hold, she asked me what did I do for a living. I told her that I assemble furniture and other handyman work part-time and work full-time in IT (Information Technology). Her eyes got real big and she asked if I could take a look at her printer once she got done with the call and I agreed. The Setup The customer had a laptop with Windows 10 and a HP Deskjet 2600 Series printer. This particular printer is designed to be connected to Wifi, but uses USB connection for the initial setup. She previously had another HP printer, but replaced it with the Deskjet 2600 one. She said that she had got it working at one point, but that it had stopped working and she was not sure why. Here are the various tasks that I did in order to get them working. I do not remember the exact order that they were done it, but I want to provide you with a checklist in case you run into the same issue. Reinstall Printer Drivers or Software First thing was to reinstall the printer drivers. The user already had the HP Printer Toolbox installed on the computer. It had the printer already configured in it like I previously mentioned. However, even a print test page would not print from the software. I performed the setup several times. The way that you have to set this printer up is to Install the HP software on your computer Connect the printer to the computer via USB cable Run the HP software setup configuration. This will ask you for the wireless settings to use and whether the device is on the network. Disconnect the USB cable Then the software will try to find the printer via the network. If it does not find it, then it will complain and ask that you try the setup again. This did not work for the probably 5 times that I tried it. Thus I figured I would check something else, which was the network itself. Assign A Static IP Address This printer connects to the network via Wifi. If you are familiar with how DHCP and the assigning of IP addresses work, then you can probably skip this section. For those of you that are not, continue reading. HP printers can print out a status sheet. This sheet includes everything from the IP address, software version, model number, ink or toner level and more. Often times, it prints all of this information on more than one sheet of paper (in this case printed 3 pages and was still going before I cancelled the print job). The customer had previously printed out one of the pages. On this print out, it had the IP address as 192.168.1.3. However, on the computer, one of the screens showed that it had the IP address mapped to 192.168.1.4. For those of you that are not familiar with IP addresses, this would be the equivalent of somebody giving you the address to a place, and everything in the address is correct but the house number. Thus resulting in you ending up at the wrong destination. Since the IP address changed between installation and usage, the computer was sending the print job to a device that was not on the network at the address specified (i.e. nobody was home). What I did was to go in the customer's router and assign the printer a static IP address. That way every time the printer connects to the network, it will always have the same IP address. Print A Test Page There are more than the two ways that you can print a test page. Below are the two ways that I tried to print something when diagnosing this issue. From Control Panel From the Control Panel, you can print a test page. Go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Right on the printer > Properties > Print Test Page. I tried this several times, but it would not print the test page. I checked the printer queue and it showed that the Test Page job was being sent and queued up, but it would error out and did not really give a reason or explanation about the error. From Word or Text Editor The alternative would be to type some text into an empty Word document and try to print it. This did not work either and errored out like the print from the Control Panel. Turn It Off and Back On \"Did you try turning it off and back on again?\" People that do not work in technology or understand it really underestimate how this simple step can correct a lot of tech or electronic problems. I had restarted the printer several times and it still was not getting the print jobs. I am not sure why this was the case. Then it came to mind to restart the computer. It was a Windows computer after all and most of the time when you install software on Windows, it is best to restart to make sure all the changes are applied as some software has to do stuff after the restart completes. Did the restart and after the Desktop appeared, the Word document I had attempted to print actually started printing. It was still in the print queue when I shut the computer down. Conclusion Did a few more prints just to confirm that all was still good and everything printed correctly as it should. I share this story about the printer issues in case you are having problems with yours. The biggest takeaway from this that I would recommend is that if you have a network printer, that setting it up to have a static IP address that is assigned by the router would eliminate this headache or printer connection issues in the future.","title":"HP Wireless Printer Problems"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.19-hp-wireless-printer-problems/#background","text":"I had a job for a chair assembly for a customer. The only problem was that the customer had not received the chair. It was scheduled to be delivered on the same day that I was scheduled to assemble it, but that did not happen.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the drop downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well. 24-hour clock Bash Command echo \"<select>\" for h in {0..23}; do for m in {0..5}; do echo \"<option

realized that in my particular situation, that the values that were being returned from the database were in the 24-hour clock, but the documentation and mockups that we had for the screen that this time list was to be used on, was in the 12-hour clock. Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above. I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database. The rest of the command remained the same.

Previously, I had used a Kendo time picker. This meant that the selection was able to be completed with about 7 lines of code. However, it was considered to be defective when the QA (quality assurance) testing was done because when you typed in a time, it would not select that time from the drop down list. The reason that it would not select the time when it was, manually keyed in, is because the Kendo date picker tag helper that was used, uses a input field for the drop downs instead of using a select list, as you would think that it would use. Using bash, I was able to create the list of options for the time increments that I needed instead of typing each one out manually. As previously mentioned, the times had to be in 10 minute increments. I originally done the times for the 24-hour clock. However, I needed it for 12-hour clock, so I have created that option list as well.","title":"Background"},{"location":"technology/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times/#24-hour-clock","text":"","title":"24-hour

Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above. I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database.

As you may know, Git was created by the same person that created Linux, Linus Torvalds. Thus it should be no suprise that the primary way of using Git is with the command line. When I started doing work that involved coding in C# (C-Sharp), that meant that I had to become familiar with Visual Studio. Mind you, I had not seriously used Visual Studio in several years. The last version I remember using was Visual Studio 2012. At the time of this writing, Visual Studio 2019 is the current version. In addition to the learning adjustment that I had to do for using the 2019 version of it, I also had to figure out how to use Git within Visual Studio. Let's just say that it was not that easy coming from years of working with command line. My particular work setup was not configured so that I can use Git Bash from the command line, terminal, or Package Manager Console within Visual Studio. Thus I have no way of manually running the commands that I am familiar with when it comes to Git and had to learn how to navigate a GUI version of Git. You Can Still See That? I was working with another developer on some code and mentioned that they could check out my branch to see what I had done. They asked whether to checkout the July branch or the August branch. Now I knew that I had deleted the July branch from the server and from my local repo, but was puzzled when they inquired. Afterwards, I double checked the server and sure enough it had been removed, yet they were still able to see it. Come to find out, when you do a sync of the origin (the server side) to your local in Visual Studio 2019, it does not remove the branches that no longer exist by default. Thus you end up with stale branches taking up space on your computer that probably have no use. There Is A Setting For That I did a bit of online research to see if something was wrong. Come to find out, there are many of posts and message board questions about how to address this. For Visual Studio 2019, there is a setting that has to be changed in order for it to remove the old branches that no longer exist on origin. By default, this setting is set to \"Unset\". This is similar to the equivalent of setting a boolean value to \"null\" (which should not and in some languages cannot be done). To change this setting, you will need to do the following. Open Visual Studio 2019 Go to the Team Explorer window Settings (via the home) Change the \"Prune remote branches during fetch\" option to True Save and close After you change this setting, each time that you do a fetch or sync, the branches that are no longer on the remote will be removed. In my opinion, I think that this needs to be the default behavior as it keeps your repository smaller and cleaner.","title":"Prune Branches In Visual Studio"},{"location":"technology/2020.09.12-prune-branch-in-visual-studio/#background","text":"Majority of my experience with Git has been via the command line.

Here are some ways that Github can be used a Content Management System (CMS). Little Tech Knowledge Required Once the website it set up on Github (most likely by a technical user), non-technical users can make the updates to the website from the Github website. Very little assistance would be needed as there is plenty of documentation on Github about how to update an existing repository and similar amount of documentation about how to do formatting with Markdown. No SSH or SFTP When updating some Content Management Systems or their plugins, you have to manually login to the server and upload the new files. Most non-technical users are not familiar with SSH or SFTP. Thus if they want to keep their website from being hacked or extending its functionality, then they would have to learn these things. This knowledge is not required if you want to add features to your website when hosted by Github. Depending on what you feature you are trying to implement, you can just login to the Github website, make the necessary updates, and commit the changes... all within the web browser. No Plugin or Module Updates or Vulnerabilities When you are not using Wordpress or Drupal, there are no plugins or modules to update. That means that you spend less time doing maintenance on your website and more time actually creating content and getting work done. Plugins or site updates are when the most hacking attempts take place. When it comes to Drupal, there was a security patch notice that was sent out to users that had subscribed to their update alerts. In a follow up announcement, Drupal mentioned that if you had not updated your website within 7 hours of the notice being sent, then consider your website hacked or compromised . That basically means that if you were not reading the email as soon as it was received and began performing the update, your website was probably compromised. Nobody is ever just waiting for an unannounced email to be received. One of my websites fell victim to a hacking attempt. I will admit, having backups of your database are helpful when those things occur. That the most recent backup did not have a number of recent changes, so it took more effort to restore the website as the bad data and files had to be removed from the server and the database cleaned up so that it would not reference them and throw errors. Leverage Github Actions Some of the features that you would normally have build into a website that is based on a Content Management System, such as sending out newsletters, can still be done through the use of Github Actions. While the implementation of some of these features may be more involved than installing a plugin on to a website, there is a great chance that you will not have to update them that often or at all once they are implemented. Spell Check Example For example, on this website, I have a spell check action enabled through Github Actions. It is configured that each time an update is pushed to Github, that the spell check is performed. If a misspelled word is found, then that update is not allowed to be deployed to production. Thus the mistakes that exist on your website are few to none. SSG (Static Site Generator) Most websites do not need to have the complexity of a social media, banking, or online learning website. This is especially true for those of you who have a website that is solely used as a blog. Thus why would you use a tool that is more complex than what is required for the job. That would be the equivalent of driving an 18-wheeler to pick up your 2 kids from school... doing way to much. Github allows you to build websites using Jekyll, which is one of many SSGs (Static Site Generator) that exist. This website uses MkDocs, a SSG that is made with Python. SSGs allow you to write your content in Markdown or HTML and through the use of templates, converts each file into a full HTML page. At the time of this writing, there are about 120 blog posts and another 15 pages on the site that have to be generated. This takes about 5 seconds per build run to generate all the HTML, CSS, and JS files that are used on the website. That's pretty quick if you need to make a site-wide color change or template change. Conclusion If you are using Drupal or Wordpress for your blog, consider switching to a static website that is generating with Github. There are many features that will make website updates easy that you can add on through the use of Github Actions.","title":"Github as Content Management System (CMS)"},{"location":"technology/2020.09.22-github-as-content-management-system/#background","text":"Some time ago, I wrote about me converting my website from a database-driven Content Management System (CMS) website to a static website that uses a Static Site Generator (SSG).

The channel already existed for some time, there was not many videos uploaded to the channel in past years and we were trying to increase the subscriber count. One of the ways to increase the subscriber count is to meet the best practices that YouTube recommends. One of those recommendations is to have a channel trailer. Get The Images Over the years, there have been a number of images uploaded to the Instagram account for the organization. Instagram makes it rather difficult for you to download the images that you have previously posted once you upload them. In order for me to get the content that had been previously uploaded, I had to go into the Settings and then request a download of the Instagram Data. Depending on the amount of content that you have previously uploaded, it may take some time for Instagram to provide you with the data. In this particular scenario, it took about 3 hours for me to receive the email notification that the download was ready. Once you have received the email notification, you have to go back to Instagram and it will present you with the option of downloading the data. The data download is provided as a zip file. As you see, there are a number of files. All of your captions, comments, and more are provided in the download. The part I am most interested in is the Photos folder. Inside of this folder, the photos are grouped by the year and month that they were posted. FFMPEG While I could have used another tool for this process, I wanted to figure out a fast way to do this. Thus it immediately came to mind to use ffmpeg to make the video from the photos. How did I come to this thought? When setting up automations with ffmpeg previously, I found out that it is a very powerful tool when it comes to outputting things as video. Just have to know what commands to use, or know what commands somebody else has used, to get it to do what you want it to do. Thus to get the images that I wanted into a video file, I created the below script. The Script #!/bin/bash # create a video slide show from a folder of images # information sourced from https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Slideshow ## remove existing files rm output.mp4 list.txt ## loop through the files and subfiles in the directory for filename in $(find . -name '*.jpg') do echo \"file '${filename}'\" >> list.txt echo duration 2 >> list.txt done ## run create the video file ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -vsync vfr -pix_fmt rgb24 output.mp4 Latest version of this script that I am using is available in my Ubuntu Automation repository . Script Breakdown I got some of the commands from the FFMPEG Documentation . Leveraging the documentation, also known as RTFM , can be helpful. First, the script removes the existing output.mp4 and list.txt files. The previous files are removed because ffmpeg will either prompt to overwrite or automatically exit, depending on the options you select, when it sees an output file that already exists. Next, it will loop through all the files that are in the directory or child directories looking for files that end with \".jpg\". If you have files in a different format, you can change the extension to match the files in your directory. Next, each image filename is added to list.txt and the duration that the picture should be displayed is added to the list.txt file between each image. One thing that I did note with this, is that the first image tends to stay up longer than the specified amount of seconds. In my scenario, the first image was displayed for about 3.5 seconds. Not sure why that is the case, but it was. Finally, after looping through all of the images, ffmpeg is called with various arguments to generate the video file from the images. Additional Editing I wanted to have some text overlays in the video, such as organization branding and social media information. Thus after the video had been rendered by ffmpeg, I used Kdenlive to add these additional elements to the video. Then that output was uploaded to the organization's YouTube channel as the channel trailer. If you would like to check out the final version of that video, then you can watch it on YouTube .","title":"FFMPEG for Image Slideshow"},{"location":"technology/2020.10.10-ffmpeg-for-image-slideshow/#background","text":"I needed to create a YouTube channel trailer for another channel that I manage for an organization.

During that update, I recorded a lot of the coding work that I had to update the website. In honor of Engineers Week 2021, I will be releasing a video every day this week discussing some of the coding and the building of the new website. Previous Website The previous version of the website was ran on Drupal 7. Since Drupal 7 was getting close to retirement, I figured that this would be the best time to make any upgrades and improvements to the website. There were some features from the existing website that I wanted to include, such as payment for memberships, being able to contact us to participate in community events, and information about the organization. Those features were all able to be implemented on the website through the use of modern technology and some custom coding solutions. Current Website I went ahead and updated the website to be a static website that uses a static site generator (SSG) to create the pages. This allows the content to be written in plain text files. Once the files have been saved, the SSG will take the content from the plain text files and put it into templated HTML files, which results in static HTML files. Those static HTML files can then be deployed to the website server. Completed Work You can catch watch the playlist of the video series on YouTube channel . You can visit the chapters website at nsbe-mp.org . Comments and questions about this project can be left on the YouTube video.","title":"Website Project for Engineers Week 2021"},{"location":"technology/2021.02.23-engineers-week-2021/#previous-website","text":"The previous version of the website was ran on Drupal 7.

Links https://github.com/almostengr/nsbe-mp.org Transcript (Unedited) welcome back i am continuing the process of the update on the website and i know you're probably thinking like how many parts this is going to be well it's going to be a is it it may end up being a lot of parts and the reason being because i want you to be able to watch this in smaller segments instead of trying to do the entire project in one large long video um that way it's easier to you know stay track and pick up on things and so forth you know so you can take breaks in between kind of like how i am taking breaks in between and recording each of these video segments where we last left off we did some updating on the carousel and put some images in so i've copied some more images over to this repository i've also made some changes to the footer and i figured it would be a little bit better to have this the same color we're going to make some additional changes to the footer though on video so that you can see those how you transition from this format to a different format without further ado we'll go ahead and get into it welcome back to the almost engineer channel if this is your first time checking out this channel please be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button below each week i come with new videos and discuss how to do technology on tuesday and how to do diy projects on saturday so if you're interested in those topics be sure to subscribe this week is a special week because it is engineering week and so as part of engineering week i am actually doing my national society of black engineers website over during this week and i'm doing it as a coding session so that hopefully you the viewer can learn something new about programming when it comes to website design or just how to code whether css html or bootstrap even so picking up where we left off i did make some changes to the footer in the previous video this was black in the background and i've changed it to the same color as the nav bar because i saw some designs that were set up that had the nav bar and this bottom footer the same color so next what i'm gonna do is actually change this from a single color layout that goes all the way across the screen to a four column layout i'm not sure how that's going to work with this banner here but we'll go ahead and convert it and then figure out the banner part at a later point so i'm going to go ahead and go down to the bottom where my footer is all right so here's the footer and in visual studio code you can actually put breakpoints here i think there's another way you can actually do a bookmark but i'm not sure how to do bookmarks in here so breakpoints help out because ebbs you wear keep track of your points in the various places in the file and what i'm going to do is actually can change this container to a we're going to go with a row and i believe that padding there and i believe that twitter class there but i'm gonna change this to a row and then on the next section i'm going to do all of that with a column of uh for anything that is a large screen or above it'll be a column of three otherwise uh calls i think it's sm will be 12 and yes so that's how i want that i'm going to remove the horizontal line and put that back and then we're going to do the same thing for the remainder of these divs and we'll also need to add an additional div and remove the footer excuse me remove the uh remove these additional containers because the parent container will address everything else that i'm doing in here and so uh so i need to put one here and i need to add one more i believe or do i have four on this page let's see so i have one two three four so i need to put this into a footer and i'll probably leave this copyright down here at the very bottom but put these links off to the side in a vertical lock if you will all right so the last item this will actually need to go into a div because it does not currently exist in one or yes it does well the whole thing doesn't so right so do a uh div here and remove that so-called intelligence from intellisense trying to figure out what i want to type all right and we'll close the existing div that's above and so that should if i remove these horizontal rows and let's see all right so that should be it let me go ahead and do the formatting on here to make sure my indentations are correct and it looks like i might be missing a div somewhere but let's go to the page and check it out just to make sure all right so everything is in a single uh well that's not in there all right um we got div container and we want this all right so we know this is the closing container i need to move this one and a corresponding div and this one with the corresponding div out of the way if you do format let's see how that lines up it does not line up for well yeah it does okay let's move this down here i think that might be correct all right so we got uh the four cards within there and they are set up correctly i know they're not centered like they should so let me do a margin of x auto hopefully that'll center there we go all right and this one is outside of the car like i say we'll address that in a little bit and then the last thing is i want to put these links up here i also need to change the anchor text for hover event to be some other kind of color or just to stay white whichever the case may be so what i'm gonna do is go ahead and copy the existing copy the existing card here and i'm gonna restructure these links here and um comment that one out do i need card text card text card text art text so actually i do need this one and i'm gonna change this to links and then card text i'm going to leave that paragraph there i'm going to copy these unordered lists and put those inside of the paragraph and well maybe not put them in a paragraph let's see how they do without being in the paragraph going to go current um that out all right so what do we have okay so we have some links over here which look good like i say this will be corrected and i actually need to remove those down at the bottom here so we'll take this entire div comment it out uh let's uncomment this one first and then i comment that or comment that rather okay so now we have what we're looking for and this footer with the copyright in it i guess that looks fine might need to change the footer up here uh class footer so it's probably something in the css i think that's what i said um in the pre in an earlier video where there was a margin yeah padding and margin at the bottom so we'll comment those two out for now and so that should be uh save it yeah so that should be closer to the bottom i think i need to run the minify okay if not that's fine all right now the next thing is to so i like this particular setup right here i may want to take this border off of the cars or put some margin in between each of these and to do that let's go back to base and i want to do a m x of 1 that's a margin on the x axis of one all right and so what i have to do is actually so when you do a column of three and you have four of them then when you try to put margin in what happens is one of those columns get kicked to the next row which is not what i want so what i'm gonna do is actually change some of these to a column of two and remember all of your columns are supposed to add up to a total of twelve so two two two well actually we'll leave that one as a four and then i'm gonna leave that one as a three and i know you're thinking 4 2 and 2 is 4 plus 4 is 8 plus 3 is 11 that is not 12. and that is correct and the reason being is because i want them to be on the same line here but also want to have possibly a little bit of margin in between and that may be a problem so i may end up having to take this margin out let's see what happens if i put padding here instead okay and padding may be the way that i end up going i i'm kind of hesitant at this point so let's take that out okay and so i have a three all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to change this last column so that column is three the amazon is four i need another one so we'll set this donations one two three and okay so that looks fine not really so three and three so three and three is six plus no yeah three and three is six plus four is ten plus 2 is 12. not sure if i want to leave it that way i may make the links a 2 and make the join today a 3 so let's give that a go so links can become a two that way all the links are in a single column and then these others are in a wider column which is fine and then i'll probably separate these links out um that's what i'm thinking maybe maybe not if you have any questions about this design drop a comment down below um i would love to hear whether you think these should be wider or narrower that's a difficult word to say narrower um but yeah especially with these because these links actually have multiple are broken across multiple lines so while i'm at it let me go ahead and change the css for these so the footer [Music] what is it something that turns red the default text is a hover event all right so we have the footer line yeah so here we go so the photo links don't need to do that so on hover i'm going to do a font weight of bold on those and so when you mouse over now they kind of jump up and i think that's better that may work for now i may change it again later on but for right now i think this does the job cool all right now this banner here i think i might just get rid of it all together and we just put something here that is slightly different um trying to find that code for that better which is so that's the page here we go we got the blocks or did i wait a minute where's the bookmark at there we go okay so and see again this is where bookmarks come handy you can just look for the bookmark you see it over here on the left but it's not so much as evident on the right as it is on the left um in some i believe is visual studio it actually will make a when you have break points on the left-hand side it will actually show them on the scroll bar as well on the right-hand side so it's a little bit easier to identify but this here only has them showing on the left so you kind of have to scroll i do believe there's an option or there may be an option you um i guess not sometimes there is an option let's see jump to breakpoint uh so you got enable audit point there you go so go to the next break point so that kind of helps uh if you're by just stepping through the code and as you see it jumps down there um so that when you're doing debugging you can utilize that all right coming back to what we were working on um so right now i'm going to [Music] so what i'm going to do is change this right now because i don't like that banner and at some point i have to log in and get the things for that banner to be able to officially do it a different way what i'm going to do is go what i am going to go ahead and do now though is to put a plain text uh banner here that represents that same piece of information for amazon and while this may not be the best way of doing it it will work now and maybe i'll take this javascript that they have as well as this iframe and give it a page by itself on the website that way the site will still blend in together but then for the amazon small it has its own page and we can refer to that page directly in our promotional items and so forth to uh that way you know people don't necessarily have to go to the site they can well they can go to the site still but then they can use that as a place to jump to a different page very quickly without having to go through multiple steps to get to it because that was one of the complaints that i had uh received about how like you got to go to our site to get to that every time and originally yeah that was the case unfortunately that's how i was set up but i there's a different way that that can be done now so amazon smile all right so there's that and if i go back to our current sites um got it all right so uh shop and i'll change this so since we have this here i can actually go back and change this to all of these to threes and or maybe even yeah so i think i can change all of these to threes and so they're equal now we'll get each of these on a line these links that is on a line by itself may even put in the bullet points as well not sure why that careers link is not showing up on the line by itself that is kind of oh well okay that makes sense because it's listing each item as an inline item which it i don't want it to now so go ahead and take those inline item text out save so now each link is being displayed there and broken the cm css board which is uh slightly inconvenient but that's fine um and i'll come back and do that one later okay so amazon smile is here i need to figure out some text to go on the amazon smile thing so i'm just going to say if you job with amazon um please consider using for your purchase and all right that fills that text in i'll go back and re-agree to define it and clarify it at a later point but that's enough to at least get started for right now and then uh i guess i can go ahead and take that page content so this right here and um well first let me uncomment it and then go ahead and copy it out and create a new page in the not the theme so we want that in the sites directory and call it um i want a separate page all right so we can do that here so i'm gonna just do it here if i think it needs to go on a separate page i might give his home page but for now this will work and there we go all right so and i think i want to put this amazon smile thing up here first granite we get more from directly from direct donations over amazon smile but i think a lot of people will be more inclined because of the fact they're using uh they're using this information to purchase then go from there and actually i'm probably going to reorder this because i want this donations text to be up here this is what we do with the donations we provide them use them into other programs so scholarships community awareness and outreach such as our engineering day at the park um yeah so go ahead and save that and [Applause] save the page itself and so if i go to the what is it donate yes go to the donate page the amazon smile thing is there got to figure out how to get rid of that white space but for right now it is fine since i am still testing things out i'm not too alarmed about it but long term this will move up or we even have a different banner here going back to the amazon smile thing let's go and in the base need to add where is that link um so amazon smile so just copy what they have here and and so this particular set of text was provided from the template so i'm just copy that and do donate with a pound sign of amazon smile in here and that will all right so with that this will take you to the donate page as well as jump down to this section of the page so to demonstrate that let's go back to the homepage and scroll down past all this text and hit shop today and there we go we jump down to the bottom where it says amazon smile all right next let's go and fix the css for the links over here on the right hand side so that will be in the what i take out the left nav item list item i think that was this you know footer yeah so i took out this class but that should address that problem i think okay so it is bolding so i need to do also um the ul footer i don't need the hover event i need the other pieces of the event here we go all right so now my links are again white so that's what i want next i need to go back and fix the links at the top part of the page that have this class this class needs to be removed is there a more efficient way of doing this yes you can do find and replace and in that find and replace you can do [Music] for it to search only the selection and then do a find and replace based on that selection um but i didn't do that in this particular scenario as you saw uh it's not that many items and sometimes crafting that uh find and replace expression it takes a little bit longer than just going through and doing each line that way all right so we have our bottom section here of our top section there and there we go all right any point i could change this to black but i chose to go with the red it seems to be a little bit more of a subtle color and i may even just change this back to black though who knows all right so we have all of that there let me go ahead and change these to buttons i think it would give a better visual appearance if they were buttons so we just do a btn on the not that that's the wrong button a button as far as each of those because it i think it will look better that way but if it doesn't um it can easily be undone if you think it would look better with buttons feel free to drop a comment to say yes or no and in addition to the buttons i need to also do a class that corresponds to said buttons because i want the buttons to stand out and so if i have let's say btn and then btn footer there we go and then we'll do another class btn footer with a background color that is black and text color that is white semicolon all right and i need a border around this thing so border with um gotta type it right we'll go with uh 1px and order color and we'll do black save all right so we got that and then there's another thing i thought it was the background color but i guess it's not um let's see if i can do this so btn dark let's see what happens uh oh okay so on mouse over it's working not quite want it to look like this without having to be moused over and so let me see what other attributes it is setting bottom border which is fine left border top color i don't know what's doing so how about this let's disable the css for the moment and see how it looks once it or if it'll refresh all right so button start okay so it does that right now if i wanted it so the background color is dark red i think that's because the css for that is telling it to be that way overwriting it's not an inline style but if i do an inline style it would overwrite so i need um btn footer uh yeah let's just stick with btn footer re-enable that and yeah there we go i want the text to still be white so i have a hover event that is changing that text to black not sure where is that on hover on hover on hover vtn homepage so we got a black with a body div dope footer footer photo photo sub footer um the background color is dark red ah so here we go i think that does that have cart link on it yes it does all right so let's take this out and see what happens once it okay so stop today has btn and btn footer um and the footer is defaulting to white well that's just a general um [Music] all right so let's do inspect element on this item we got div card body let's see if there's a card body in here spelling helps no okay so the styles that is inheriting so you gotta border background color i want the background color to be uh if we can change that one two three all right so a b t n i'm trying to see where is btn ah there we go all right so black text is white there we go now on hover or a um and i may have to narrow this down a little bit because that is not doing exactly how i want all right so btn footer so let's do a dot btn dot footer all right and change this abtn back to dark red and save okay and so now that is more specific to what will show up here and this and that's what i want all right so coming back to the base uh template going to change all the class cards or class excuse me change the class on all of the links over to btn btn footer and that's what we want we want these buttons to kind of or we want the links to appear as buttons and that they stand out and so when click they still go there which is cool all right so close the dev console and make sure all the links are working as it should be which they are um maybe want to add a little bit of flair to that where here so let's do a card title so we can extend the card title i don't think there's one already in here title no good all right so we do card title and div dot card title with a text uh decoration of underline and it did not do what i thought it was going to do all right so what other classes do we need to add to make this possible so i did a div i don't think i need to do a div let's come back so there's really a h5 not a div that explains why that didn't work all right and so now we have that there and i really don't want that just on that part so i may go with a border bottom of 1px or 3px and then border style of solid all right and um border bottom style i'll play that century there we go and so now we have our length uh line that goes all the way across the bottom here and um i would say that's pretty decent for the bottom um close dev console i may want to let's get rid of this border that is around the card so coming back to the css i want to do card and set the order width to zero so i'm going to do div dot card border width width spelling okay 0px and save all right and so now we have cards for each of these as you see there is no border here and if you really can't see i'll zoom in so now you see there's no border also when we get to a certain size that the divs go from side by side to stacked on top of each other which is the behavior that we want all right and i'm probably going to put another i put a horizontal rule down here at the very bottom to separate the bottom of the page that copyright information out so come back here and the copyright information is down here so we want a let's just do a hr i could do a border in in that div but hr should be sufficient hr by the way stands for horizontal rule and that needs a class with a background color of white all right and so there you see we have that stretched all the way across and so we are good to go on that aspect of things okay next step or next item i have some pictures brought in and they are sitting waiting to be leveraged so what i want to do is to fill some of these pages such as the membership page that i was on previously up with some content and to also work on some of the other pages i think i had a scholarships page yes and so i'm going to put the picture that we have from previous scholarship years up so that people i guess you could say no that is real and they can see some of the scholarship recipients and i'm not sure which photo is which um i could actually pull up these images in visual studio code if we do a refresh on that directory and here we go all right so and i loaded several images in here because i want to be able to do this so this is one of the community programs that we did we had a number of people here myself back here in the very back and of course my traffic light all the way up here in the front on display um so i'm not sure which of these may use let's see when load the image that's convenient uh that's myself with some other gentlemen who are also in nsbe or where at least when they were in college all right so we'll go with this particular photo here and so this will be a community outreach photo and if you go to programs i want to put this photo on the top of this page so from the previous video we talked about uh having alts yeah having things that uh images on here and using that in the metadata uh photo with participants t-i-c-i-p-a-n-t-s all right so we come back to the programs page so i should have okay so i have a bad link here that's not what i wanted oh images is plural save all right and so what i'm gonna have to do is to go to my css and i'm gonna ultimately have to resize this image because as you see it is super large um it was that's the original file so i'm gonna have to resize this for the web but as a quick and dirty way of doing this uh what i'm going to do is to want to create a uh class some create a class for image and we call uh head image all right and we'll save that and then we'll come back over to the css file and do dot uh head image age parentheses and do a width of um let's say 100 i think that's what it's supposed to be and height of auto i think that's how you would get that to resize yes so what will happen is what it's doing now because i put this css here is that it's saying take 100 of the width of the page i mean excuse me 100 of the parent container and then the height being auto means that this image will resize itself to fit that same space so for instance let's say the width of the screen is 500 pixels and so it will resize the height based upon that and so when you resize it like this right here to that nine through the smaller space the image will automatically resize and will not get cut off that's how you avoid getting that right hand scroll bar now ultimately i'm gonna resize this again so that it's not as high resolution because if we do the image info this is 4 000 by 2 000 approximately pixels which is a pretty large file for the web and as you see is scaled down to 1080 by 608 all right so um just keep that in mind but i wanted this particular photo here because it does relate to some of the community outreach programs that we do and the participation that we've had in doing some of the things that we do here um so now that i've got that one there we'll come back over here to the abouts and that's kind of scaled incorrectly too and i maybe i may have to just do this one individually and when it comes to scaling uh these particular set of images and uh maybe there's a different way of doing that so i auto maybe i'll just do height auto and with auto and let's see what happens then all right so that resizes itself accordingly this one is still too large there's a way to do it so that it fits um so actually come think of it so let's do a max width of 100 that's what i'm thinking and so that will fit there and then if we go back to the about there we go so that resized accordingly to the way it should be so that way you don't have these ultra large images stretching beyond the screen and so again max width will make sure that it doesn't extend beyond the container that it's in and this is in particular two images so what i really can do is actually do image img dot head image so that i know that that's specific to images all right um coming over to the membership page i do have another photo that i would like to use and the goal is to not use the same set of photos over and over again um and then the ones i do not need i will take out uh let's see okay that's a lot of the same photo all right so here's one that we do for our toy donation that we do all right so this one is the one that i want to do for the scholarship so because this is the scholarship banquet that we had some years ago and let's go back to let's go to the scholarship page and then we'll put in image url of slash images with the file name and i notice this is uppercase so let me fix that right quick because while some sys like if you're your server if your website is hosted on a windows space system it will not make a big deal if that file name is uppercase or lowercase but on a linux based system it will make all of the world of difference if that is not done correctly all right so the image alternate tab tag rather is the scholarship recipients um scholarship recipient spell check does not help that's the thing s-c-h-o-l-a-r all right so that's there all right so now if we come back to [Music] if we go to scholarship so we go to programs and scholarship boom we have an image that is fairly again fairly large but it can be resized a little bit better i can actually set the max width so let me go to the css i'm going to set the max width to 75 with the height of auto and so that's a little bit more realistic and where it should be i mean you can even go down even further to as fifty percent of the max width of the screen of that transparent container and to get this a little bit smaller but i'm okay with 75 percent depending on some of the other images i may need to adjust it accordingly and this is kind of similar as well as far as that percentage goes alright so that photo looks great and i need one for the membership i think i have enough uh photos six eight i use that there uh three six one that's a different one okay so maybe i need to go copy a few more photos because i think i might be missing some from somewhere all right uh yeah so go back to programs right quick and we do have some engineering photos i think i actually downloaded some hold on i did download some here i believe this is one i just need to copy it over okay so there we go all right so this is another one i actually just need to move them over to the appropriate directory because i forgot about those so copy and open containing folder because easier to go back alright copy images paste there we go all right so now that we have those two images in here we can come back over here and refresh and make sure that they work so use this path um that's a very long file name that's what happens when you download images from that particular social media site that starts with f i'm not gonna call the name because they may be listening but we can rename that at a later time uh let's see we have membership programs scholarship engineering day ah okay so what i want to do i need to go find a few more images but what i want to do is also add some images to this carousel which is what i previously mentioned in the last video so we'll come back up to the carousel and i need to get this image off the clipboard so i don't erase it all right so i'm just going to copy a carousel item well before i do that let me go up here and i'm gonna add some slides so i got zero one two three and four all right and yes that's good all right so we got a div and we need to go from that div to i believe is this one or the next the next one okay i think that's correct save all right and we'll run well probably don't want to run the formatting on it just yet all right so copy that and i'm going to remove that paste and i'm going to check to make sure it didn't break anything in process okay so the image is there and i got a couple of i got one more or two more that probably want to drop in so that's that one that is a i guess i can use this one on the membership page granted all the people in that particular photo are not members but majority of the people in that photo are members so image url and do slash images slash that dot jpg and image alt um uh members uh that's all right so there goes that and so if you have that here boom so cool for as the images go [Music] all right that needs to really be a h3 tag so since i'm here change that to an h3 uh all right now back to the carousel i think i had a cup one more or two more photos not that one this one yes all right so we'll put uh that down here and then there's another photo that's it [Music] yeah that's it so we'll go with this one and put that one down here as well and we come back to the carousel item and scroll down to the div there copy paste and paste and we'll take this file here paste it there and take this one here and paste it there and save and now i think i have all of the carousel items correct all right so like a mist type the jpg is it lowercase jpg and so this is what i was talking about when you go and do file names and the file names are either lowercase or uppercase and they don't quite match that you have that problem looks like the url is correct 12 54 17 jpg saying that the file might be corrupt which is weird um because it just got through showing it so i'm not sure how it's coming to the conclusion that is corrupt all right so that's what i copied that one works that was worse okay um so save again and see images images got it all right so scroll through scroll through woo that is massively large and then that one doesn't work okay how convenient all right so the width is auto and the height is 100 uh percent of the parent and looks like i'm missing the image all right so we got how many so let's collapse okay i don't want to collapse that one two three four five six okay so i got one too many images up here let me take this last one out and save so i got one two three four five and the number of images you have needs to correspond to the number of indicators on your carousel otherwise you're going to get a carousel image that doesn't have well it's going to scroll to the carousel item that doesn't have a corresponding image which will be a problem uh looks like i might be missing a something on a div somewhere not fully sure all right so let's take one of these out see i think that's correct all right so if i do that and three four and it should glitch which it's doing that's fine with me all right so this image i probably don't maybe i don't need to use that particular image um all right so let's put that there well that's the same fault how convenient 5459 okay so let's try this one instead all right and with that there that should work carousel next and first okay okay there we go all right so one two three four five i think this because this image is so large it's not really sure how to handle it which i don't quite agree with why it's not sure with how to handle it um so let's do this let's take well that styling probably doesn't need to be in line i think i need to put a class there instead so let me do a style on this last one so let's do a style uh but that's not going like that can i do that nope doesn't like it got it all right so we'll just cut it put it on the line by itself comment and then do a class of head image it's what i use technically i'm not trying to use this on this line but trying to see if it will actually make a difference and make this fit or not and it doesn't look like it will make it fit um which is fairly weird that it wouldn't want to fit there so let's uh we'll go ahead and do style equal width of 100 percent and heights is auto for this and see what happens with that particular image okay so it's a little bit better uh than what it was before still not scaling the way that i would like it to 75 on that one and see what happens a little bit i'm not sure why still trying to scale because it's supposed to scale to let's take this one out it's supposed to scale to the parent container which is still not there okay and i might just have to just ultimately resize this image all together to 50. all right go back okay so now i have the whole image but i'm not sure why it's not trying to fit to this container here um usually that doesn't happen or at least in my experience it doesn't happen but uh yeah there's that at least it is scrolling all of the other images and they're fitting for the most part let's view this image so okay so the bottom part of this one is also being cut off i didn't realize that um so if we go back so you see here the desk and the floor are not seen in this part and i may need to make some alignment adjustments to this particular photo so i'm actually probably going to do a text was it text line center on that one and see if it moves it up or not okay so it didn't move it up a little bit tricky to deal with but uh yeah we'll go with that for now and so actually i did the wrong image or did i okay so we're going to change i think i did do the wrong image and yeah so let's trace this to about 60 of the width and height auto and if we come back so 60 percent is still within reason for that so all of the images are now looking fairly good in my opinion okay that being said i'm going to do some cleanup here so don't need these h1s anymore worst case scenario go back and copy them out of their respective templates so i'm going to leave that div there in case some text does need to be put in in the future but as you see right now i really don't need that all right so there's that there's that whoops three and all right and i know i mentioned in a previous video that sometimes i leave code in like commented out until the very end as i just absolutely certain that i'm not going to use it but this i know i'm not going to use so i'm just going to go ahead and remove all of this out so again at any point that you're watching this video you know or even after you get done watching this video feel free to drop any comments that you may have or any questions about how i am doing things in here and so once you remove all your comedy code make sure you haven't broken anything in a process because yes while the code is commented out sometimes you actually can break stuff in the process and that's not a good thing so all right so we have our images up here at the top and we have membership has a photo programs as a photo the events pops to another site photos i probably get another image there and then we have this uh city image here and we're going to get officers listed as well as their positions i'm going to do that later i may or may not do that particular part on camera so continuing on the next item i want to work on is the home page so what i did was look at some of the other chapters websites and they do have the these header items here that i commented out so i'm just going to go ahead and restore this particular set of items and go ahead and fill it in so let me go ahead and format this section here or format the document um it may have formatted the entire section though and i think i don't have a corresponding item all right so and i have a container at the top i believe no i don't so um [Music] so this does not need to be in the co well yes it does okay so i only want these heading i guess they call them featurettes or something of that nature you only want those on the home page so i'm going to extend my if condition for my carousel the image thing that at the top of the home page so this thing here is called the carousel so i'm going to extend that or loop include this part of the uh header thing to only show when this down here is not showing as well and [Music] then yeah we'll leave it at that and so for the page body of the index home page i don't need any content so what i'm going to do is to say adios to everything in here delete save and so all of this text down here the bottom should disappear which it has and then all i have now is the headings that are hardcoded into the page which is what i want all right so let's do another formatting of the document to make sure everything is in alignment and it looks like it may or may not be i think i actually don't have i need a closing div for that container slash div all right and so now i have to do a format i think that's correct now yes and all right so i want to highlight certain aspects of the website in this heading section and to do that i'm just going to pick out various things so one of our signature programs is engineering in the park we call it e day at the park all right so i typed that in and looking at it making sure that it actually fits in this space looks good the other thing i want to do is ask people to join so that will be the left block and then on the right hand side i think i'm going to go with programs all right and there we go so we have drawing either at the park and programs should be plural not singular looks like we might have caught it there we go all right and so next we'll have the links so this will go to the programs page plural this will go to the eday page and this will go to the membership page and we'll need to put the leading slash on there all right and so if we test these out they go to the membership page which is correct go to the e-day page which is correct and goes to the program page which is also correct and then i got to figure out some text to drop in i may just do like some preview text so we already have some text here i may just take this copy it and for this particular paragraph drop that in paste and obviously it doesn't like that long line format and let it wrap on its own and there you have it for yes so whoops no not down here here we go right here all right and so i'm gonna put a end container tag of uh and headings and that way as i scroll through this template because this template is fairly long um it's 450 lines exact and that is because of some of the comments are still in here and so forth but i still want to be able to scroll through and be able to find like the beginning and ending of the divs and not have to be like tracing like i've kind of been doing as you've seen me do so this is a little bit easier way just to put a comment there at the end of it and the same thing with like your closing conditions so like for instance at the top of this file here i have several uh conditions here so like this one so for instance this meta tag so at the end of this one i could actually do this in title condition or something like that nature and that helps you be able to find uh that in the file so when you're scrolling through you know if you have five or ten conditions in there that you're looking for it helps you find that ending fairly quickly so you know where to start from and where to scroll back up to all right so i did that for that one let's copy the text for engineering date at the park and i'm gonna just put this here at some point i probably will go back and refine this set of text not while on camera though uh because you know sometimes you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to put here and it's still not come out right all right so and i like when i have paragraphs i like the text in the paragraph to be on its own line that way when i start if i were to add like classes those classes could take up this entire line you know depending on how many you put in here i know some people they rather have their paragraph as concise as possible but i am not necessarily that way readability of the code is more important to me than being concise but there are different schools of thought on that so think about it as you may all right so for this last thing uh we'll go ahead and copy and paste and i'm actually have to change the text i don't know if you actually read it before i saw complete all of these steps listed on the membership page all right and so if you come back here to the home page now all right so we have joined asby we have programs and i'm gonna like i say redef refine these paragraphs here um and also try to make a little bit more even than what they currently are and there's that okay and so uh yeah this is coming out pretty well i did not need to click that page all right so so far so good like i say depending on the feedback i get from the other members in the chapter this color scheme may change as it stands right now i'm sticking with this dark red but it may change to black um at you know a later point so if you're checking this at some point in the future after this video has already been released just know that it may change from the way it looks now and so when you look at it don't be like hey he's got red in the video but black in actuality or green in actuality and that is probably going to be the reason why so just keep that in mind all right so that will wrap things up for this video series um as you see i've taken if you have not seen the other videos in the series a link will be in the description below uh starting from the beginning to the end this you know has been a very week uh education for me because uh in some of the other videos i actually learned how to do things myself for some of the css items that i was not familiar with so it's kind of surprising but you know as i'm teaching others the good thing about it is when you teach others you also learn something yourself um so you're able to even further that advancement of the knowledge that you have to other people so any questions drop those down in the comments section below if you have learned anything from this video series i ask that you please give this video and the other videos in the series a thumbs up if you have any questions comments if you don't want to put your question in a comment shoot me a message on instagram or twitter at almost engr the handle is up in the upper right of your screen i do respond to messages that i receive i do reply back to the comments that are posted so it may take some time for me to do it but i do see it and i do respond alright until next time peace out and

back i am continuing the process of the update on the website and i know you're probably thinking like how many parts this is going to be well it's going to be a is it it may end up being a lot of parts and the reason being because i want you to be able to watch this in smaller segments instead of trying to do the entire project in one large long video um that way it's easier to you know stay track and pick up on things and so forth you know so you can take breaks in between kind of like how i am taking breaks in between and recording each of these video segments where we last left off we did some updating on the carousel and put some images in so i've copied some more images over to this repository i've also made some changes to the footer and i figured it would be a little bit better to have this the same color we're going to make some additional changes to the footer though on video so that you can see those how you transition from this format to a different format without further ado we'll go ahead and get into it welcome back to the almost engineer channel if this is your first time checking out this channel please be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button below each week i come with new videos and discuss how to do technology on tuesday and how to do diy projects on saturday so if you're interested in those topics be sure to subscribe this week is a special week because it is engineering week and so as part of engineering week i am actually doing my national society of black engineers website over during this week and i'm doing it as a coding session so that hopefully you the viewer can learn something new about programming when it comes to website design or just how to code whether css html or bootstrap even so picking up where we left off i did make some changes to the footer in the previous video this was black in the background and i've changed it to the same color as the nav bar because i saw some designs that were set up that had the nav bar and this bottom footer the same color so next what i'm gonna do is actually change this from a single color layout that goes all the way across the screen to a four column layout i'm not sure how that's going to work with this banner here but we'll go ahead and convert it and then figure out the banner part at a later point so i'm going to go ahead and go down to the bottom where my footer is all right so here's the footer and in visual studio code you can actually put breakpoints here i think there's another way you can actually do a bookmark but i'm not sure how to do bookmarks in here so breakpoints help out because ebbs you wear keep track of your points in the various places in the file and what i'm going to do is actually can change this container to a we're going to go with a row and i believe that padding there and i believe that twitter class there but i'm gonna change this to a row and then on the next section i'm going to do all of that with a column of uh for anything that is a large screen or above it'll be a column of three otherwise uh calls i think it's sm will be 12 and yes so that's how i want that i'm going to remove the horizontal line and put that back and then we're going to do the same thing for the remainder of these divs and we'll also need to add an additional div and remove the footer excuse me remove the uh remove these additional containers because the parent container will address everything else that i'm doing in here and so uh so i need to put one here and i need to add one more i believe or do i have four on this page let's see so i have one two three four so i need to put this into a footer and i'll probably leave this copyright down here at the very bottom but put these links off to the side in a vertical lock if you will all right so the last item this will actually need to go into a div because it does not currently exist in one or yes it does well the whole thing doesn't so right so do a uh div here and remove that so-called intelligence from intellisense trying to figure out what i want to type all right and we'll close the existing div that's above and so that should if i remove these horizontal rows and let's see all right so that should be it let me go ahead and do the formatting on here to make sure my indentations are correct and it looks like i might be missing a div somewhere but let's go to the page and check it out just to make sure all right so everything is in a single uh well that's not in there all right um we got div container and we want this all right so we know this is the closing container i need to move this one and a corresponding div and this one with the corresponding div out of the way if you do format let's see how that lines up it does not line up for well yeah it does okay let's move this down here i think that might be correct all right so we got uh the four cards within there and they are set up correctly i know they're not centered like they should so let me do a margin of x auto hopefully that'll center there we go all right and this one is outside of the car like i say we'll address that in a little bit and then the last thing is i want to put these links up here i also need to change the anchor text for hover event to be some other kind of color or just to stay white whichever the case may be so what i'm gonna do is go ahead and copy the existing copy the existing card here and i'm gonna restructure these links here and um comment that one out do i need card text card text card text art text so actually i do need this one and i'm gonna change this to links and then card text i'm going to leave that paragraph there i'm going to copy these unordered lists and put those inside of the paragraph and well maybe not put them in a paragraph let's see how they do without being in the paragraph going to go current um that out all right so what do we have okay so we have some links over here which look good like i say this will be corrected and i actually need to remove those down at the bottom here so we'll take this entire div comment it out uh let's uncomment this one first and then i comment that or comment that rather okay so now we have what we're looking for and this footer with the copyright in it i guess that looks fine might need to change the footer up here uh class footer so it's probably something in the css i think that's what i said um in the pre in an earlier video where there was a margin yeah padding and margin at the bottom so we'll comment those two out for now and so that should be uh save it yeah so that should be closer to the bottom i think i need to run the minify okay if not that's fine all right now the next thing is to so i like this particular setup right here i may want to take this border off of the cars or put some margin in between each of these and to do that let's go back to base and i want to do a m x of 1 that's a margin on the x axis of one all right and so what i have to do is actually so when you do a column of three and you have four of them then when you try to put margin in what happens is one of those columns get kicked to the next row which is not what i want so what i'm gonna do is actually change some of these to a column of two and remember all of your columns are supposed to add up to a total of twelve so two two two well actually we'll leave that one as a four and then i'm gonna leave that one as a three and i know you're thinking 4 2 and 2 is 4 plus 4 is 8 plus 3 is 11 that is not 12. and that is correct and the reason being is because i want them to be on the same line here but also want to have possibly a little bit of margin in between and that may be a problem so i may end up having to take this margin out let's see what happens if i put padding here instead okay and padding may be the way that i end up going i i'm kind of hesitant at this point so let's take that out okay and so i have a three all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to change this last column so that column is three the amazon is four i need another one so we'll set this donations one two three and okay so that looks fine not really so three and three so three and three is six plus no yeah three and three is six plus four is ten plus 2 is 12. not sure if i want to leave it that way i may make the links a 2 and make the join today a 3 so let's give that a go so links can become a two that way all the links are in a single column and then these others are in a wider column which is fine and then i'll probably separate these links out um that's what i'm thinking maybe maybe not if you have any questions about this design drop a comment down below um i would love to hear whether you think these should be wider or narrower that's a difficult word to say narrower um but yeah especially with these because these links actually have multiple are broken across multiple lines so while i'm at it let me go ahead and change the css for these so the footer [Music] what is it something that turns red the default text is a hover event all right so we have the footer line yeah so here we go so the photo links don't need to do that so on hover i'm going to do a font weight of bold on those and so when you mouse over now they kind of jump up and i think that's better that may work for now i may change it again later on but for right now i think this does the job cool all right now this banner here i think i might just get rid of it all together and we just put something here that is slightly different um trying to find that code for that better which is so that's the page here we go we got the blocks or did i wait a minute where's the bookmark at there we go okay so and see again this is where bookmarks come handy you can just look for the bookmark you see it over here on the left but it's not so much as evident on the right as it is on the left um in some i believe is visual studio it actually will make a when you have break points on the left-hand side it will actually show them on the scroll bar as well on the right-hand side so it's a little bit easier to identify but this here only has them showing on the left so you kind of have to scroll i do believe there's an option or there may be an option you um i guess not sometimes there is an option let's see jump to breakpoint uh so you got enable audit point there you go so go to the next break point so that kind of helps uh if you're by just stepping through the code and as you see it jumps down there um so that when you're doing debugging you can utilize that all right coming back to what we were working on um so right now i'm going to [Music] so what i'm going to do is change this right now because i don't like that banner and at some point i have to log in and get the things for that banner to be able to officially do it a different way what i'm going to do is go what i am going to go ahead and do now though is to put a plain text uh banner here that represents that same piece of information for amazon and while this may not be the best way of doing it it will work now and maybe i'll take this javascript that they have as well as this iframe and give it a page by itself on the website that way the site will still blend in together but then for the amazon small it has its own page and we can refer to that page directly in our promotional items and so forth to uh that way you know people don't necessarily have to go to the site they can well they can go to the site still but then they can use that as a place to jump to a different page very quickly without having to go through multiple steps to get to it because that was one of the complaints that i had uh received about how like you got to go to our site to get to that every time and originally yeah that was the case unfortunately that's how i was set up but i there's a different way that that can be done now so amazon smile all right so there's that and if i go back to our current sites um got it all right so uh shop and i'll change this so since we have this here i can actually go back and change this to all of these to threes and or maybe even yeah so i think i can change all of these to threes and so they're equal now we'll get each of these on a line these links that is on a line by itself may even put in the bullet points as well not sure why that careers link is not showing up on the line by itself that is kind of oh well okay that makes sense because it's listing each item as an inline item which it i don't want it to now so go ahead and take those inline item text out save so now each link is being displayed there and broken the cm css board which is uh slightly inconvenient but that's fine um and i'll come back and do that one later okay so amazon smile is here i need to figure out some text to go on the amazon smile thing so i'm just going to say if you job with amazon um please consider using for your purchase and all right that fills that text in i'll go back and re-agree to define it and clarify it at a later point but that's enough to at least get started for right now and then uh i guess i can go ahead and take that page content so this right here and um well first let me uncomment it and then go ahead and copy it out and create a new page in the not the theme so we want that in the sites directory and call it um i want a separate page all right so we can do that here so i'm gonna just do it here if i think it needs to go on a separate page i might give his home page but for now this will work and there we go all right so and i think i want to put this amazon smile thing up here first granite we get more from directly from direct donations over amazon smile but i think a lot of people will be more inclined because of the fact they're using uh they're using this information to purchase then go from there and actually i'm probably going to reorder this because i want this donations text to be up here this is what we do with the donations we provide them use them into other programs so scholarships community awareness and outreach such as our engineering day at the park um yeah so go ahead and save that and [Applause] save the page itself and so if i go to the what is it donate yes go to the donate page the amazon smile thing is there got to figure out how to get rid of that white space but for right now it is fine since i am still testing things out i'm not too alarmed about it but long term this will move up or we even have a different banner here going back to the amazon smile thing let's go and in the base need to add where is that link um so amazon smile so just copy what they have here and and so this particular set of text was provided from the template so i'm just copy that and do donate with a pound sign of amazon smile in here and that will all right so with that this will take you to the donate page as well as jump down to this section of the page so to demonstrate that let's go back to the homepage and scroll down past all this text and hit shop today and there we go we jump down to the bottom where it says amazon smile all right next let's go and fix the css for the links over here on the right hand side so that will be in the what i take out the left nav item list item i think that was this you know footer yeah so i took out this class but that should address that problem i think okay so it is bolding so i need to do also um the ul footer i don't need the hover event i need the other pieces of the event here we go all right so now my links are again white so that's what i want next i need to go back and fix the links at the top part of the page that have this class this class needs to be removed is there a more efficient way of doing this yes you can do find and replace and in that find and replace you can do [Music] for it to search only the selection and then do a find and replace based on that selection um but i didn't do that in this particular scenario as you saw uh it's not that many items and sometimes crafting that uh find and replace expression it takes a little bit longer than just going through and doing each line that way all right so we have our bottom section here of our top section there and there we go all right any point i could change this to black but i chose to go with the red it seems to be a little bit more of a subtle color and i may even just change this back to black though who knows all right so we have all of that there let me go ahead and change these to buttons i think it would give a better visual appearance if they were buttons so we just do a btn on the not that that's the wrong button a button as far as each of those because it i think it will look better that way but if it doesn't um it can easily be undone if you think it would look better with buttons feel free to drop a comment to say yes or no and in addition to the buttons i need to also do a class that corresponds to said buttons because i want the buttons to stand out and so if i have let's say btn and then btn footer there we go and then we'll do another class btn footer with a background color that is black and text color that is white semicolon all right and i need a border around this thing so border with um gotta type it right we'll go with uh 1px and order color and we'll do black save all right so we got that and then there's another thing i thought it was the background color but i guess it's not um let's see if i can do this so btn dark let's see what happens uh oh okay so on mouse over it's working not quite want it to look like this without having to be moused over and so let me see what other attributes it is setting bottom border which is fine left border top color i don't know what's doing so how about this let's disable the css for the moment and see how it looks once it or if it'll refresh all right so button start okay so it does that right now if i wanted it so the background color is dark red i think that's because the css for that is telling it to be that way overwriting it's not an inline style but if i do an inline style it would overwrite so i need um btn footer uh yeah let's just stick with btn footer re-enable that and yeah there we go i want the text to still be white so i have a hover event that is changing that text to black not sure where is that on hover on hover on hover vtn homepage so we got a black with a body div dope footer footer photo photo sub footer um the background color is dark red ah so here we go i think that does that have cart link on it yes it does all right so let's take this out and see what happens once it okay so stop today has btn and btn footer um and the footer is defaulting to white well that's just a general um [Music] all right so let's do inspect element on this item we got div card body let's see if there's a card body in here spelling helps no okay so the styles that is inheriting so you gotta border background color i want the background color to be uh if we can change that one two three all right so a b t n i'm trying to see where is btn ah there we go all right so black text is white there we go now on hover or a um and i may have to narrow this down a little bit because that is not doing exactly how i want all right so btn footer so let's do a dot btn dot footer all right and change this abtn back to dark red and save okay and so now that is more specific to what will show up here and this and that's what i want all right so coming back to the base uh template going to change all the class cards or class excuse me change the class on all of the links over to btn btn footer and that's what we want we want these buttons to kind of or we want the links to appear as buttons and that they stand out and so when click they still go there which is cool all right so close the dev console and make sure all the links are working as it should be which they are um maybe want to add a little bit of flair to that where here so let's do a card title so we can extend the card title i don't think there's one already in here title no good all right so we do card title and div dot card title with a text uh decoration of underline and it did not do what i thought it was going to do all right so what other classes do we need to add to make this possible so i did a div i don't think i need to do a div let's come back so there's really a h5 not a div that explains why that didn't work all right and so now we have that there and i really don't want that just on that part so i may go with a border bottom of 1px or 3px and then border style of solid all right and um border bottom style i'll play that century there we go and so now we have our length uh line that goes all the way across the bottom here and um i would say that's pretty decent for the bottom um close dev console i may want to let's get rid of this border that is around the card so coming back to the css i want to do card and set the order width to zero so i'm going to do div dot card border width width spelling okay 0px and save all right and so now we have cards for each of these as you see there is no border here and if you really can't see i'll zoom in so now you see there's no border also when we get to a certain size that the divs go from side by side to stacked on top of each other which is the behavior that we want all right and i'm probably going to put another i put a horizontal rule down here at the very bottom to separate the bottom of the page that copyright information out so come back here and the copyright information is down here so we want a let's just do a hr i could do a border in in that div but hr should be sufficient hr by the way stands for horizontal rule and that needs a class with a background color of white all right and so there you see we have that stretched all the way across and so we are good to go on that aspect of things okay next step or next item i have some pictures brought in and they are sitting waiting to be leveraged so what i want to do is to fill some of these pages such as the membership page that i was on previously up with some content and to also work on some of the other pages i think i had a scholarships page yes and so i'm going to put the picture that we have from previous scholarship years up so that people i guess you could say no that is real and they can see some of the scholarship recipients and i'm not sure which photo is which um i could actually pull up these images in visual studio code if we do a refresh on that directory and here we go all right so and i loaded several images in here because i want to be able to do this so this is one of the community programs that we did we had a number of people here myself back here in the very back and of course my traffic light all the way up here in the front on display um so i'm not sure which of these may use let's see when load the image that's convenient uh that's myself with some other gentlemen who are also in nsbe or where at least when they were in college all right so we'll go with this particular photo here and so this will be a community outreach photo and if you go to programs i want to put this photo on the top of this page so from the previous video we talked about uh having alts yeah having things that uh images on here and using that in the metadata uh photo with participants t-i-c-i-p-a-n-t-s all right so we come back to the programs page so i should have okay so i have a bad link here that's not what i wanted oh images is plural save all right and so what i'm gonna have to do is to go to my css and i'm gonna ultimately have to resize this image because as you see it is super large um it was that's the original file so i'm gonna have to resize this for the web but as a quick and dirty way of doing this uh what i'm going to do is to want to create a uh class some create a class for image and we call uh head image all right and we'll save that and then we'll come back over to the css file and do dot uh head image age parentheses and do a width of um let's say 100 i think that's what it's supposed to be and height of auto i think that's how you would get that to resize yes so what will happen is what it's doing now because i put this css here is that it's saying take 100 of the width of the page i mean excuse me 100 of the parent container and then the height being auto means that this image will resize itself to fit that same space so for instance let's say the width of the screen is 500 pixels and so it will resize the height based upon that and so when you resize it like this right here to that nine through the smaller space the image will automatically resize and will not get cut off that's how you avoid getting that right hand scroll bar now ultimately i'm gonna resize this again so that it's not as high resolution because if we do the image info this is 4 000 by 2 000 approximately pixels which is a pretty large file for the web and as you see is scaled down to 1080 by 608 all right so um just keep that in mind but i wanted this particular photo here because it does relate to some of the community outreach programs that we do and the participation that we've had in doing some of the things that we do here um so now that i've got that one there we'll come back over here to the abouts and that's kind of scaled incorrectly too and i maybe i may have to just do this one individually and when it comes to scaling uh these particular set of images and uh maybe there's a different way of doing that so i auto maybe i'll just do height auto and with auto and let's see what happens then all right so that resizes itself accordingly this one is still too large there's a way to do it so that it fits um so actually come think of it so let's do a max width of 100 that's what i'm thinking and so that will fit there and then if we go back to the about there we go so that resized accordingly to the way it should be so that way you don't have these ultra large images stretching beyond the screen and so again max width will make sure that it doesn't extend beyond the container that it's in and this is in particular two images so what i really can do is actually do image img dot head image so that i know that that's specific to images all right um coming over to the membership page i do have another photo that i would like to use and the goal is to not use the same set of photos over and over again um and then the ones i do not need i will take out uh let's see okay that's a lot of the same photo all right so here's one that we do for our toy donation that we do all right so this one is the one that i want to do for the scholarship so because this is the scholarship banquet that we had some years ago and let's go back to let's go to the scholarship page and then we'll put in image url of slash images with the file name and i notice this is uppercase so let me fix that right quick because while some sys like if you're your server if your website is hosted on a windows space system it will not make a big deal if that file name is uppercase or lowercase but on a linux based system it will make all of the world of difference if that is not done correctly all right so the image alternate tab tag rather is the scholarship recipients um scholarship recipient spell check does not help that's the thing s-c-h-o-l-a-r all right so that's there all right so now if we come back to [Music] if we go to scholarship so we go to programs and scholarship boom we have an image that is fairly again fairly large but it can be resized a little bit better i can actually set the max width so let me go to the css i'm going to set the max width to 75 with the height of auto and so that's a little bit more realistic and where it should be i mean you can even go down even further to as fifty percent of the max width of the screen of that transparent container and to get this a little bit smaller but i'm okay with 75 percent depending on some of the other images i may need to adjust it accordingly and this is kind of similar as well as far as that percentage goes alright so that photo looks great and i need one for the membership i think i have enough uh photos six eight i use that there uh three six one that's a different one okay so maybe i need to go copy a few more photos because i think i might be missing some from somewhere all right uh yeah so go back to programs right quick and we do have some engineering photos i think i actually downloaded some hold on i did download some here i believe this is one i just need to copy it over okay so there we go all right so this is another one i actually just need to move them over to the appropriate directory because i forgot about those so copy and open containing folder because easier to go back alright copy images paste there we go all right so now that we have those two images in here we can come back over here and refresh and make sure that they work so use this path um that's a very long file name that's what happens when you download images from that particular social media site that starts with f i'm not gonna call the name because they may be listening but we can rename that at a later time uh let's see we have membership programs scholarship engineering day ah okay so what i want to do i need to go find a few more images but what i want to do is also add some images to this carousel which is what i previously mentioned in the last video so we'll come back up to the carousel and i need to get this image off the clipboard so i don't erase it all right so i'm just going to copy a carousel item well before i do that let me go up here and i'm gonna add some slides so i got zero one two three and four all right and yes that's good all right so we got a div and we need to go from that div to i believe is this one or the next the next one okay i think that's correct save all right and we'll run well probably don't want to run the formatting on it just yet all right so copy that and i'm going to remove that paste and i'm going to check to make sure it didn't break anything in process okay so the image is there and i got a couple of i got one more or two more that probably want to drop in so that's that one that is a i guess i can use this one on the membership page granted all the people in that particular photo are not members but majority of the people in that photo are members so image url and do slash images slash that dot jpg and image alt um uh members uh that's all right so there goes that and so if you have that here boom so cool for as the images go [Music] all right that needs to really be a h3 tag so since i'm here change that to an h3 uh all right now back to the carousel i think i had a cup one more or two more photos not that one this one yes all right so we'll put uh that down here and then there's another photo that's it [Music] yeah that's it so we'll go with this one and put that one down here as well and we come back to the carousel item and scroll down to the div there copy paste and paste and we'll take this file here paste it there and take this one here and paste it there and save and now i think i have all of the carousel items correct all right so like a mist type the jpg is it lowercase jpg and so this is what i was talking about when you go and do file names and the file names are either lowercase or uppercase and they don't quite match that you have that problem looks like the url is correct 12 54 17 jpg saying that the file might be corrupt which is weird um because it just got through showing it so i'm not sure how it's coming to the conclusion that is corrupt all right so that's what i copied that one works that was worse okay um so save again and see images images got it all right so scroll through scroll through woo that is massively large and then that one doesn't work okay how convenient all right so the width is auto and the height is 100 uh percent of the parent and looks like i'm missing the image all right so we got how many so let's collapse okay i don't want to collapse that one two three four five six okay so i got one too many images up here let me take this last one out and save so i got one two three four five and the number of images you have needs to correspond to the number of indicators on your carousel otherwise you're going to get a carousel image that doesn't have well it's going to scroll to the carousel item that doesn't have a corresponding image which will be a problem uh looks like i might be missing a something on a div somewhere not fully sure all right so let's take one of these out see i think that's correct all right so if i do that and three four and it should glitch which it's doing that's fine with me all right so this image i probably don't maybe i don't need to use that particular image um all right so let's put that there well that's the same fault how convenient 5459 okay so let's try this one instead all right and with that there that should work carousel next and first okay okay there we go all right so one two three four five i think this because this image is so large it's not really sure how to handle it which i don't quite agree with why it's not sure with how to handle it um so let's do this let's take well that styling probably doesn't need to be in line i think i need to put a class there instead so let me do a style on this last one so let's do a style uh but that's not going like that can i do that nope doesn't like it got it all right so we'll just cut it put it on the line by itself comment and then do a class of head image it's what i use technically i'm not trying to use this on this line but trying to see if it will actually make a difference and make this fit or not and it doesn't look like it will make it fit um which is fairly weird that it wouldn't want to fit there so let's uh we'll go ahead and do style equal width of 100 percent and heights is auto for this and see what happens with that particular image okay so it's a little bit better uh than what it was before still not scaling the way that i would like it to 75 on that one and see what happens a little bit i'm not sure why still trying to scale because it's supposed to scale to let's take this one out it's supposed to scale to the parent container which is still not there okay and i might just have to just ultimately resize this image all together to 50. all right go back okay so now i have the whole image but i'm not sure why it's not trying to fit to this container here um usually that doesn't happen or at least in my experience it doesn't happen but uh yeah there's that at least it is scrolling all of the other images and they're fitting for the most part let's view this image so okay so the bottom part of this one is also being cut off i didn't realize that um so if we go back so you see here the desk and the floor are not seen in this part and i may need to make some alignment adjustments to this particular photo so i'm actually probably going to do a text was it text line center on that one and see if it moves it up or not okay so it didn't move it up a little bit tricky to deal with but uh yeah we'll go with that for now and so actually i did the wrong image or did i okay so we're going to change i think i did do the wrong image and yeah so let's trace this to about 60 of the width and height auto and if we come back so 60 percent is still within reason for that so all of the images are now looking fairly good in my opinion okay that being said i'm going to do some cleanup here so don't need these h1s anymore worst case scenario go back and copy them out of their respective templates so i'm going to leave that div there in case some text does need to be put in in the future but as you see right now i really don't need that all right so there's that there's that whoops three and all right and i know i mentioned in a previous video that sometimes i leave code in like commented out until the very end as i just absolutely certain that i'm not going to use it but this i know i'm not going to use so i'm just going to go ahead and remove all of this out so again at any point that you're watching this video you know or even after you get done watching this video feel free to drop any comments that you may have or any questions about how i am doing things in here and so once you remove all your comedy code make sure you haven't broken anything in a process because yes while the code is commented out sometimes you actually can break stuff in the process and that's not a good thing so all right so we have our images up here at the top and we have membership has a photo programs as a photo the events pops to another site photos i probably get another image there and then we have this uh city image here and we're going to get officers listed as well as their positions i'm going to do that later i may or may not do that particular part on camera so continuing on the next item i want to work on is the home page so what i did was look at some of the other chapters websites and they do have the these header items here that i commented out so i'm just going to go ahead and restore this particular set of items and go ahead and fill it in so let me go ahead and format this section here or format the document um it may have formatted the entire section though and i think i don't have a corresponding item all right so and i have a container at the top i believe no i don't so um [Music] so this does not need to be in the co well yes it does okay so i only want these heading i guess they call them featurettes or something of that nature you only want those on the home page so i'm going to extend my if condition for my carousel the image thing that at the top of the home page so this thing here is called the carousel so i'm going to extend that or loop include this part of the uh header thing to only show when this down here is not showing as well and [Music] then yeah we'll leave it at that and so for the page body of the index home page i don't need any content so what i'm going to do is to say adios to everything in here delete save and so all of this text down here the bottom should disappear which it has and then all i have now is the headings that are hardcoded into the page which is what i want all right so let's do another formatting of the document to make sure everything is in alignment and it looks like it may or may not be i think i actually don't have i need a closing div for that container slash div all right and so now i have to do a format i think that's correct now yes and all right so i want to highlight certain aspects of the website in this heading section and to do that i'm just going to pick out various things so one of our signature programs is engineering in the park we call it e day at the park all right so i typed that in and looking at it making sure that it actually fits in this space looks good the other thing i want to do is ask people to join so that will be the left block and then on the right hand side i think i'm going to go with programs all right and there we go so we have drawing either at the park and programs should be plural not singular looks like we might have caught it there we go all right and so next we'll have the links so this will go to the programs page plural this will go to the eday page and this will go to the membership page and we'll need to put the leading slash on there all right and so if we test these out they go to the membership page which is correct go to the e-day page which is correct and goes to the program page which is also correct and then i got to figure out some text to drop in i may just do like some preview text so we already have some text here i may just take this copy it and for this particular paragraph drop that in paste and obviously it doesn't like that long line format and let it wrap on its own and there you have it for yes so whoops no not down here here we go right here all right and so i'm gonna put a end container tag of uh and headings and that way as i scroll through this template because this template is fairly long um it's 450 lines exact and that is because of some of the comments are still in here and so forth but i still want to be able to scroll through and be able to find like the beginning and ending of the divs and not have to be like tracing like i've kind of been doing as you've seen me do so this is a little bit easier way just to put a comment there at the end of it and the same thing with like your closing conditions so like for instance at the top of this file here i have several uh conditions here so like this one so for instance this meta tag so at the end of this one i could actually do this in title condition or something like that nature and that helps you be able to find uh that in the file so when you're scrolling through you know if you have five or ten conditions in there that you're looking for it helps you find that ending fairly quickly so you know where to start from and where to scroll back up to all right so i did that for that one let's copy the text for engineering date at the park and i'm gonna just put this here at some point i probably will go back and refine this set of text not while on camera though uh because you know sometimes you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to put here and it's still not come out right all right so and i like when i have paragraphs i like the text in the paragraph to be on its own line that way when i start if i were to add like classes those classes could take up this entire line you know depending on how many you put in here i know some people they rather have their paragraph as concise as possible but i am not necessarily that way readability of the code is more important to me than being concise but there are different schools of thought on that so think about it as you may all right so for this last thing uh we'll go ahead and copy and paste and i'm actually have to change the text i don't know if you actually read it before i saw complete all of these steps listed on the membership page all right and so if you come back here to the home page now all right so we have joined asby we have programs and i'm gonna like i say redef refine these paragraphs here um and also try to make a little bit more even than what they currently are and there's that okay and so uh yeah this is coming out pretty well i did not need to click that page all right so so far so good like i say depending on the feedback i get from the other members in the chapter this color scheme may change as it stands right now i'm sticking with this dark red but it may change to black um at you know a later point so if you're checking this at some point in the future after this video has already been released just know that it may change from the way it looks now and so when you look at it don't be like hey he's got red in the video but black in actuality or green in actuality and that is probably going to be the reason why so just keep that in mind all right so that will wrap things up for this video series um as you see i've taken if you have not seen the other videos in the series a link will be in the description below uh starting from the beginning to the end this you know has been a very week uh education for me because uh in some of the other videos i actually learned how to do things myself for some of the css items that i was not familiar with so it's kind of surprising but you know as i'm teaching others the good thing about it is when you teach others you also learn something yourself um so you're able to even further that advancement of the knowledge that you have to other people so any questions drop those down in the comments section below if you have learned anything from this video series i ask that you please give this video and the other videos in the series a thumbs up if you have any questions comments if you don't want to put your question in a comment shoot me a message on instagram or twitter at almost engr the handle is up in the upper right of your screen i do respond to messages that i receive i do reply back to the comments that are posted so it may take some time for me to do it but i do see it and i do respond alright until next time peace out and hopefully you have a good engineers week","title":"Transcript (Unedited)"},{"location":"technology/2021.02.26-website-coding-day-6%2C-engineers-week-2021/","text":"Video Links https://github.com/almostengr/nsbe-mp.org Transcript (Unedited) i have the contact form created and the only way to access it is to click down here at the bottom i also have some links within the pages themselves that will have a link to the contact page so i want to show you how i'm about to do this form now i could put the email form in the markdown file but i don't want to do that because i tried my best to avoid having html in the markdown file i've done this here but when it comes to an entire form that is a lot of content to have in there so what i'm going to do is actually kind of copy some existing code that i already have and so on my website what i did was normally you cannot submit with a static website submit data so uh and that's kind of a bigger problem because there you have to have some kind of server side processor that will have the ability to be able to handle the data that is being passed to it so what i have done was on my website i created a php file and this is it so i'm just going to go ahead and copy it as is and put it in over here so again i talked about in an earlier video about reusing code that you've already written nothing is wrong with that some people frown upon it but i enjoy it because hey it saves me time like literally i am not having to write this over again and uh visual studio code is trying to be intelligent right there with all of that but i have no um no need to try to fill all of that out all right so what i've done is i've actually copied this code and what it does is you're basically checking to see if a value is set and if it is set you're going to take all the content that is in that form and so here we go so it's a post array and you will literally split that array out into the message body of the email and then you will add the date time to that email as well as uh the service type which i'm gonna have to change to customize to this form with the current time and then the headers which is the from address and then i have a helpdesk email which is a variable that is being sourced from the environment variables which i will show you how to do that here shortly i do not put my environment variables in the version controls it's just a file that sits on the server in production and then a different file that sits in development so it's kind of like a i treat it like a configuration file and that way it's not ever committed to the code base that way i'm not sending emails when i'm trying to test my code i'm not sending those emails from my development environment to actual email addresses that would be bad um so by making this environment file uh that works there so basically you got the helpdesk email which i have an email dedicated to a dedicated email address in production for my particular website on this one it will be a email that is dedicated to the organization kind of a generic email and then that email has forwarding built into it so that you send it to one address and then that one address forwards it to i think it's like four or five different of the executive uh officers of the chapter so uh pretty much want to level that setup and if the mail was successful then redirect to what is a submission page if not then you do a unexpected error and fail out and then if somebody tries to come to this page directly then it redirects back to the home page by default that being said all right so i have my submit.php and so what i'm going to do is to add a condition in here that will check to see if we are on the con contact not contract contact page so if page.url is equal to contact i believe that's how that's set up with the there and then i also want to do a else and then so if we're not on the contact page show the page content if we are on the contact page show this particular form that i am about to code out format all right there we go so that being said you want to have you want to have some information in here let's see you want to have the form in here so that uh it shows only on that page okay so do form and we're going to have the method of post and the action will post to the submit php page that we just created and close that form out cool now i recommend having recaptcha on your forms i'm not going to cover how to do that or i may come at a later point and cover how to do that but uh recapture basically you go into google then you do a search for google recaptcha and they give you a key and token and so forth and then you copy the text the copy what they give you to paste it on your page and that verifies it somehow magically hooks i think with the use of shell script i mean cell scripts javascript it will hook into your form and so basically if the recaptcha is not completed then your form is not allowed to be submitted so that's a you know helpful way to prevent from getting spam all right so pretty much i'm going to replicate what is already here on the current form that we use on the website and so go ahead and start out trying to see let me look at the source for this particular page um curious on how this was set up now mind you this is a drupal form and so uh the drupal way of doing things may not be the most efficient way of doing things but it is here nonetheless okay so they have a form id with the method of posts and the form post back to itself and then it looks like each element or each field on the form is contained within a div and they have a label as well as a input for each of those items so that is very doable here so we'll do a label and we'll do a label for and the uh we'll call it uh requester name i try not to use keywords in my labeling or uh attributes if you will of the page so that's where that comes from all right and so we'll call it name and the next one we'll do an input of type text and once you have it with a placeholder it says enter your name there we go and this field is going to be required and i know some people they just like to do the single attribute so they'll type required like that personally i hate this because when you look at it if you're just scanning and looking at the attributes it looks like this particular attribute does not have a value associated so what i usually do is required equals required and i know that's like well but that's that is valid html um believe it or not so when there is a attribute that has that really doesn't have a value usually the attribute is also the same thing as that value so required equals required and um i think there's a yeah mainly so instead of just people just typing two or three letters for the sake of this you should want to try to get them to type their full first and last name in here so i'm gonna set the min link to four and so that way if they try to type it in and it doesn't uh it should not pass for that reason all right so i also want to include the form control on this particular form and the reason being is because the form control provides some css styling that is built into bootstrap and so i want to be able to leverage that i also need to set a name in here and i probably need to wrap this on the well probably wrap itself so set the name to request their name on this and i mean you could just set this name set the label for equal to name and then name equals name but that in my opinion looks rather weird so i tried to avoid those type of setups i know some people they don't mind it nor do they care they're more concerned with if it works it works and i shouldn't be concerned with what it actually says but you really should be concerned with what it actually says all right so the next one is the email field we're going to change this to email address likewise email address and i don't know what i just did there email address the type is email and yes that is a valid type enter your email address that field is required and a main length let's see is really a one two so even if you had a at b dot c a at b dot c so it's at least five characters so we're gonna set that to five that way the forum won't just be submitted um it'll probably be a pain for some people that are just trying to get through this form really quickly but we're really trying to reduce the amount of spam submissions that are being submitted so uh that's how you do that you set them in link all right so phone call is what i'm gonna call this instead of phone number um because some spam box can figure out these things so or uh actually we'll have a little bit of fun here so i'm gonna name this field call tyrone and the label is actually going to be phone number and we're going to call tyrone oh type equals phone i think there's a type uh is there a type of telephone so let's see uh input field types phone number all right so for phone number you have a telephone type and hey well why not just go ahead and copy this piece of snippet here i didn't there we go all right so paste use that pattern and that pattern is a regular expression um depending on where you're at that may or may not work uh so just a placeholder and do it five five five five five five five five all right um we'll set this to required uh and then length is uh let's see that is ten digit phone number with two extra characters so a min length of 12 and close that out in that div so div class form control and we have another which i'll go ahead and copy copy paste say form control and if you come back to here we have subjects i don't really think we i mean short summary may be helpful but i think i'm gonna go ahead and inject my own summary here uh when the form processor so i'm actually going to do this last one as message comment or question not request and we'll do this as message and actually probably want to do this as a i believe that is a text area not a input yes it is all right so we're going to cancel that i mean not cancel comment that for the moment so text area and name is message and let's see what we have so we have 5 rows in 60 columns and the placeholder is messaged with the name and required okay all right so we'll do uh required is equal to required no not requester required there we go all right name rows is five columns we'll stick with uh well we're not gonna specify the columns we'll see how that plays out without that piece of information being present and let's see placeholder uh enter your message text all right so if we come back and refresh the page we do not have the page body and it's probably because of this url all right so there we go all right so we have our page body it looks weird because well it is weird nonetheless all right need to see where things may be going a little funky with this um so we have a div that's inside of a container we have a form and a form has a form control uh maybe that form control is the problem because hey my message message message okay that's there um all right so let's take these divs out matter of fact let me start at the top and work my way back down to see if that will make a difference in the presentation of it okay so that works um and i was going off of what existed previously but you probably should not have dev okay all right so that being said now i need to i'm going to use paragraph tags instead that way i don't have to do line breaks after each one and it should automatically break yes there we go all right so uh that's a closing okay there we go that there that there that there and that there all right safe all right and so now to get our labels above um do line breaks on each one you could put your label on the line by itself to be honest and so instead of this do that and then do that whoops there we go safe now how does that look so that looks pretty well and if i put the class uh form control on here it should do some styling here yeah so it stretches it out the entire width of the screen which is what i want all right so to do the same for the other elements some have to oops copy yeah there we go and go ahead and move this up paste and while we add it remove that other code that is no longer needed so that there right save so now um the next part is to actually i didn't do that for the labels like i should have so we'll come back here and drop that in behind each of the labels and then we'll save and then come back and put the label excuse me the class of form control on each of the labels copy paste put that in there paste do a format right quick because that's a little iffy looking all right and now we have our labels accordingly so if we come back again to our labels i want to make sure that people know that they are required so there's a label attribute called required um or is it is required maybe this is required okay that's not there i may have to come in and define that we also want to do font weight bold on this all right so that is bolded and that's what we want and so come over to the css uh that's bmp css there we go all right and i'm gonna go down here at the bottom and do a dot required and i want to is it after something uh let me see how i did it in here because there is a way that you can have your page excuse me there's a way that you can have the css to add characters to the beginning or the ending of an element and i'm not sure if i i know i've done it on other sites i'm not sure if i've done it on this one yep here we go so label required and literally i can just copy this and paste that in required after and label that required and i want to use the um we'll go with the nesby red on this one since this is a brighter red color so if you come back to the page uh not required the required is a class and that class is on that label it should accept oh it doesn't accept that because i need to minify the file and there we go all right and so my metaphy file is being referenced in my html here so that's why that did not work all right the next thing um these attributes look a little bit small compared to what they probably should be on the page and also kind of look a little bit spaced out in my opinion so let me do this with the line break instead and that's a little bit closer and then i think i'm gonna make this a little bit bigger so we can just take out each of these paragraphs and replace them with line breaks and sometimes you'll have to do i know you're thinking well you just typed that code in now you're taking it back out yes because sometimes when you're designing things you run you know you type it initially and then when you actually look at it once you've implemented your light that doesn't look right it needs to be fixed and so that's essentially what has happened in this case for me is i didn't like the way it looked so i went back and redid it being very proficient with the keyboard and the shortcut short keys or excuse me the short being proficient with these keyboard and the shortcuts on the keyboard for the application that you are using helps i use visual studio code for my personal development but i also use uh visual studio in my day-to-day work and so sometimes that has a tendency because i'll type the wrong shortcut in and get either no action or get an unexpected action and that's always interesting to have to deal with after the fact all right the last thing i need is a input button of type submit with name submit and value of submit that is proper cased and saved and then also need to add the class of vtn and the btn um there's another btn i'm not sure what it is hold on all right so i got to input let's go to the css and look for the dtn classes so we got a btn got a btn footer you got a regular btn for the links all right so whoops and that's associated with that all right so coming back so let's do btn.dark for the moment and see what that looks like so that looks fine um i don't know if it's black or not let me see inspect element and pcn dark is dot black all right so what i think i'm going to do is to go ahead and overwrite so btn do a class btn-dark and um we'll do a background come on color that is black and save and so re uh modify the file that will update the css for it and if we refresh the page and do an inspect element this should have all zeros which it does so that is good to go all right so we'll close out the dev console and come back over here and copy the text off of the uh wait a minute oh i do have text on this page okay so let me do come back to the page because i realize now my if condition is incorrect so i don't need this else here but i do need that page content because the page content and actually in this particular scenario the page content comes above this if condition because i want the form to be at the bottom of the page not at the top all right now we have everything on the compact page correct so we have our introductory set of information along with social media and email at the bottom and just a basic form message comment question now the submit handler is set up it should not do anything well yeah okay should verify that this field is not blank all right so you type that in there it's still blowing red for the uh the phone number which is should because it's not in the expected format all right so if we do submit so at least 12 characters you are using eight so let's see all right okay so we're still complaining that format does not match which is great and this one is already being validated because if we come here should be being validated as an email address if not i need to um i'm not sure if i have a email form so i can come back to my partial i have a contact i don't think i have a contact i do have a request service page that has a form on that emailer placeholder you got emailer men link is equal to five on the form that i use and the placeholder text is there um i don't think i put it placeholder text in here so user add i'm gonna do an sbmp.org to place that and we'll do all right so formats of each of those and we'll change this here to i have a question about svmp and so if i come back to the site and so placeholder text is filled in behind here and if you actually go ahead and click contact again that will clear out the entire form the placeholder text is there if you try to submit it by default obviously it's not going to do anything but that is how that works and then our submit function which will be called by this particular url we'll send it over to our submit page and then we need to have a page that the submit page or the submit script rather redirects to so we're going to call that submission and so name that submission.md and looking at my existing code i think the only thing i have in submission is that that page is not indexed and so if we go back over to the docs folder and mine i actually think i have it submit slash index no that's not it okay so here we go submission and so my submission has a redirect built into it and that is it so let's look at the raw text and literally just copy that and paste that in here title submission successful and it needs to redirect back to the root page i also need a [Music] as you see in the submission page i do not want google to index this nor do i want it to follow the links on this page um it could follow the link because this link actually just goes back to the home page but i don't want it to follow the link and i don't want it to index it so i've added this robot's uh attribute in here and in my base template file i have in the metadata as soon as we can get back up to the top of the screen here i have a robots attribute here that says that if the robot's file if the robot's keyword is in the metadata of that particular page then you follow what's in there otherwise you can do it index and follow for whatever it is so uh no concerns would this be an index and should not be to further make sure that that doesn't happen we can come actually come down here to the robot.txt and come think of it i actually need to move this so we're going to cut that from right there and put that into the docs folder um there we go so we have a robot txt and you can have a disallow attribute here and do a slash submission be that and then um there's also slash submission slash index.html all right and so that way it ensures that no crawler will run across this file and put the submission page as a page on a google search result or go or bing or whatever you use for your primary search engine and then the submission page um this submission script rather it should email out and if you want this you can just copy it out of the repository the link is down in the description below where you can view this repository you will need to define some variables here i have helped this email in here and i think i'm still going to leave it at that and then that will be sourced in a configuration file this path may need to change depending on what it has or where it's located on the server in production i haven't logged into the production server in some time so i will need to figure out where i can stick this outside of the web route so that this can be called as neby so that is essentially how i do forms within a mk docs website so if i come back to the contact us page so as you see we have a full form here and ready to go i know some people they put the submit button as the uh well submit and then there's usually a link that goes to cancel or something of that nature i usually don't do that usually i figure if somebody's going to go to a page and they don't really want to submit it they'll find and go to wherever else they need to go so they may click the contact page again and that will clear that out for them or they'll go up here and hit refresh and which will also clear that out for them too all right that being said move on to the next item and i think i have all of my pages covered so my social medias are working and they are referenced on the contact page phone number is working for the chapter we have our links that point to various aspects of things on nsbe and what i want to do that i'm just now noticing is like i don't have the https on all of the urls that reference some of the other sites so i want to go ahead and put the https in there does it make a difference maybe maybe not but if the https does not work that's not my fault that means the url on the other end is not using https and while it may penalize my site i'd rather redirect users to another https site instead of just the http due to uh demand in the middle of the tax that exists as well as the google you know factoring in https for its own site and for its own purposes so here we have all of these things corrected let's do format on this uh uh actually do a trim on this thing and then do format all right and so i notice it's weird i was doing some of these paragraph tags on one line and some of them not on the other so let's do format again all right so i like to see consistency in my work and because i like to make sure that it is readable a little bit of ocd if you ask uh me in some regards but i do believe that neatness is helpful and a little bit of spacing is useful like as you see i use one space between blocks of code i know some people they'll use four or three or two after that but i just go with one because obviously everything else is bumped up next to each other so i know that's one grouping same thing here with this particular card i know this entire card is grouped together because i have a separator of white space or blank line if you will in between the two all right so contact form is done with the page content showing and just to verify that i haven't broken anything else again go through your site checking looking at the various pages make sure everything is still the same images are not you know sideways or anything of that nature buttons are still appropriately displayed and links are still working and that's not the link that i wanted to click all right program so we come over here look at some of the stuff here at the scholarship and so forth and so um yeah so there's that i may do another role of these blocks here that also highlight the scholarship program that we have some other information maybe about the chapter and maybe another block for membership um so matter of fact i guess we can just go ahead and work on that now and as soon as i can locate the text alright so here we have a container and a row so what i'm going to do is actually just go ahead and copy this entire row from get her here copy enter paste there we go all right and so for this one want to we'll do join nsbe on this one and i know in the other video you probably like from the other video you probably may have remembered if you have watched it it's like did we already do this yes and i went back and changed them because i thought that it would be more appropriate to highlight the involvement of the kids and there as well as some of the other things um first instead of what i originally had which i think the first name was join so we'll put this scholarship and what's the other thing i can highlight uh so i have joined scholarship and let's see programs professional development we got our nesbi jr already highlighted about and i guess we could do meetings as the other thing because we do have meetings every month so we'll do meetings here and i'm actually going to take this and put the meetings up here before programs and cut that programs off there and put it down here at the bottom and save and so yeah all right and so meetings so and i'm [Music] actually okay for the meetings i really can display all of the information here for meetings and it pretty much is that uh tuesdays first of each month all right so if we come over here to got that we got the first three and then we got the um so i'm gonna do like i mentioned earlier uh have a closing tag so end of first row and then come down here to the bottom well end of headings is fine so scholarship programs meetings so in the meetings block we'll put that there save come back to the home page and so we have meetings um clean up this text meetings are held the first tuesday each month at 6 00 p.m central time there we go all right uh and so now i'll come back at some point later and update this join i can go ahead and do the links right now at least so the join will go to the membership page the scholarship will go to the scholarship page and the programs will go to the programs page which is good and then the meetings will also go to the programs page as well and so if we do meetings and scroll down and i actually want to do a uh so we do programs with uh i guess the jump to professional development we'll save that and so if we go here and then back to meetings it should jump down to professional development which it does so that's good all right and um a membership that goes to membership all right cool and the scholarship goes there and so a couple of things i want to get is a sign up mailing list sign up page uh we'll actually get have to get the information or a piece of the information from mailchimp because they provide a like i think a form builder in their site that you can use and that form builder will spit out whatever it spits out and then all you have to do is copy and paste that into the page itself and it should be good to go all right so if i have some additional uh i guess call out actions here i can add that here but um it looks a little bit better now that i have more items here because originally i was just thinking that there was a few items um here and it was not very much white space to be honest and i wanted a little bit more white space taken up or more things that's taken up in the white section of the page so it's good to have a little bit more content here on the home page for that um so if you come back over here uh so your jump down links work as well there like you should if you come over here so this is one of the contact pages links that i was talking about so you click that here and it goes to the contact page and all the contact information is here melon dress phone and so forth all right so scrolling through everything else still looks like it works like it should this image here i'm not sure why this image is still acting the way it's acting but it is active when the way it's acting and so um not really much i can do about that at this time but hopefully i'll get that addressed so these buttons are turning gray when i mouse over not sure if i'm okay with that let's go back over and look at so we have the secondary button class here on those um is that right yeah i got the center secondary button class on here i'm not sure if i want to keep that secondary button class or not i guess it wouldn't hurt that that's there um the worst case scenario again and probably just have to take it back off and change it to something else maybe change it to black so instead of secondary we'll change this to btn dark and if we come back up here which one did i change so the join all right so that turns black and it kind of coordinates with the buttons down here at the bottom so i guess i'll go ahead and do that with the rest so btn dart btn dark dark dark dark dark and dark there we go all right so when you mouse over now they all turn black well i forgot one oops which is fairly easy to do sometimes all right so now that one turns black all right so we are good on each of those and then it's good to see that each of these headings are lined up across even though the items above are not necessarily the same height that these second row of things are aligned because of the fact they are in a row um so going to resize this just to show you the resizing of the items so let's say you're on a phone and you're looking at this this is what it would look like so you have this navigation here and that's not centered but um and that's really not centered so that's something we have to address as well actually none of these photos are centered so uh i had to see how i can address that so that at least the center of the photo is there and it is being resized accordingly because that is not resizing like how i would like it to or it to be the carousel but these the individual heading or subsections down here on the home page they look pretty decent to me as well as the items in the footer they are sorted how i would like them to be with the copyright down at the bottom so if we click the hamburg icon and just go to the other pages and see how they look you want to check to make sure that when you're building a website that you resize it now you can use the dev tools it's the dev tools it does have a mobile setup so if you hit f12 and come over i believe it's over here there you go so and you can change it to the corresponding device that you want to use but my personal preference is just to not do it that way instead i rather take it out of mobile mode and i'd rather just resize the entire screen over here and then you're able to see it how things will look in that resized uh position and so so far everything is looking all right to me and i gotta learn that that the events goes to a different page not here all right so this page is pretty straightforward i'll probably i actually will put a heading or header graphic there just like this has a heading graphic and to complete this section here of the executive board and all the scroll bars and everything else um but what you don't want to have is a website that has a horizontal scroll bar meaning a scroll bar that goes left and right because personally i hate having to scroll left and right even when i write my code i don't have it in a way now because i have it zoomed in it's going to have the scroll bar here when i pull up this uh left sidebar but when i do that it is resized and it doesn't have a horizontal scroll bar and just to make sure my lines don't get too long to prevent that i have this character line set at roughly about i believe 80 uh characters or something like that nature or this it says a hundred and it says 111 so it's probably setting like 110 or something like that nature and that way you get a decent amount of line you know all the way across and uh it works but not so far of a line that it just keeps going and going and going because i know some people they like to write their lines as very long and they end up having to scroll left and right up and down that's very difficult in my opinion to manage it's easier if i can see like for instance this could easily span this text area could obviously run off the edge of the screen if i would have put another attribute in here as you see is right at the edge but i'd rather be able to see this entire thing on a single line i mean excuse me on a single screen versus having it on a single line but that is a prep prince that is usually determined by each developer all right yeah so let's see what page i am missing i have a photos page it'd be kind of ironic to not have a photo on the photos page maybe that's just me so let's fix that right quick so i have some existing photos in here uh let's copy we'll go with this one so we just copy it and on the photos page here we go so using our metadata image url slash images i wish we would have copied that didn't i believe this is this is this one or this one actually i'll yeah so let's copy that all right so that slash jpg and image alt all right and so now if we come back to the photo page yeah there we go and alternate text so we do view image info we got the alternate text it did not say that is it not there that is weird all right new page source if i can do that um i actually do i'm gonna do inspect element and use the inspector to so the alt tag did not show up i wonder why oh cause i mistyped alt and this atl versus alt that's a big difference all right so now there we go so we have our alt text and if we do image info oops image info there we go we have the associated text there all right f12 on that so that's good and i'm gonna have to come back and resize that image anyway because when you do the full size of that image it does blow up to mass proportion um because it's in this original size and so i need to scale it down so that when i run the speed test on this site once it is deployed to us in production environment that i get a good speed test rating a lot of times you will get a bad speed test rating not because of the number of images on the page but because the size of the emerald images like resolution size of the images are way too high like they're in their original format and so you have to scale them down otherwise your speed scores particularly for the mobile devices speed score will be very low or medium to very low desktops are usually more tolerant of that larger file size because they usually have higher connection speeds so usually a 100 megabit or even gigabit internet versus a mobile phone that does not necessarily have that type of connection speed so there's the difference in that regard that will wrap things up for this video going back tomorrow for the last part of the series where i discuss the automated deployment setup as well as do a final review of the website after it has been deployed into production until next time peace out","title":"Website Coding Day 6, Engineers Week

have the contact form created and the only way to access it is to click down here at the bottom i also have some links within the pages themselves that will have a link to the contact page so i want to show you how i'm about to do this form now i could put the email form in the markdown file but i don't want to do that because i tried my best to avoid having html in the markdown file i've done this here but when it comes to an entire form that is a lot of content to have in there so what i'm going to do is actually kind of copy some existing code that i already have and so on my website what i did was normally you cannot submit with a static website submit data so uh and that's kind of a bigger problem because there you have to have some kind of server side processor that will have the ability to be able to handle the data that is being passed to it so what i have done was on my website i created a php file and this is it so i'm just going to go ahead and copy it as is and put it in over here so again i talked about in an earlier video about reusing code that you've already written nothing is wrong with that some people frown upon it but i enjoy it because hey it saves me time like literally i am not having to write this over again and uh visual studio code is trying to be intelligent right there with all of that but i have no um no need to try to fill all of that out all right so what i've done is i've actually copied this code and what it does is you're basically checking to see if a value is set and if it is set you're going to take all the content that is in that form and so here we go so it's a post array and you will literally split that array out into the message body of the email and then you will add the date time to that email as well as uh the service type which i'm gonna have to change to customize to this form with the current time and then the headers which is the from address and then i have a helpdesk email which is a variable that is being sourced from the environment variables which i will show you how to do that here shortly i do not put my environment variables in the version controls it's just a file that sits on the server in production and then a different file that sits in development so it's kind of like a i treat it like a configuration file and that way it's not ever committed to the code base that way i'm not sending emails when i'm trying to test my code i'm not sending those emails from my development environment to actual email addresses that would be bad um so by making this environment file uh that works there so basically you got the helpdesk email which i have an email dedicated to a dedicated email address in production for my particular website on this one it will be a email that is dedicated to the organization kind of a generic email and then that email has forwarding built into it so that you send it to one address and then that one address forwards it to i think it's like four or five different of the executive uh officers of the chapter so uh pretty much want to level that setup and if the mail was successful then redirect to what is a submission page if not then you do a unexpected error and fail out and then if somebody tries to come to this page directly then it redirects back to the home page by default that being said all right so i have my submit.php and so what i'm going to do is to add a condition in here that will check to see if we are on the con contact not contract contact page so if page.url is equal to contact i believe that's how that's set up with the there and then i also want to do a else and then so if we're not on the contact page show the page content if we are on the contact page show this particular form that i am about to code out format all right there we go so that being said you want to have you want to have some information in here let's see you want to have the form in here so that uh it shows only on that page okay so do form and we're going to have the method of post and the action will post to the submit php page that we just created and close that form out cool now i recommend having recaptcha on your forms i'm not going to cover how to do that or i may come at a later point and cover how to do that but uh recapture basically you go into google then you do a search for google recaptcha and they give you a key and token and so forth and then you copy the text the copy what they give you to paste it on your page and that verifies it somehow magically hooks i think with the use of shell script i mean cell scripts javascript it will hook into your form and so basically if the recaptcha is not completed then your form is not allowed to be submitted so that's a you know helpful way to prevent from getting spam all right so pretty much i'm going to replicate what is already here on the current form that we use on the website and so go ahead and start out trying to see let me look at the source for this particular page um curious on how this was set up now mind you this is a drupal form and so uh the drupal way of doing things may not be the most efficient way of doing things but it is here nonetheless okay so they have a form id with the method of posts and the form post back to itself and then it looks like each element or each field on the form is contained within a div and they have a label as well as a input for each of those items so that is very doable here so we'll do a label and we'll do a label for and the uh we'll call it uh requester name i try not to use keywords in my labeling or uh attributes if you will of the page so that's where that comes from all right and so we'll call it name and the next one we'll do an input of type text and once you have it with a placeholder it says enter your name there we go and this field is going to be required and i know some people they just like to do the single attribute so they'll type required like that personally i hate this because when you look at it if you're just scanning and looking at the attributes it looks like this particular attribute does not have a value associated so what i usually do is required equals required and i know that's like well but that's that is valid html um believe it or not so when there is a attribute that has that really doesn't have a value usually the attribute is also the same thing as that value so required equals required and um i think there's a yeah mainly so instead of just people just typing two or three letters for the sake of this you should want to try to get them to type their full first and last name in here so i'm gonna set the min link to four and so that way if they try to type it in and it doesn't uh it should not pass for that reason all right so i also want to include the form control on this particular form and the reason being is because the form control provides some css styling that is built into bootstrap and so i want to be able to leverage that i also need to set a name in here and i probably need to wrap this on the well probably wrap itself so set the name to request their name on this and i mean you could just set this name set the label for equal to name and then name equals name but that in my opinion looks rather weird so i tried to avoid those type of setups i know some people they don't mind it nor do they care they're more concerned with if it works it works and i shouldn't be concerned with what it actually says but you really should be concerned with what it actually says all right so the next one is the email field we're going to change this to email address likewise email address and i don't know what i just did there email address the type is email and yes that is a valid type enter your email address that field is required and a main length let's see is really a one two so even if you had a at b dot c a at b dot c so it's at least five characters so we're gonna set that to five that way the forum won't just be submitted um it'll probably be a pain for some people that are just trying to get through this form really quickly but we're really trying to reduce the amount of spam submissions that are being submitted so uh that's how you do that you set them in link all right so phone call is what i'm gonna call this instead of phone number um because some spam box can figure out these things so or uh actually we'll have a little bit of fun here so i'm gonna name this field call tyrone and the label is actually going to be phone number and we're going to call tyrone oh type equals phone i think there's a type uh is there a type of telephone so let's see uh input field types phone number all right so for phone number you have a telephone type and hey well why not just go ahead and copy this piece of snippet here i didn't there we go all right so paste use that pattern and that pattern is a regular expression um depending on where you're at that may or may not work uh so just a placeholder and do it five five five five five five five five all right um we'll set this to required uh and then length is uh let's see that is ten digit phone number with two extra characters so a min length of 12 and close that out in that div so div class form control and we have another which i'll go ahead and copy copy paste say form control and if you come back to here we have subjects i don't really think we i mean short summary may be helpful but i think i'm gonna go ahead and inject my own summary here uh when the form processor so i'm actually going to do this last one as message comment or question not request and we'll do this as message and actually probably want to do this as a i believe that is a text area not a input yes it is all right so we're going to cancel that i mean not cancel comment that for the moment so text area and name is message and let's see what we have so we have 5 rows in 60 columns and the placeholder is messaged with the name and required okay all right so we'll do uh required is equal to required no not requester required there we go all right name rows is five columns we'll stick with uh well we're not gonna specify the columns we'll see how that plays out without that piece of information being present and let's see placeholder uh enter your message text all right so if we come back and refresh the page we do not have the page body and it's probably because of this url all right so there we go all right so we have our page body it looks weird because well it is weird nonetheless all right need to see where things may be going a little funky with this um so we have a div that's inside of a container we have a form and a form has a form control uh maybe that form control is the problem because hey my message message message okay that's there um all right so let's take these divs out matter of fact let me start at the top and work my way back down to see if that will make a difference in the presentation of it okay so that works um and i was going off of what existed previously but you probably should not have dev okay all right so that being said now i need to i'm going to use paragraph tags instead that way i don't have to do line breaks after each one and it should automatically break yes there we go all right so uh that's a closing okay there we go that there that there that there and that there all right safe all right and so now to get our labels above um do line breaks on each one you could put your label on the line by itself to be honest and so instead of this do that and then do that whoops there we go safe now how does that look so that looks pretty well and if i put the class uh form control on here it should do some styling here yeah so it stretches it out the entire width of the screen which is what i want all right so to do the same for the other elements some have to oops copy yeah there we go and go ahead and move this up paste and while we add it remove that other code that is no longer needed so that there right save so now um the next part is to actually i didn't do that for the labels like i should have so we'll come back here and drop that in behind each of the labels and then we'll save and then come back and put the label excuse me the class of form control on each of the labels copy paste put that in there paste do a format right quick because that's a little iffy looking all right and now we have our labels accordingly so if we come back again to our labels i want to make sure that people know that they are required so there's a label attribute called required um or is it is required maybe this is required okay that's not there i may have to come in and define that we also want to do font weight bold on this all right so that is bolded and that's what we want and so come over to the css uh that's bmp css there we go all right and i'm gonna go down here at the bottom and do a dot required and i want to is it after something uh let me see how i did it in here because there is a way that you can have your page excuse me there's a way that you can have the css to add characters to the beginning or the ending of an element and i'm not sure if i i know i've done it on other sites i'm not sure if i've done it on this one yep here we go so label required and literally i can just copy this and paste that in required after and label that required and i want to use the um we'll go with the nesby red on this one since this is a brighter red color so if you come back to the page uh not required the required is a class and that class is on that label it should accept oh it doesn't accept that because i need to minify the file and there we go all right and so my metaphy file is being referenced in my html here so that's why that did not work all right the next thing um these attributes look a little bit small compared to what they probably should be on the page and also kind of look a little bit spaced out in my opinion so let me do this with the line break instead and that's a little bit closer and then i think i'm gonna make this a little bit bigger so we can just take out each of these paragraphs and replace them with line breaks and sometimes you'll have to do i know you're thinking well you just typed that code in now you're taking it back out yes because sometimes when you're designing things you run you know you type it initially and then when you actually look at it once you've implemented your light that doesn't look right it needs to be fixed and so that's essentially what has happened in this case for me is i didn't like the way it looked so i went back and redid it being very proficient with the keyboard and the shortcut short keys or excuse me the short being proficient with these keyboard and the shortcuts on the keyboard for the application that you are using helps i use visual studio code for my personal development but i also use uh visual studio in my day-to-day work and so sometimes that has a tendency because i'll type the wrong shortcut in and get either no action or get an unexpected action and that's always interesting to have to deal with after the fact all right the last thing i need is a input button of type submit with name submit and value of submit that is proper cased and saved and then also need to add the class of vtn and the btn um there's another btn i'm not sure what it is hold on all right so i got to input let's go to the css and look for the dtn classes so we got a btn got a btn footer you got a regular btn for the links all right so whoops and that's associated with that all right so coming back so let's do btn.dark for the moment and see what that looks like so that looks fine um i don't know if it's black or not let me see inspect element and pcn dark is dot black all right so what i think i'm going to do is to go ahead and overwrite so btn do a class btn-dark and um we'll do a background come on color that is black and save and so re uh modify the file that will update the css for it and if we refresh the page and do an inspect element this should have all zeros which it does so that is good to go all right so we'll close out the dev console and come back over here and copy the text off of the uh wait a minute oh i do have text on this page okay so let me do come back to the page because i realize now my if condition is incorrect so i don't need this else here but i do need that page content because the page content and actually in this particular scenario the page content comes above this if condition because i want the form to be at the bottom of the page not at the top all right now we have everything on the compact page correct so we have our introductory set of information along with social media and email at the bottom and just a basic form message comment question now the submit handler is set up it should not do anything well yeah okay should verify that this field is not blank all right so you type that in there it's still blowing red for the uh the phone number which is should because it's not in the expected format all right so if we do submit so at least 12 characters you are using eight so let's see all right okay so we're still complaining that format does not match which is great and this one is already being validated because if we come here should be being validated as an email address if not i need to um i'm not sure if i have a email form so i can come back to my partial i have a contact i don't think i have a contact i do have a request service page that has a form on that emailer placeholder you got emailer men link is equal to five on the form that i use and the placeholder text is there um i don't think i put it placeholder text in here so user add i'm gonna do an sbmp.org to place that and we'll do all right so formats of each of those and we'll change this here to i have a question about svmp and so if i come back to the site and so placeholder text is filled in behind here and if you actually go ahead and click contact again that will clear out the entire form the placeholder text is there if you try to submit it by default obviously it's not going to do anything but that is how that works and then our submit function which will be called by this particular url we'll send it over to our submit page and then we need to have a page that the submit page or the submit script rather redirects to so we're going to call that submission and so name that submission.md and looking at my existing code i think the only thing i have in submission is that that page is not indexed and so if we go back over to the docs folder and mine i actually think i have it submit slash index no that's not it okay so here we go submission and so my submission has a redirect built into it and that is it so let's look at the raw text and literally just copy that and paste that in here title submission successful and it needs to redirect back to the root page i also need a [Music] as you see in the submission page i do not want google to index this nor do i want it to follow the links on this page um it could follow the link because this link actually just goes back to the home page but i don't want it to follow the link and i don't want it to index it so i've added this robot's uh attribute in here and in my base template file i have in the metadata as soon as we can get back up to the top of the screen here i have a robots attribute here that says that if the robot's file if the robot's keyword is in the metadata of that particular page then you follow what's in there otherwise you can do it index and follow for whatever it is so uh no concerns would this be an index and should not be to further make sure that that doesn't happen we can come actually come down here to the robot.txt and come think of it i actually need to move this so we're going to cut that from right there and put that into the docs folder um there we go so we have a robot txt and you can have a disallow attribute here and do a slash submission be that and then um there's also slash submission slash index.html all right and so that way it ensures that no crawler will run across this file and put the submission page as a page on a google search result or go or bing or whatever you use for your primary search engine and then the submission page um this submission script rather it should email out and if you want this you can just copy it out of the repository the link is down in the description below where you can view this repository you will need to define some variables here i have helped this email in here and i think i'm still going to leave it at that and then that will be sourced in a configuration file this path may need to change depending on what it has or where it's located on the server in production i haven't logged into the production server in some time so i will need to figure out where i can stick this outside of the web route so that this can be called as neby so that is essentially how i do forms within a mk docs website so if i come back to the contact us page so as you see we have a full form here and ready to go i know some people they put the submit button as the uh well submit and then there's usually a link that goes to cancel or something of that nature i usually don't do that usually i figure if somebody's going to go to a page and they don't really want to submit it they'll find and go to wherever else they need to go so they may click the contact page again and that will clear that out for them or they'll go up here and hit refresh and which will also clear that out for them too all right that being said move on to the next item and i think i have all of my pages covered so my social medias are working and they are referenced on the contact page phone number is working for the chapter we have our links that point to various aspects of things on nsbe and what i want to do that i'm just now noticing is like i don't have the https on all of the urls that reference some of the other sites so i want to go ahead and put the https in there does it make a difference maybe maybe not but if the https does not work that's not my fault that means the url on the other end is not using https and while it may penalize my site i'd rather redirect users to another https site instead of just the http due to uh demand in the middle of the tax that exists as well as the google you know factoring in https for its own site and for its own purposes so here we have all of these things corrected let's do format on this uh uh actually do a trim on this thing and then do format all right and so i notice it's weird i was doing some of these paragraph tags on one line and some of them not on the other so let's do format again all right so i like to see consistency in my work and because i like to make sure that it is readable a little bit of ocd if you ask uh me in some regards but i do believe that neatness is helpful and a little bit of spacing is useful like as you see i use one space between blocks of code i know some people they'll use four or three or two after that but i just go with one because obviously everything else is bumped up next to each other so i know that's one grouping same thing here with this particular card i know this entire card is grouped together because i have a separator of white space or blank line if you will in between the two all right so contact form is done with the page content showing and just to verify that i haven't broken anything else again go through your site checking looking at the various pages make sure everything is still the same images are not you know sideways or anything of that nature buttons are still appropriately displayed and links are still working and that's not the link that i wanted to click all right program so we come over here look at some of the stuff here at the scholarship and so forth and so um yeah so there's that i may do another role of these blocks here that also highlight the scholarship program that we have some other information maybe about the chapter and maybe another block for membership um so matter of fact i guess we can just go ahead and work on that now and as soon as i can locate the text alright so here we have a container and a row so what i'm going to do is actually just go ahead and copy this entire row from get her here copy enter paste there we go all right and so for this one want to we'll do join nsbe on this one and i know in the other video you probably like from the other video you probably may have remembered if you have watched it it's like did we already do this yes and i went back and changed them because i thought that it would be more appropriate to highlight the involvement of the kids and there as well as some of the other things um first instead of what i originally had which i think the first name was join so we'll put this scholarship and what's the other thing i can highlight uh so i have joined scholarship and let's see programs professional development we got our nesbi jr already highlighted about and i guess we could do meetings as the other thing because we do have meetings every month so we'll do meetings here and i'm actually going to take this and put the meetings up here before programs and cut that programs off there and put it down here at the bottom and save and so yeah all right and so meetings so and i'm [Music] actually okay for the meetings i really can display all of the information here for meetings and it pretty much is that uh tuesdays first of each month all right so if we come over here to got that we got the first three and then we got the um so i'm gonna do like i mentioned earlier uh have a closing tag so end of first row and then come down here to the bottom well end of headings is fine so scholarship programs meetings so in the meetings block we'll put that there save come back to the home page and so we have meetings um clean up this text meetings are held the first tuesday each month at 6 00 p.m central time there we go all right uh and so now i'll come back at some point later and update this join i can go ahead and do the links right now at least so the join will go to the membership page the scholarship will go to the scholarship page and the programs will go to the programs page which is good and then the meetings will also go to the programs page as well and so if we do meetings and scroll down and i actually want to do a uh so we do programs with uh i guess the jump to professional development we'll save that and so if we go here and then back to meetings it should jump down to professional development which it does so that's good all right and um a membership that goes to membership all right cool and the scholarship goes there and so a couple of things i want to get is a sign up mailing list sign up page uh we'll actually get have to get the information or a piece of the information from mailchimp because they provide a like i think a form builder in their site that you can use and that form builder will spit out whatever it spits out and then all you have to do is copy and paste that into the page itself and it should be good to go all right so if i have some additional uh i guess call out actions here i can add that here but um it looks a little bit better now that i have more items here because originally i was just thinking that there was a few items um here and it was not very much white space to be honest and i wanted a little bit more white space taken up or more things that's taken up in the white section of the page so it's good to have a little bit more content here on the home page for that um so if you come back over here uh so your jump down links work as well there like you should if you come over here so this is one of the contact pages links that i was talking about so you click that here and it goes to the contact page and all the contact information is here melon dress phone and so forth all right so scrolling through everything else still looks like it works like it should this image here i'm not sure why this image is still acting the way it's acting but it is active when the way it's acting and so um not really much i can do about that at this time but hopefully i'll get that addressed so these buttons are turning gray when i mouse over not sure if i'm okay with that let's go back over and look at so we have the secondary button class here on those um is that right yeah i got the center secondary button class on here i'm not sure if i want to keep that secondary button class or not i guess it wouldn't hurt that that's there um the worst case scenario again and probably just have to take it back off and change it to something else maybe change it to black so instead of secondary we'll change this to btn dark and if we come back up here which one did i change so the join all right so that turns black and it kind of coordinates with the buttons down here at the bottom so i guess i'll go ahead and do that with the rest so btn dart btn dark dark dark dark dark and dark there we go all right so when you mouse over now they all turn black well i forgot one oops which is fairly easy to do sometimes all right so now that one turns black all right so we are good on each of those and then it's good to see that each of these headings are lined up across even though the items above are not necessarily the same height that these second row of things are aligned because of the fact they are in a row um so going to resize this just to show you the resizing of the items so let's say you're on a phone and you're looking at this this is what it would look like so you have this navigation here and that's not centered but um and that's really not centered so that's something we have to address as well actually none of these photos are centered so uh i had to see how i can address that so that at least the center of the photo is there and it is being resized accordingly because that is not resizing like how i would like it to or it to be the carousel but these the individual heading or subsections down here on the home page they look pretty decent to me as well as the items in the footer they are sorted how i would like them to be with the copyright down at the bottom so if we click the hamburg icon and just go to the other pages and see how they look you want to check to make sure that when you're building a website that you resize it now you can use the dev tools it's the dev tools it does have a mobile setup so if you hit f12 and come over i believe it's over here there you go so and you can change it to the corresponding device that you want to use but my personal preference is just to not do it that way instead i rather take it out of mobile mode and i'd rather just resize the entire screen over here and then you're able to see it how things will look in that resized uh position and so so far everything is looking all right to me and i gotta learn that that the events goes to a different page not here all right so this page is pretty straightforward i'll probably i actually will put a heading or header graphic there just like this has a heading graphic and to complete this section here of the executive board and all the scroll bars and everything else um but what you don't want to have is a website that has a horizontal scroll bar meaning a scroll bar that goes left and right because personally i hate having to scroll left and right even when i write my code i don't have it in a way now because i have it zoomed in it's going to have the scroll bar here when i pull up this uh left sidebar but when i do that it is resized and it doesn't have a horizontal scroll bar and just to make sure my lines don't get too long to prevent that i have this character line set at roughly about i believe 80 uh characters or something like that nature or this it says a hundred and it says 111 so it's probably setting like 110 or something like that nature and that way you get a decent amount of line you know all the way across and uh it works but not so far of a line that it just keeps going and going and going because i know some people they like to write their lines as very long and they end up having to scroll left and right up and down that's very difficult in my opinion to manage it's easier if i can see like for instance this could easily span this text area could obviously run off the edge of the screen if i would have put another attribute in here as you see is right at the edge but i'd rather be able to see this entire thing on a single line i mean excuse me on a single screen versus having it on a single line but that is a prep prince that is usually determined by each developer all right yeah so let's see what page i am missing i have a photos page it'd be kind of ironic to not have a photo on the photos page maybe that's just me so let's fix that right quick so i have some existing photos in here uh let's copy we'll go with this one so we just copy it and on the photos page here we go so using our metadata image url slash images i wish we would have copied that didn't i believe this is this is this one or this one actually i'll yeah so let's copy that all right so that slash jpg and image alt all right and so now if we come back to the photo page yeah there we go and alternate text so we do view image info we got the alternate text it did not say that is it not there that is weird all right new page source if i can do that um i actually do i'm gonna do inspect element and use the inspector to so the alt tag did not show up i wonder why oh cause i mistyped alt and this atl versus alt that's a big difference all right so now there we go so we have our alt text and if we do image info oops image info there we go we have the associated text there all right f12 on that so that's good and i'm gonna have to come back and resize that image anyway because when you do the full size of that image it does blow up to mass proportion um because it's in this original size and so i need to scale it down so that when i run the speed test on this site once it is deployed to us in production environment that i get a good speed test rating a lot of times you will get a bad speed test rating not because of the number of images on the page but because the size of the emerald images like resolution size of the images are way too high like they're in their original format and so you have to scale them down otherwise your speed scores particularly for the mobile devices speed score will be very low or medium to very low desktops are usually more tolerant of that larger file size because they usually have higher connection speeds so usually a 100 megabit or even gigabit internet versus a mobile phone that does not necessarily have that type of connection speed so there's the difference in that regard that will wrap things up for this video going back tomorrow for the last part of the series where i discuss the automated deployment setup as well as do a final review of the website after it has been deployed into production until next time peace out","title":"Transcript (Unedited)"},{"location":"technology/2021.02.27-website-coding-day-7%2C-engineers-week-2021/","text":"Video Links https://github.com/almostengr/nsbe-mp.org Transcript (Unedited) continuing with the next step in the process what i'm going to be working on is to do the automated deployment now what i'm going to actually do is leverage the existing automated deployment setup that i have for my website and pretty much copy it tweak it as navy for this website that i'm building let's get into this after this intro all right what i have here is i've already set up the host name the private key and the username for this particular repository the credentials that you'll need are the credentials that you would normally use to ssh into a server the private key is what you will need to create you use the command on linux servers called ssh keygen and it will ask you a series of questions such as where you want to save the file and if you want to put a passcode with that and what you will get is two files you get a public key and a private key the public key is what will need to go on the github side and excuse me the private key is what needs to go on github which is this here the public key will need to go into your authorized keys file on the server so i've already done the step because these keys have confidential information in them you know if you're able to see the key then you can log in i did not do that step on camera if you're interested in learning how to do that uh drop a comment down below to let me know that you're interested and i could probably do that in a future video that is not as critical so that you can see the entire process from beginning to end that being said so i have all of this information here so what i'm going to do is i'm coming to the repository of my personal website and i'm just going to copy the yaml file that is in here and come over to the repository uh for this particular project and create a new folder first i need to create a folder and the way github actions work is you have to create a github folder and then underneath that folder you have to create another folder called workflows and then underneath that you will create a file that does the actual actions and you can name this file whatever you want and so i'm going to do uh let's see we'll go with uh deploy to production that's the name of the file and the file needs to end with the yml extension so i'm going to go ahead and remove the stuff that i know i don't need i also need a port number i forgot about that because the production web host does have a particular port number that is not the default port number that has to be used so i'll have to go back and add that key to add this secret to the repository and then so add that secret here and then this will work but right now it almost works it's just that part is missing okay that being said um the branch so we're going to stick with master on this one right now we're the at the time of the release of or the recording of this video uh ubuntu 20.04 is available but 18.04 is what i am using and i know works with my website as far as this script goes so i'm not going to change that you know in the future i may change it to uh when you know 1804 is not the i guess the main thing that's being used also just remove the spelling because i'm not going to do spell check on this content i want it to be able to go through if it has spelling errors uh they'll just have to be fixed when they're fixed all right and uh pretty much everything else in here is correct as is so you do a checkout of the repository you do a install of the various python 3 modules then you do a fetch so you get all of the branches that are available in the repository and then deploy do a build of the repository to the website branch and then after that you'll do a uh you'll do a log into production and then have production do a pull of the website branch and so before i do that though i'm going to have to make some adjustments on the server because right now it is looking at the main branch i believe and there are some files that have been updated so if i try to do this right now is not going to work it's going to complain that there are some issues because i saw in the logs on the server that it was complaining about trying to commit something and it did not know what commit was and it wasn't pretty error messages all right so i have my file here set up and i want this to pretty much deploy on when any branch well i only want this to deploy when the master is touched and so uh right now everything is not ready to go so i still would like it to potentially even try to build though at least just not necessarily deploy so i may create another workflow that only does build without the deploy but i only wanted to deploy from master and that's it okay so let me go over here to the commit or the version control screen and so i do need to add this particular file here and let me pull up another window that shows the commits for automating deployment to production so that it looks like i created two of the same thing all right so items 22 and item 20 the workflow file has been created okay and we'll do enter on that and the rest of that is doesn't need to be touched so we go ahead and push this up to the repository and it doesn't like that so i'm gonna have to go to the terminal and do this and that's for some reason in visual studio code sometimes i have issues with pushing up to the repository and so i have to go over to the terminal and mainly push like the ubuntu terminal not the visual studio code terminal because of the credentials that it's using it will still try to use those same credentials if i use the visual studio code terminal all right next thing up is like i mentioned i need to fix that port number so i'm going to do that off camera i have now added the port number and again i wanted to do that off camera so that you know i don't have the site being hacked and so i have all four of the secrets that i need to use and so just to talk a little bit about the secrets files if you want to have like secrets or environment variables in here uh basically you code a variable name or if you will in your github workflow and when your workflow encounters this it knows to go over to the secrets and pull that secret out and you can't see what once you put the secret in you can't see it like you need to update it or remove it but you can't do and edit so just keep that in mind that like if you're doing like a private key or something like that nature make sure you have it already staged and everything before you drop it in here because once you drop it in here it will not allow you to visualize it any further you know not be able to see it again so just keep that in mind the as far as the actions to build this site and ubuntu 18.04 it does not have the necessary packages for python 3 and thus why i'm having to run each of these python commands so i want to do the upgrade of pip but sometimes pip the depending on the docker worker that you get pip may or may not be up to date so update pip and then for mk docs you need to also have setup tools you then obviously install mk docs and install the manify plugin come to find out i don't really need the rss plug-in because i'm not using this for vlogs so i can remove that out and then i'll commit that on the next go-round the next part is that i want to do a fetch and i'm just going to uh put a name with this as well and stated that it is fetching all of the branches there we go and then going to deploy to the website branch which is doing python 3 mk docs with github deploy after that you're going to do the deploy step so if any of these steps here fail then the deploy step will not run and the way that is set up is all of these steps have to succeed before this group of steps can run and use the needs attribute for that and so i say needs mk dots and i group this set of steps as the mk docs so that's how it knows hey if this doesn't fail don't run this one uh the same set of commands are going to run you on ubuntu 18.04 and then i have a github action by fifth sky i assume that's or f if sky i don't know how you say that username um but he has a ssh action that will run a set of commands that you specify so what i have it doing is going so once it logs in it will cd and then change to the www directory and then do a get pull of the origin website branch and that is it and then it'll log out and so let me go ahead and go to the server now i need to go to the web boot directory and remember i mentioned that there's an issue with the get repository because it says something i saw in some of the logs about the commit message and i'm not sure how long this is going to take to run i see it says refreshing the index all right so i have some civic crm files and there's some other files in here that it is complaining about that i'm not too really particular of so what i'm going to do is to copy the so i'm going to go ahead and stage the existing files that is talking about and then do commit on those files all right and there we go and these additional files i believe they could also be staged as well so i'm going to do get add sites all modules cbcrm there we go i don't want to commit the settings file or that other directory because they have some database credentials and other things that i don't want out there on the open internet so i'm not going to do that added civi crm files all right and we don't we have civic crm installed but we don't use it so i like i say it's still installed here but it's not used all right so if i do a git pool like it's mentioning because my origin and master have diverged like first i'm doing get fetch and it should refresh a whole lot of stuff which it did all right now i can do a get cool well gift status and so i am on the master branch get cool and i'm going to go ahead with that merge exit get push and it sends all that back up and i don't believe there's a lot of files that it needs to push but there may be a lot of files that it needs to push uh like i said i haven't updated this site in a while because i knew that this update was going to be coming and drupal 7 which is what the site is currently running on is slated to be retired and so it's like why bother updating it if i know it's going to be retired really soon all right so for the sake of in case something goes wrong i'm going to make a backup directory and then i'm going to move the well go ahead and make a copy of sites and connect as well as sites default cbcrm over to that backup directory all right and so if i do a ls of the backup directory [Music] uh no ls of backup there we go so i have it should be two in there i think i need to la yes there we go so we have a backup of those files that i did not commit now if i do a i believe it will work now so if i go ahead and do a pull request for this repository uh in the worst case scenario i'm gonna have to come back and save some of the files but i think i have all of that covered so i'm gonna do uh not sure why it's not letting me go ahead and do that because i base that branch off of the master so the entire version history is there if i did do some enhancements and some bug fixes so we'll just go ahead and mark those two create the pull request and let's see what it does not like about this pull request so there are some conflicting files i need to [Music] all right resolve the conflicts why are there conflicting files because what i recall i deleted those files or maybe because it when i did it i probably just because i committed those files just now that might be the problem with that all right so let's follow the command line instructions and i'm going to come back to my local and do a get fetch as it's suggesting and so it really said get fetch origin but i'm already set up on the origin so there's nothing else to fetch and then get check out some already so do well i already have good status um all right so let me go ahead and whoops all right so let me go ahead and do get at this existing file uh i think that was item 20 believe it was item 20 yes items 20 and 22 and 20 pound 20 added updated workflow config gotta type it correctly work flow config all right and then do a push of that all right so that has been pushed up and it's checking obviously that issue still exists and so now we'll do uh get status to see which branch i'm on and i really i don't know if it's going to make me move these files but i don't need to necessarily commit those files so since i already have the mk dot branch checked out i can do a get so let's do get merge master um okay i already have it why didn't it not okay so get fetch all right get uh let's do get check out get check out master and be more specific get cool origin master all right get check out mk docs which is the where i put the thing is now if i do get merge master all right now i have my conflicts and so i can do get status and see the two conflicts so deleted by us so i still want to remove those files so get rm includes common and includes uh includes form dot inc all right get status and so those files have been new changes to be committed so i also want to go ahead and remove these out and so if i do [Music] a um so to get rm sites all i guess those files can go ahead and be staged and then i'll probably have to come back and uh remove those again forget status get commit without a message and it's going to automatically create a message and then you can look into the history of what it's going to do so it's going to add these files that i just recently submitted but i can come back and remove those later so that's fine with me all right so master has been merged into mk dots get status not sure why maybe do it that way um all right so now it says for step two check out master get merge dash dash no ff mk docs all right that is done get push origin master and provide my credentials all right so that has been updated should see it refresh and now that has been addressed and i can delete the mk docs branch i'm not going to do that just yet so let me go over here and check my github actions and i do have my deployment action running and so if we come over here i probably don't want to show this while it's running so wait till it gets done so come over here to the master branch and all right so i do have my mk docs branch i do have another branch in here that i attempted to redesign the website and uh i never used so while we're waiting on that action to complete i can go ahead and remove this unused branch so bye bye to that all right still waiting on a github action to complete as you see that's indicated by this yellow arrow here and if i come back over to actions um i'm not sure what all is going to output onto the screen that's why i don't want to show that right now uh but i can't show you that everything in here so i added a readme file to this particular project and also since i'm from switching technologies i guess i can go ahead and update the tags that are over here so we are no longer let's see so this site is no longer using drupal so i'm going to go ahead and remove drupal here it is non-profit we'll do a static um what was that tag let's see stem non-profit a non-profit website from google seven okay so static and static sites also static sites static site generator and then um static maybe website yep static website generation um got nsbe that is a tag or uh engineering engineering organization we'll put that there okay and so the reason i am doing it this way uh of adding these topics here is because that helps you know with this repository being able to be found and we don't have any packages we don't have releases and i'm gonna uncheck the environments too because it's designed in a way that the environments will work uh without any issues so the deployment failed and i'm sure it has something to do with the ssh keys no okay so there's a refusal to emerge unrelated histories cool all right so if i come back to the production and go to the web root directory to get status and i might have to mainly do a get check out uh no i'm sorry do get fetch uh there we go all right and it should update this master branch and maybe i need to go and update the commands that is executing on the server as well all right so now if i do a get pool and then it should update everything now there we go all right so now if i go to the website i should see the new website up and running which i don't or oh three that is never a good thing that you want to get is a 403 and just to make sure all right so it checked out the master branch which you should not have so get check out website and then from origin slash website get fetch let me see hold on this is not auto completing so that's slightly concerning get branch dash a not double a single a all right so get checkout i guess this won't do it website origin slash website [Music] that should work here shortly might take a second what i missed was the dash b command because this branch has never existed in this particular server it when it tried to do that automated deployment it failed because you can't check out a new branch and so forth and so uh yeah that made sense why it didn't work all right so now i do see my files and so if i do a refresh i should get a page yes so this site is now working in production um from the last set of videos there you probably noticed there is some changes here i did a lot of minor tweaking such as getting this carousel to not stretch the image and a number of other things on here off camera because it took it took me a while to get all that done but if you want to see all of those minor changes or how they're implemented you can easily go check the repository that contains this information and you know all of that there so now what i'm going to do is to actually go through and check to make sure that everything looks correct and so far so good there may be some minor changes that i may need to make at a later point as i can you know continue to do a deep dive but for the most part it looks like all of the links are working like they should be working and so there are no concerns with that so if you come back to the github repository i mean excuse me you come back to my local setup and i do a pool uh excuse me do a fetch not a pool all right so the 960 branch got deleted and we now have a new branch called website so at no point should you ever have to update this website branch this branch is specifically for the deployment and the static html css and javascript files what i do want to check though i think i need to check a couple of other things such as the make sure that i am using minified css and javascript files i believe i did put the minifi for well nope so it looks like i missed one here so let's reference that and then while i'm at it go ahead and open that file and do the minification on it as well as go ahead and trim this one do the arrow trim there we go to make sure and i'm also going to come back and format this uh format document there we go and trim volumetic two all right so all of that looks good all of that looks good and so if i come back over to the terminal and do a get status i do have my base html and css files that have been updated in particular the minified file and let me see just one more thing before i do a commit and push this up because this commit when i push it up will actually deploy up to the production automatically it should not have any issues so this will be another test of that before everything uh before i call this a close to the project um all right so yeah we have all the css files minified if we go down here there's a script so that's also minified so should be good to go so if you do get status status all right hit commit and we'll do i'll go ahead and close out the issue that i have open here so let me go back to the repository and so i still have open 24 and 22 and 20 23 is i'm still waiting on some more information for that one so i won't be doing that right now but that's simple when you for payment buttons you can uh depend on the platform that you're using you can get those if you're using platform like we use uh you can just go into clap paypal and request those buttons to be created enter the necessary details for those and it gives you the html code and all you gotta do is copy and paste html code into the website all right so updates completed all right get status and do get push and then i'm gonna remove these images that i did not commit to the repository out of here and that way these errors this red uh set of files so these untrack files will be removed all right so that branch has been updated so if we uh come back to the code you should see the automated deployment running which it is and so it is preparing that push and um there are some other minor tweaks that i'm probably going to have to do such as the hd access files uh get those staged in the appropriate places because one thing that i've noticed with mk docs is the mk the hidden files usually it will not deploy those to it will not consider those when you do your deployment and so what you have to do is you have to stage that file make the necessary updates stage it manually um since it won't automatically stage it for you and then just have an exclusion rule and uh on the server i believe where it ignores that if it you know encounters it or anything of that nature one other thing i'm going to also have to do i did not test this locally because i do not have php set up on this particular computer but i want to set up the uh confirm that the email setup is working correctly and that the php script that i have is working i need to implement those variables here so i will do that off camera pretty much i have the help desk email so where is it going to email this form to and i think that's pretty much it because everything else in this form because i've copied it from what i currently use is pretty much straightforward so keep in mind like i've mentioned this before but i'll mention it again when you write code especially code that you're writing on projects that you are doing for whatever personal purposes then keep in mind you know be able to reuse that code if you're building code at work you know you're not necessarily going to be able to do those things but you can kind of reference what you've already done and use that to your advantage so it's kind of a similar system scenario but you is you probably won't be able to copy your code that you're doing at your job to your personal projects but you can kind of structure it in a similar manner for that you know site to be able to achieve that same goal all right so the automated deployment did complete successfully as you see there is a green check mark here as denoted by the uh for the action that it did perform so all of those are good and so um there's no i don't think i made a significant change on here that you would actually be able to see it one thing i have considered doing is to make sure that my deployments are making making it to production without actually having to log into production and check the date and time stamps is to be able to check have a bill date somewhere in the either in the bottom of the footer or somewhere in the source code of the webpage and that way i can look at that as well as a kind of a confirmation because github will report success but sometimes that success may not actually be successful depending on if you type the wrong commands in or something of that nature so having that bill date in here would help with that confirmation but i'm not too concerned with that like if i see something that's just like really really far off then i know something's probably going array or not quite right all right that will believe we'll cover this part of the video series where we i set up the automated deployment again it's very straightforward if you want to you can copy this particular workflow file i have a link to all of this information for this entire week series of videos down in the description that way you can reference everything that you need from the description so again links in the

with the next step in the process what i'm going to be working on is to do the automated deployment now what i'm going to actually do is leverage the existing automated deployment setup that i have for my website and pretty much copy it tweak it as navy for this website that i'm building let's get into this after this intro all right what i have here is i've already set up the host name the private key and the username for this particular repository the credentials that you'll need are the credentials that you would normally use to ssh into a server the private key is what you will need to create you use the command on linux servers called ssh keygen and it will ask you a series of questions such as where you want to save the file and if you want to put a passcode with that and what you will get is two files you get a public key and a private key the public key is what will need to go on the github side and excuse me the private key is what needs to go on github which is this here the public key will need to go into your authorized keys file on the server so i've already done the step because these keys have confidential information in them you know if you're able to see the key then you can log in i did not do that step on camera if you're interested in learning how to do that uh drop a comment down below to let me know that you're interested and i could probably do that in a future video that is not as critical so that you can see the entire process from beginning to end that being said so i have all of this information here so what i'm going to do is i'm coming to the repository of my personal website and i'm just going to copy the yaml file that is in here and come over to the repository uh for this particular project and create a new folder first i need to create a folder and the way github actions work is you have to create a github folder and then underneath that folder you have to create another folder called workflows and then underneath that you will create a file that does the actual actions and you can name this file whatever you want and so i'm going to do uh let's see we'll go with uh deploy to production that's the name of the file and the file needs to end with the yml extension so i'm going to go ahead and remove the stuff that i know i don't need i also need a port number i forgot about that because the production web host does have a particular port number that is not the default port number that has to be used so i'll have to go back and add that key to add this secret to the repository and then so add that secret here and then this will work but right now it almost works it's just that part is missing okay that being said um the branch so we're going to stick with master on this one right now we're the at the time of the release of or the recording of this video uh ubuntu 20.04 is available but 18.04 is what i am using and i know works with my website as far as this script goes so i'm not going to change that you know in the future i may change it to uh when you know 1804 is not the i guess the main thing that's being used also just remove the spelling because i'm not going to do spell check on this content i want it to be able to go through if it has spelling errors uh they'll just have to be fixed when they're fixed all right and uh pretty much everything else in here is correct as is so you do a checkout of the repository you do a install of the various python 3 modules then you do a fetch so you get all of the branches that are available in the repository and then deploy do a build of the repository to the website branch and then after that you'll do a uh you'll do a log into production and then have production do a pull of the website branch and so before i do that though i'm going to have to make some adjustments on the server because right now it is looking at the main branch i believe and there are some files that have been updated so if i try to do this right now is not going to work it's going to complain that there are some issues because i saw in the logs on the server that it was complaining about trying to commit something and it did not know what commit was and it wasn't pretty error messages all right so i have my file here set up and i want this to pretty much deploy on when any branch well i only want this to deploy when the master is touched and so uh right now everything is not ready to go so i still would like it to potentially even try to build though at least just not necessarily deploy so i may create another workflow that only does build without the deploy but i only wanted to deploy from master and that's it okay so let me go over here to the commit or the version control screen and so i do need to add this particular file here and let me pull up another window that shows the commits for automating deployment to production so that it looks like i created two of the same thing all right so items 22 and item 20 the workflow file has been created okay and we'll do enter on that and the rest of that is doesn't need to be touched so we go ahead and push this up to the repository and it doesn't like that so i'm gonna have to go to the terminal and do this and that's for some reason in visual studio code sometimes i have issues with pushing up to the repository and so i have to go over to the terminal and mainly push like the ubuntu terminal not the visual studio code terminal because of the credentials that it's using it will still try to use those same credentials if i use the visual studio code terminal all right next thing up is like i mentioned i need to fix that port number so i'm going to do that off camera i have now added the port number and again i wanted to do that off camera so that you know i don't have the site being hacked and so i have all four of the secrets that i need to use and so just to talk a little bit about the secrets files if you want to have like secrets or environment variables in here uh basically you code a variable name or if you will in your github workflow and when your workflow encounters this it knows to go over to the secrets and pull that secret out and you can't see what once you put the secret in you can't see it like you need to update it or remove it but you can't do and edit so just keep that in mind that like if you're doing like a private key or something like that nature make sure you have it already staged and everything before you drop it in here because once you drop it in here it will not allow you to visualize it any further you know not be able to see it again so just keep that in mind the as far as the actions to build this site and ubuntu 18.04 it does not have the necessary packages for python 3 and thus why i'm having to run each of these python commands so i want to do the upgrade of pip but sometimes pip the depending on the docker worker that you get pip may or may not be up to date so update pip and then for mk docs you need to also have setup tools you then obviously install mk docs and install the manify plugin come to find out i don't really need the rss plug-in because i'm not using this for vlogs so i can remove that out and then i'll commit that on the next go-round the next part is that i want to do a fetch and i'm just going to uh put a name with this as well and stated that it is fetching all of the branches there we go

will not run and the way that is set up is all of these steps have to succeed before this group of steps can run and use the needs attribute for that and so i say needs mk dots and i group this set of steps as the mk docs so that's how it knows hey if this doesn't fail don't run this one uh the same set of commands are going to run you on ubuntu 18.04 and then i have a github action by fifth sky i assume that's or f if sky i don't know how you say that username um but he has a ssh action that will run a set of commands that you specify so what i have it doing is going so once it logs in it will cd and then change to the www directory and then do a get pull of the origin website branch and that is it and then it'll log out and so let me go ahead and go to the server now i need to go to the web boot directory and remember i mentioned that there's an issue with the get repository because it says something i saw in some of the logs about the commit message and i'm not sure how long this is going to take to run i see it says refreshing the index all right so i have some civic crm files and there's some other files in here that it is complaining about that i'm not too really particular of so what i'm going to do is to copy the so i'm going to go ahead and stage the existing files that is talking about and then do commit on those files all right and there we go and these additional files i believe they could also be staged as well so i'm going to do get add sites all modules cbcrm there we go i don't want to commit the settings file or that other directory because they have some database credentials and other things that i don't want out there on the open internet so i'm not going to do that added civi crm files all right and we don't we have civic crm installed but we don't use it so i like i say it's still installed here but it's not used all right so if i do a git pool like it's mentioning because my origin and master have diverged like first i'm doing get fetch and it should refresh a whole lot of stuff which it did all right now i can do a get cool well gift status and so i am on the master branch get cool and i'm going to go ahead with that merge exit get push and it sends all that back up and i don't believe there's a lot of files that it needs to push but there may be a lot of files that it needs to push uh like i said i haven't updated this site in a while because i knew that this update was going to be coming and drupal 7 which is what the site is currently running on is slated to be retired and so it's like why bother updating it if i know it's going to be retired really soon all right so for the sake of in case something goes wrong i'm going to make a backup directory and then i'm going to move the well go ahead and make a copy of sites and connect as well as sites default cbcrm over to that backup directory all right and so if i do a ls of the backup directory [Music] uh no ls of backup there we go so i have it should be two in there i think i need to la yes there we go so we have a backup of those files that i did not commit now if i do a i believe it will work now so if i go ahead and do a pull request for this repository uh in the worst case scenario i'm gonna have to come back and save some of the files but i think i have all of that covered so i'm gonna do uh not sure why it's not letting me go ahead and do that because i base that branch off of the master so the entire version history is there if i did do some enhancements and some bug fixes so we'll just go ahead and mark those two create the pull request and let's see what it does not like about this pull request so there are some conflicting files i need to [Music] all right resolve the conflicts why are there conflicting files because what i recall i deleted those files or maybe because it when i did it i probably just because i committed those files just now that might be the problem with that all right so let's follow the command line instructions and i'm going to come back to my local and do a get fetch as it's suggesting and so it really said get fetch origin but i'm already set up on the origin so there's nothing else to fetch and then get check out some already so do well i already have good status um all right so let me go ahead and whoops all right so let me go ahead and do get at this existing file uh i think that was item 20 believe it was item 20 yes items 20 and 22 and 20 pound 20 added updated workflow config gotta type it correctly work flow config all right and then do a push of that all right so that has been pushed up and it's checking obviously that issue still exists and so now we'll do uh get status to see which branch i'm on and i really i don't know if it's going to make me move these files but i don't need to necessarily commit those files so since i already have the mk dot branch checked out i can do a get so let's do get merge master um okay i already have it why didn't it not okay so get fetch all right get uh let's do get check out get check out master and be more specific get cool origin master all right get check out mk docs which is the where i put the thing is now if i do get merge master all right now i have my conflicts and so i can do get status and see the two conflicts so deleted by us so i still want to remove those files so get rm includes common and includes uh includes form dot inc all right get status and so those files have been new changes to be committed so i also want to go ahead and remove these out and so if i do [Music] a um so to get rm sites all i guess those files can go ahead and be staged and then i'll probably have to come back and uh remove those again forget status get commit without a message and it's going to automatically create a message and then you can look into the history of what it's going to do so it's going to add these files that i just recently submitted but i can come back and remove those later so that's fine with me all right so master has been merged into mk dots get status not sure why maybe do it that way um all right so now it says for step two check out master get merge dash dash no ff mk docs all right that is done get push origin master and provide my credentials all right so that has been updated should see it refresh and now that has been addressed and i can delete the mk docs branch i'm not going to do that just yet so let me go over here and check my github actions and i do have my deployment action running and so if we come over here i probably don't want to show this while it's running so wait till it gets done so come over here to the master branch and all right so i do have my mk docs branch i do have another branch in here that i attempted to redesign the website and uh i never used so while we're waiting on that action to complete i can go ahead and remove this unused branch so bye bye to that all right still waiting on a github action to complete as you see that's indicated by this yellow arrow here and if i come back over to actions um i'm not sure what all is going to output onto the screen that's why i don't want to show that right now uh but i can't show you that everything in here so i added a readme file to this particular project and also since i'm from switching technologies i guess i can go ahead and update the tags that are over here so we are no longer let's see so this site is no longer using drupal so i'm going to go ahead and remove drupal here it is non-profit we'll do a static um what was that tag let's see stem non-profit a non-profit website from google seven okay so static and static sites also static sites static site generator and then um static maybe website yep static website generation um got nsbe that is a tag or uh engineering engineering organization we'll put that there okay and so the reason i am doing it this way uh of adding these topics here is because that helps you know with this repository being able to be found and we don't have any packages we don't have releases and i'm gonna uncheck the environments too because it's designed in a way that the environments will work uh without any issues so the deployment failed and i'm sure it has something to do with the ssh keys no okay so there's a refusal to emerge unrelated histories cool all right so if i come back to the production and go to the web root directory to get status and i might have to mainly do a get check out uh no i'm sorry do get fetch uh there we go all right and it should update this master branch and maybe i need to go and update the commands that is executing on the server as well all right so now if i do a get pool and then it should update everything now there we go all right so now if i go to the website i should see the new website up and running which i don't or oh three that is never a good thing that you want to get is a 403 and just to make sure all right so it checked out the master branch which you should not have so get check out website and then from origin slash website get fetch let me see hold on this is not auto completing so that's slightly concerning get branch dash a not double a single a all right so get checkout i guess this won't do it website origin slash website [Music] that should work here shortly might take a second what i missed was the dash b command because this branch has never existed in this particular server it when it tried to do that automated deployment it failed because you can't check out a new branch and so forth and so uh yeah that made sense why it didn't work all right so now i do see my files and so if i do a refresh i should get a page yes so this site is now working in production um from the last set of videos there you probably noticed there is some changes here i did a lot of minor tweaking such as getting this carousel to not stretch the image and a number of other things on here off camera because it took it took me a while to get all that done but if you want to see all of those minor changes or how they're implemented you can easily go check the repository that contains this information and you know all of that there so now what i'm going to do is to actually go through and check to make sure that everything looks correct and so far so good there may be some minor changes that i may need to make at a later point as i can you know continue to do a deep dive but for the most part it looks like all of the links are working like they should be working and so there are no concerns with that so if you come back to the github repository i mean excuse me you come back to my local setup and i do a pool uh excuse me do a fetch not a pool all right so the 960 branch got deleted and we now have a new branch called website so at no point should you ever have to update this website branch this branch is specifically for the deployment and the static html css and javascript files what i do want to check though i think i need to check a couple of other things such as the make sure that i am using minified css and javascript files i believe i did put the minifi for well nope so it looks like i missed one here so let's reference that and then while i'm at it go ahead and open that file and do the minification on it as well as go ahead and trim this one do the arrow trim there we go to make sure and i'm also going to come back and format this uh format document there we go and trim volumetic two all right so all of that looks good all of that looks good and so if i come back over to the terminal and do a get status i do have my base html and css files that have been updated in particular the minified file and let me see just one more thing before i do a commit and push this up because this commit when i push it up will actually deploy up to the production automatically it should not have any issues so this will be another test of that before everything uh before i call this a close to the project um all right so yeah we have all the css files minified if we go down here there's a script so that's also minified so should be good to go so if you do get status status all right hit commit and we'll do i'll go ahead and close out the issue that i have open here so let me go back to the repository and so i still have open 24 and 22 and 20 23 is i'm still waiting on some more information for that one so i won't be doing that right now but that's simple when you for payment buttons you can uh depend on the platform that you're using you can get those if you're using platform like we use uh you can just go into clap paypal and request those buttons to be created enter the necessary details for those and it gives you the html code and all you gotta do is copy and paste html code into the website all right so updates completed all right get status and do get push and then i'm gonna remove these images that i did not commit to the repository out of here and that way these errors this red uh set of files so these untrack files will be removed all right so that branch has been updated so if we uh come back to the code you should see the automated deployment running which it is and so it is preparing that push and um there are some other minor tweaks that i'm probably going to have to do such as the hd access files uh get those staged in the appropriate places because one thing that i've noticed with mk docs is the mk the hidden files usually it will not deploy those to it will not consider those when you do your deployment and so what you have to do is you have to stage that file make the necessary updates stage it manually um since it won't automatically stage it for you and then just have an exclusion rule and uh on the server i believe where it ignores that if it you know encounters it or anything of that nature one other thing i'm going to also have to do i did not test this locally because i do not have php set up on this particular computer but i want to set up the uh confirm that the email setup is working correctly and that the php script that i have is working i need to implement those variables here so i will do that off camera pretty much i have the help desk email so where is it going to email this form to and i think that's pretty much it because everything else in this form because i've copied it from what i currently use is pretty much straightforward so keep in mind like i've mentioned this before but i'll mention it again when you write code especially code that you're writing on projects that you are doing for whatever personal purposes then keep in mind you know be able to reuse that code if you're building code at work you know you're not necessarily going to be able to do those things but you can kind of reference what you've already done and use that to your advantage so it's kind of a similar system scenario but you is you probably won't be able to copy your code that you're doing at your job to your personal projects but you can kind of structure it in a similar manner for that you know site to be able to achieve that same goal all right so the automated deployment did complete successfully as you see there is a green check mark here as denoted by the uh for the action that it did perform so all of those are good and so um there's no i don't think i made a significant change on here that you would actually be able to see it one thing i have considered doing is to make sure that my deployments are making making it to production without actually having to log into production and check the date and time stamps is to be able to check have a bill date somewhere in the either in the bottom of the footer or somewhere in the source code of the webpage and that way i can look at that as well as a kind of a confirmation because github will report success but sometimes that success may not actually be successful depending on if you type the wrong commands in or something of that nature so having that bill date in here would help with that confirmation but i'm not too concerned with that like if i see something that's just like really really far off then i know something's probably going array or not quite right all right that will believe we'll cover this part of the video series where we i set up the automated deployment again it's very straightforward if you want to you can copy this particular workflow file i have a link to all of this information for this entire week series of videos down in the description that way you can reference everything that you need from the description so again links in the

(Unedited)"},{"location":"technology/2021.03.02-coding-challenge-fizz-buzz-with-.net-core/","text":"Video Links Mentioned Coding Challenge Repository Transcript (Unedited) what's going on good people so this video will be another coding challenge this coding challenge will be doing the fizz buzz you've probably heard of this one before uh believe it or not i've actually done this in an interview before i think it had different words with it but it was still the same concept without further ado let's go ahead and jump it right into it [Music] all right so here is the coding challenge for this video and it is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 or for multiples of 3 print fizz instead of the number and for multiples of 5 print buzz for multiples which are for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print fizz buzz that being said uh is pretty straightforward as you see there's an example here so let's go ahead and get right into it as like with the last coding challenge i will be doing this in net core and all right so now that my system is decided to start responding once again um what i'm going to do is i'm going to open a new actually i need to create a new project i've created a repository with all of these coding challenges in it so a link to that repository will be down in the description below if you've missed a previous coding challenge all that code will be in the same repository i figured i would put all of these coding challenges into the same repository that way um they have a central location for where they can be easily found all right so i'm going to create a new project so again using the.net core we're going to do net new console and we're going to give it a name of fizzbuzz all right and that should create a new folder called fizzbuzz as well as set up everything we need for the project so if we cd into that directory we have our project now let's go ahead and create a uh get ignore file for this particular directory that way we don't commit our project files such as the actual executables to the repository now that we have done that we can go into visual studio code into the appropriate directory and open the project that we just created from the command line and then we can open our program.cs i'm going to update the namespace to customize it to my particular setup or how i prefer to do things and i'm also going to remove the hello world out of here and it wants to reboot through the assets required so we'll go ahead and click yes on that and now so we have a program that prevents prints the numbers from 1 to 100 so what i will do is to create a for loop we'll do it i starting with 1 and while i is less than or equal to 100 we will increment i um this is your basic for loop and this for loop replies to regardless of what language that you're doing um the next step so we need to determine whether the number that we're currently on is a multiple of three a multiple of five or a multiple of three and five so the way i'm going to do this is to do a uh we'll call it a string with output and we'll set it to an empty string and then if i is divisible by three then we will add to that string fizz all right and uh also do i know you're thinking well should you do it else if no so what i'm going to do is i is divisible by 5 then whoa all right we'll do an output of we'll do plus equals here buzz and looks like i'm missing some quotes all right and let's see if i okay i think i may have missed done this so if we do i divided by five and that equals zero that should work maybe i have the wrong type of slash there we go all right so i had the wrong slash on there all right and so what we're doing is we're basically doing division so if i divided by 3 equals 0 which i don't think this is quite right i want to use the modulus operator but it seems to be complaining about the modulus operator so we'll go modu modu lust operator c sharp all right and so we'll go to the internet and kind of look into this a little bit further to make sure we're actually using the right thing um because what i want is so let's see ah okay so we want is we want to do the modulus so we want the modulus is basically the uh mathematical representation of the remainder so when you're discussing um so let's say if you have 15 15 divided by three would be five with a remainder of zero and so that's where the modulus comes in and so uh i i think originally when i was typing this i did have the i percent three but i didn't have the equation of what to check and so it kind of flagged that let's see if we go back here um yeah so i didn't like that because it couldn't convert that type so this is actual condition so it can convert that and so the reason i'm doing it this way is because i want the fizz buzz to be able to show up so you have to do it in a certain way like i mentioned i've done this in as an interview question once before um so it took me a little bit moment but once i worked with the interviewer and discussed some things then we did get it correct and uh outputted all right so now that we have our fizz buzz portions what i want to do next is check to see if the output length is greater than zero and if it is then well excuse me correction let's do this so we want to do if the output link is equal to zero which means that none of these conditions were returned true then we want to set the output equal to the i dot tostring value and then we want to console.writeline uh the value of output all right and so don't want to remove too many braces so if we do format and trim if i run this in the terminal and it may ask me to do some other stuff before it actually runs off maybe not all right so it is building it is now running there we go all right so we have one two and if we come and pull up our image to kind of do a comparison so we have one two fizz four buzz is seven eight fist buzz 11 is 13 14 fizz buzz and that's where our example stops at but the pattern continues forward where it does the fizz buzz so let's come back to this code and do a little bit more elaborate walkthrough so we're basically we're do looping over the numbers one through 100 and we're initializing every time we start with another number we're going to set the output value to a empty string which is this here just two votes with nothing in the middle and then we're going to check to see if the number is divisible by 3 and if so does it have a remainder if it does have a remainder it will not output it will not add fizz to the output if it is if it does not have a remainder it will set that to the remainder will be zero then it will add fizz to the output then here we're going to do the same thing as we did for three but we're checking for five instead and this time since we already we may have fizz in the previous check we want to if this condition is true we want to add buzz to the output so we're going to do the plus equals operator now this operator is the same as if you were to do output equals output plus buzz all right as soon as i can get it type so that's the this condition is the same as this condition this is just a more concise way of typing this same statement all right and then the last check will be if the output length so the length of this variable is equal to zero which the length by default would be zero then we know that it does not have a fizz or a buzz contained in it and so based off of that we can set the number equal to i mean excuse me we said the output equal to the number that was currently being done in that for loop and then the last part is to print out that number to the console all right and so uh that being said i'll run it once more again just so you're able to see it um if you have any questions regarding this particular project drop those down in the comments below a link to the repository where you can find the source code for this will be available also and until next time peace out oh and well as you see it ran successfully again the 99 100 there you go all right peace out","title":"Coding Challenge Fizz Buzz with .NET

into whether it was possible to write commit messages without actually commiting files. Come to find out, it is possible. You're probably thinking, why would one want to do this? There are couple reasons that I could come up with. Use Cases Trigger CI/CD One of the most common reasons to do this is so that you can trigger the CI/CD workflow after a failed run. In some situations, a run may fail for reasons other than the code. For instance, a server may not be responding or is offline. You're probably saying, just go in the workflow tool (Jenkins, DevOps, GitHub Actions) and manually trigger the work flow. In some set ups, only certain individuals are allowed to trigger workflows manually, such as system admins or team managers. Access control is a big thing, especially in larger organizations. Updating Issues / User Stories In my case, I have been trying to be more proactive about closing the GitHub Issues with commit messages instead of using comments on the issues themselves. Why is that the case? Because it associates the issue with the commit. Having the issue associated with the commit is helpful when tracing when bugs or defects were introduced into the code. How To Commit Without Files If you try to do a commit without adding files first, then you will get the below output: almostengineer@aeoffice:~/ubuntu-automation/git_scripts$ git commit -m \"my commit message\" On branch main Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) As you see, git will tell you that there is nothing to track and thus nothing to commit to the repository. Normally when you do a commit, you run git add followed by git commit . However, since there are no files to commit, you skip the git add command and only do the commit. Here's the command that you run to do a commit without any files: git commit --allow-empty -m \"My commit message\" Let's break down the command. The git commit and -m \"My commit message\" are familiar to you if you do your commits via the command line like how I do mine. The part --allow-empty is probably what you are not familiar with. This part is the argument that has to be passed in so that you can do a commit without any files. Looking at the documentation with \"git commit --help\", it says --allow-empty Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole parent commit is a mistake, and the command prevents you from making such a commit. This option bypasses the safety, and is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts. As you see, this is why when you try to do a commit without adding files first, that you get the error message mentioned above. Conclusion I plan on using this going forward when I miss closing issues or user stories with previous commits. I probably will not being using it to trigger workflows as I have access to my personal CI/CD pipeline tools and can trigger them manually when need be.","title":"Commit Without Files"},{"location":"technology/2021.03.04-commit-without-files/#use-cases","text":"","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"technology/2021.03.04-commit-without-files/#trigger-cicd","text":"One of the most common reasons to do this is so that you can trigger the CI/CD workflow after a failed run.

Here's the command that you run to do a commit without any files: git commit --allow-empty -m \"My commit message\" Let's break down the command. The git commit and -m \"My commit message\" are familiar to you if you do your commits via the command line like how I do mine. The part --allow-empty is probably what you are not familiar with. This part is the argument that has to be passed in so that you can do a commit without any files. Looking at the documentation with \"git commit --help\", it says --allow-empty Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole parent commit is a mistake, and the command prevents you from making such a commit. This option bypasses the safety, and is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts. As you see, this is why when you try to do a commit without adding files first, that you get the error message mentioned above.","title":"How To Commit Without Files"},{"location":"technology/2021.03.04-commit-without-files/#conclusion","text":"I plan on using this going forward when I miss closing issues or user stories with previous commits.

Links Mentioned Coding Challenge Repository Transcript (Unedited) what's going on good people this video will be a coding challenge video the challenge is actually a little bit more difficult than what i'm used to this particular challenge is to create a hangman game and as you see here there is some criteria of the to do items and pretty much what the objective is on how to build out this game this core example starts off with python but of course like in convention we will do this in c-sharp using.net core let's get into it all right i have visual studio code already pulled up and all of the existing or prior coding challenges are available on github in a repo called coding challenge link will be provided to that repository to get started we're going to create a net core console application and i'm going to name it hang hangman no sense of overcomplicating the name and once that project is created i'm going to go into the hangman directory and dot net core uh get ignore and that's going to create a get ignore file uh oh sorry i forgot the new keyword so it's dot net new cool dot net new get ignore mess that up too all right let's try this one more time dot net new get ignored all right there we go so next i'm going to open the repository or excuse me open the project and i'm going to create the programs here open the program cs file and then we're going to remove this statement as well as update the namespace to my personal convention uh you can update the namespace to your particular convention if you have one for your applications and while we're at it we're gonna go ahead and let visual studio code build out the necessary files to build and launch the application all right next thing up is we're going to take the word list that is provided in the example code over here and we're going to type it in here um let's see if we can get both of these kind of yeah that works all right and the word list is an array now mind you this is in python so i'm going to stick with an array with this but i'm going to name the variables according to the c sharp syntax so we got aardvark got baboon got camel and that will be the end of that and then we have our to do one which randomly choose a word from the word list and assign it to a variable uh let's see if we can stretch this out a little bit or assign it to a variable called chosen word all right to do two says to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess and that probably should be in quotation marks make guess i think that's the non-quotation mark version of it lowercase and to do number three says to check if the letter the user guest with the guess in parentheses is one of the letters in the chosen word all right so a little bit complex a lot of comparisons that will have to be done to make this doable um i'm gonna go ahead and make this wrap so i don't have that horizontal scroll bar and that should be it okay i'm gonna do format and we'll trim any trailing spaces before we get started that being said we need to randomly choose a word from chosen word so we're going to create a random object and using the random class we will place that there and then we need to get a random and i misspelled answer here we will need to get one of these three words at random from the list so we will call a integer or define a integer wordless [Music] ant i think that's we'll stick with that name may not be the best name for it but we'll stick with it and we'll do a random dot next with zero being the lowest number and the max being word list dot leave this link yes all right and so that make sure that and this here will ensure that the wordless.length that is will ensure that we are not getting a word that is outside of the index of the array that is defined up here on line 9. next we need to assign the word to a variable called chosen word so create a string called chosen word and set it equal to word list with word list ant embraces and that will get aardvark baboon and i misspelled baboon babin isn't i don't believe is a word but it might be hard baboon and camel will be placed into the chosen word item all right task number two is to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess make guess lower case so we're going to do a string of inputs input is equal to console dot three line and we're gonna check that to to lower and we're going to up here console.writeline and set this to enter a letter there we go all right and make it lower case so we've done that and the variable needs to go into actually it needs to go into guess instead of into a input and since it does say one letter what we could do is actually use a char called guess and because chart will only hold one letter or number or character and so that will minimize and make this a little bit easier to manage to get um so it does not like that so we may have to take this to lower out so let's go ahead and do that there and then uh really okay so uh well maybe not since it does not like that being done that way unless i can convert this read line to a char which i do not believe is possible i can do a char array and then get the first item out of that array so i may do that instead um yeah so to get the chart array and then we'll put that into a um char open close and then that'll be called yes that should be sufficient and then for each um var guess letter we're going to guest letter in guess we're going to do and actually that may not be the right way to do that so we'll do for it i equals 0 i less than um guess dot length i plus plus technically you should only be accepting one letter in here um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take whatever the user types in but then what i'm gonna do is actually only handle or process the first character that's in the full input so if they type 50 characters i'm only going to count the first one and that will prevent it from trying to compare a lot at once or um having too many values trying to come through at once all right so we want the first item out and so we want to set the we also want to change this lowercase because that's the other thing that we have to do with this so guess i equals um guess i dot two doesn't have a two lower case on here which is uh i believe is because the lower case only applies to a string and so what may have to do is to temporarily convert this to a string and make it lower case then set it back to a car [Music] so we'll create a string uh for now and then do temp equals temp dot to lower there we go and then we will set the oh and also need to convert this dot to string and then let's see can we do guess i is equal to temp i may have to do converts on this one dot char 2 char yeah and [Music] no it's not what i want convert dot sh [Music] oh i had to convert the um so temp dot string all right two two string two char array i'm sorry all right so now that we've converted everything back from upper to lower we converted back to our array and this may not actually even need to be done this way um because [Music] we're trying to do a single charge to a whole thing that may be a problem so i need to do a um let's do a char array that is actually so if i read this and then do temp plus equals now that resets every time so that's not going to work all right so i need a temp string outside of this yes so we'll do temp there do a temporary thing here set that to no value actually set that to an empty string to start with and then yes i said to string equals 10 plus equals temp and no actually i need to change that to a lower and then add it to the variable and then outside of that to attempt to back to guess and handle that so uh essentially this for loop will loop over every item in the array in the character or the guess array and from that change all of the values to lowercase equivalence and then turn around and put that into the char array i'm thinking that's probably the best route to do this may actually want to change this up though to be honest because it probably doesn't need to be a char array probably just needs to be just getting the first one so if we get the first um item out of here and put that in then we won't need to convert everything we just need to convert the zero index uh assuming that the zero index is well assuming that there's something that has been typed in because if there's nothing that's been typed in then that doesn't matter um so we can just do that instead of looping through the entire list of items so we'll do a string temp let's move this here and change adjust the indents um better yet i'm thinking well since we're only supposed to store the guess and that variable name guess um what i'm gonna do is leave that there so we'll call this a uh char i can't change a chart to a chart array so we'll change it to a string for the um wait guess and no so we'll call this input then we'll do input of zero is assigned to the string guess and then from here yes equals guess dot to lower and we can do away with that now that seems to be a little bit more simplified for what we're trying to do all right so now that we have the first character out of our string we actually probably want to check to make sure that the string is actually has a value here so i want to do input dot length is greater well yeah greater than zero then we want to do the stuff inside the if condition otherwise when you go to run this and the length is equal to zero then it will throw an exception for an index out of bounds and so obviously knowing that you don't want to code that in all right so that should do that particular part all right so the to do for number three is to check if the letter the user guest is one of the letters in the chosen word so to do that we'll do if um chosen word dot contains and guess yes okay and actually guest needs to come outside of this uh if statement so we'll do string guess equals to an empty string and so if that contains then console right line the letter you guess is contained in the word all right and obviously there's some more logic that needs to go in here um but i'm just putting these statements here for now so that we know what should go in each of these statements the letter and then i can do a uh the replacement string here is not contained in the word and then we'll do guess as that value then we'll come back up here guess and letter there we go is contained in the word got it all right so now that we have this existing logic well this logic in place what we want to do is to go ahead and build it and make sure that what we have is running thus far and also that it will build thus far but you will know though is that this will not repeat um once i put a letter in so if i type a letter um we'll do a capital p and for some reason i have issues with this working in visual studio code so let me open a terminal and run this application all right so i want to do dot net run from here and it should present the same information of asking for a letter to be entered i'm gonna do an uppercase p and it says the letter p is not contained in the word um we do not know which word that it picked so we probably want to add that piece of information to the output as well as the application uh that we're running because that's not also being output so we'll say welcome to hangman will be a capital h and we want to say [Music] all right so we have the chosen word so we can do console.writeline and say that the word has and we'll do a replacement there characters and with that we'll do chosen word dot length for the substitution value so now if we come back over to our terminal and run this again before enter a letter shows up on the screen it should say the word that we're looking for and so given that we only have three words it's pretty obvious which word that we're looking for and so the last time we typed p and we confirmed that p was not in the word uh whichever word it was but this time we actually know where it was which word it is because we can see the words and so we can type a letter in here uh we'll go ahead and type a and actually i'm going to type uppercase a just to make sure that the lowercase comparison is doing correctly and so the letter a is contained in the word and as you see it also dropped the lowercase or got the lowercase equivalent of that so that is working i did notice that the punctuation was missing so i'm going to add that in right now while i see it all right now we need this to continue to loop over instead of exiting like it's currently doing so what i'm gonna do is to include a while loop and i'm going to wrap that while loop around this to do and for starters i'm gonna just default it to true just so that the error messages go away but i'm actually going to fix that here shortly so that it um only actually is a legit while loop condition and so what we need to do is that we need to normally in hangman you have a number of tries so to do this number of tries you need to find a variable that does the number of tries or counts the number of tries we're going to call the int tries spelling this are uh yeah we call it entries and um or guess attempts would probably be more appropriate and we're going to initialize that to seven and then so while guess attempts is greater than zero because once you hit zero then you're out and we want to see that if the guess is not uh if the word is not correct then we want to remove the guess remove one of the guest attempts okay so since we also have the guest attempts we'll want to print the number of guesses remaining to the screen so we'll do console.writeline remaining attempts and we'll do the placement of the variable in there and semicolon and actually i'm go ahead and rename this to remaining attempts because it seems i'm trying to get away from using the same uh variable because we already have guess as a variable down here so when it comes to typing you'll try to make your variables fairly distinct that way if you have for example if you have string guess 2 well when you go to type somewhere down here guess it's going to auto auto excuse me it's going to uh use the intellisense and intellisense is going to throw whichever one it thinks you might be trying to type which in most scenarios for me uh doesn't necessarily make it to the correct one so i'm going to rename that for that reason all right now if we um come over here and run this and it will build all right so we have all the information welcome to hey man the word has six characters and enter a letter so we have let's say we're looking for t letter t is not contained in the word and as we also see the remaining attempt has dropped down by one to six and if we keep doing this and if you don't put anything in there the remaining attempts remains the same which is what we want um letter is not contained in the word and if we exit the loop we need to put a condition there that checks to see what happens after we exit the loop because there should be two conditions where you exit the loop if you run out of attempts or if you get the word correct so right now we're working on the attempts portion all right so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and we want to console.writeline you have ran out of attempts you lose and i know that's kind of a crude error uh it's a crude message but that's essentially what has happened all right that being said um the next part we can work on is actually doing the comparisons for if the guess is contained in the word so how do we do that um so we need to get the uh we need to also be able to display the word to which is a little bit complex um but i'm thinking we probably need to do the display in a separate function so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna build it out within this if condition and then take that statement once it's built out in if condition and move it over to a function where that would make sense and so i'm gonna go ahead and move this over to a function as well so we're going to extract a i believe it's extract method so that will take that to a separate method and [Music] pass that in and so if we come back up here and say exit game as the name of the function and we'll put all of the stuff that needs to be printed out to the screen inside of this exit game function and therefore you get a more concise uh loop and or main we'll continue that a little bit further and then um we could also leverage some class variables here too because we're using this function instead of passing these arguments in so what i'm going to do is actually make this remaining attempt into a [Music] if it'll let me do a cut it's not a constant um well one move it near the reference because it doesn't make sense that it's that far up uh all right now let's see if it'll let me do a not letting me do it so i'm just gonna have to force my way to do it we're going to declare a static variable with that in it all right and therefore if i have a static variable i do not need to pass the value in because the function the variable is because it's in the class it now knows what it is and so i don't have to do that um but that also means any function outside of domain can modify this value which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you're writing your code but it's fine in this case all right so now that we have our remaining temps configured correctly um the next step is to handle the correct guesses so we have it checking that if the letter is there then that is correct so we need to do a comparison of the we also need to track the letters that we already have guessed so let's do a um i want to declare another thing i want to declare another string array that says already guest letters and actually no that can't be an array so it have to be a list and the reason being that it would have to be a list is because that if it is an array that array will not uh hold the values in place so what i need to do is to do list of not word lists string and we'll call it already guest letters equals new list of string [Music] and we need to import a collection statement there for that which is [Music] system.collections.generic and let's see what else all right so we have that so we want to anytime we type a letter in we want to add that to the list of already guest letters so we're going to do already guess letters dot add and we want to add after we drop it to the lower case or convert it to lowercase then we want to add it to guess or add guess to it excuse me all right and let's see so that is correct um one other thing that i noticed that i probably want to go ahead and make it a little bit more difficult to make this a problem in the future is so the word list is already lower case but let's say somebody comes up in here and types a capital a in here instead well then we still wanted to remain lower case so i'm gonna do dot two lower on this uh setting of the word to chosen word that way that ensures that even if somebody does type a uppercase letter here that it is handled properly all right so we're adding our already guessed letters to the list and then we need to do a comparison of the already guessed letters versus the um not already guess letters what i'm thinking so um let me change this back for the sake of uh the way it should have been and already guessed letters so i want to i think we need to do a for loop on um you probably also need a variable up here that call uh that is a string that is called visible letters and we'll set that to that and then we want to set the divisible letters equal to wait 1 2 a 4 each var letter [Music] in uh actually no yeah before each in chosen word we want to set visible letters plus equals to star and that will be our masking of the letters um trying to think is that the correct that may or may not be the correct way to do it but this is one way that you can do this what i'm thinking is we may just need to cycle through each of the letters and if the letter has not already been guessed then that letter is replaced in the output before it is displayed to the screen and that way we know which letter um we don't have to keep track of the word in multiple well we may still need to do it in multiple variables won't be as difficult all right so let's see oh for each letter in chosen word uh or for each um yeah so for each letter um in already guessed honestly we want to start with the letters that are already visible and create a temporary string that will set so we'll do a um call a string display word set that the empty and then for each letter in chosen word we will do a comparison so if letter is equal to letter let's see no if trying to think already guess letters dot contains and then letter then and we'll make that a if statement i've already guessed letters contains letter uh with the letter passed in is that correct then we will add letter to the output so we'll call this uh or display so display word plus equals letter and if it does not else we'll do display word plus equals asterix and i think that's the proper way of doing that um what is wrong with this letter can i convert char to string got it so convert that to string with the parentheses that should handle that all right and so let's see what this does i want to remove this for the time being because i know i'm not going to need it and we'll come back over to our terminal window do clear and then do dot net run all right the variable visible letters is never used hmm okay that's fine i noticed i misspelled it too so uh we'll comment that out for the time being as well all right so our letter excuse me our word has eight letters uh we will have seven attempts enter a letter um so let's do an o all right so o is not included in the word six remaining attempts now i noticed something that the display is not printing out which it should be so that is a problem so let's move the display word um the display word needs to be reset every time it also needs to be visible where it could be fined [Music] so this way word contains guess as i'm looking at this i think i actually have the same condition in here or than i should because the same function is going to be called in either scenario [Music] and i need the display word to be kept in between cycles um so we'll do display word and i need another console right line because what i want to have happen is see how these are all crammed up right next to each other i don't want that to happen so what i'm gonna do is to after each attempt um so remaining attempts is six remaining attempts remaining attempts so i'm gonna add another console.writeline and just put a blank line there actually i don't even need quotes there just do it empty and that should do the same thing all right um now you could do all kinds of other kind of formatting like separating it with equals or not i'm keeping it simple so blank line will do in this particular case all right so now that we have guest letters and so chosen word contains yes then um and we may need to change this logic all together may rather need to do it this way instead of the other way um i'll leave it there for now all right so we need to reset this way word each time we come through and guess the right thing so what i'm gonna do is do display word it's equal to empty string um because if you keep appending to it then it won't be pretty after the second go around and at the end of the loop need to do console dot writeline and display work and that should be that all right so let's try this again clear the terminal run the application and let it build so now we have our space there so let's go ahead and type and oh all right so the letter o is not contained in the word got it so let's type in a it's still not printing my the actual word so that is a problem because it should be still displaying actual words so we may need to copy this here and put this there all right so let's exit and try that run again oops close ring let's run again let's put the letter o all right so now we're getting our word here so let's put the letter a and see what happens all right so we got the letter a and our attempts remained the same that's correct so we put the letter d we got our d what is it aardvark goes r we got our r and then we got a k and a v and we've spelled our word now only thing is a display word is the same as the actual contained word but we don't have a condition in our loop that would exit out that being said so we need to do if remaining attempts is greater than zero and if display word is not equal to uh nachos yeah chosen word i believe this is the correct way of doing this and then so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and then i want to put another statement here and have it say it could be an else statement here but i'm gonna do it this way if display and i don't have display word there so i probably will use an else statement here just to simplify this so if you're exiting the game that means you've done one or two things you've either gotten it wrong or you've gotten it right right line so you have won the game um and say you have yeah you have won the game that should be sufficient all right so coming back over here let's do a clear dot that run and hopefully this time uh get it right so our six letter word in our example is baboon so we can put a capital t in here for the sake of it and the letter t is not contained in the word now one thing we did not test but it should still work is if we put a number or a special character and i know you can't make letters and numbers out of special characters and there is a way to check that and make that possible but for the sake of this we are not going to add that logic we pretty much figure out if you put something in here that you shouldn't put in it's not going to work or it will be wrong so i put a pound sign in here and the letter pound granted that's not a letter um so we may need to change that output statement is not contained in a word so now that we have that there and i'm noticing something here is the original word has six asterisks here now this word has six plus six which is 12. so the condition to uh if your word is wrong is not doing something correct now i believe it's because it's not resetting the display word here so we needed to reset the display word regardless of where it's at so we need to move it up to here instead and i'm going to comment that out for the time being and then this here really needs to be a function because it is the same logic for both statements so i'm just going to go ahead and select that now do control dot and do extract method and so we're going to call this method um check this way i guess we call it um not check display let's see uh [Music] process display word all right and i know that's a mouthful but essentially that is what it's doing and so since this is the same as this down here it's going to go ahead and copy paste that there format and trim and then save so if we go back to our terminal and we'll try to run this again and make sure that that is correct all right so we have a five letter word a five-letter word in this example is camel so camel does not have an r in it so if we type r uh we get our five asterisks which we still should still have and then also have one less remaining attempt camel does have an m and we'll put it uppercase m in here for the sake of it it still should pass and it does and we still have six remaining c a let's do uh q for the sake of just because and e l camel so we have gotten the word and we have won the game um now if you want to you can take this a little bit further and actually do the drawing of the hangman part um i mentioned that earlier but i probably won't do that on this particular video because of the fact of drawing characters or ascii characters does take a little bit of effort um so let's walk back through the code one more time before we close out the video all right so we have our welcome to hangman opening here um we have our word list this word list can be longer just add more animals so dog you gotta do it in quotation marks dog elephants um ferrets uh efg so um giraffe there we go all right so we have one letter for the first one two three four five six seven letters of the alphabet that should be sufficient and then we did our two do one which is randomly choose a word from the list and assign it to a variable called chosen word so that's what we've done with these four lines here um we've had to add some additional variables here because of the fact we need to have those for our while loop and we also added the uh remaining attempts so that you know how many times you have remaining before you lose the game and then enter a letter so we need that information to prompt to the user for what for them to do something then you take that guess and process it accordingly get the first letter out of there if they put multiple characters in there it is possible you could handle that but for the sake of simplicity in this example we're only going to handle that with the by grabbing the first letter out of this string and do already guess letters with ad and um i actually come think of it i may actually have made a mistake i realize this condition may actually take [Music] um an error message i mean excuse me blank string and decrement the steps or decrement the remaining attempts but we'll have to test that again so already guess letters you add that to the guest the letters that have been guessed and then if the word is chosen contains the guess then that letter is contained in the word and we will process the display word so that is a number of arguments that are passed in and you loop over each letter in the chosen word and to see if that's there and so if if it is there you display that letter if not you show an asterisk in its place and then return this back to the caller um and then inside of that that would be it if you're doing this same set of stuff inside of the else condition you would decrement the remaining attempts and you would display the word uh regardless of you know asterisk letter combinations or just asterisks only once you get done with the while loop you will exit the game and that exit game comes down here and it determines whether you had zero remaining attempts and if you did have zero remaining attempts that means you ran out of attempts and you have lost the game um if you have remaining attempts that means you have won the game and one thing you probably want to also do here is do a console.right line and say the word was and then print out what the word was so um because usually if you lose you find out what the word is and so what we want to do is we'll probably have to set chosen word as so i set that one as a class variable i don't know if i want to do that well i'll go ahead and pass that in here as a class variable so um string um the word that's what i'll call this one here we'll wrong function all right so that there so therefore if you run out of attempts you do still find out what the word is and so now that we made that one adjustment let's do uh net run one final time so we have seven a seven character seven character word and seven remaining attempts so to enter a letter we're gonna do uh we'll put an h in there the letter h is not contained in the word um so most of the words if not mistaken all of the words well most of the words have the letter a so we can put a letter a in there all right so the letter a is in the word and i think i know what the word is based off what i've already entered letter g i r a f and there's two of those and we're gonna intentionally run out of letters even though we're so close and i kind of noticed something that well that's working correctly so if you put the same letter in twice uh as you see here i have a and i already had a in the previous go around it does not count off against your attempts because that letter already existed so that's something to keep in mind normally if you already guess a letter that's already been guessed then you have a output that says that letter has already been guessed and that logic can be added in here too as a if condition all right so continuing on let's finish out so that we run out of attempts and just gotta make sure i type letters all right so here we have it you have ran out of attempts you lose the word was giraffe and as you can kind of figure out that's kind of what it was based off the other guesses so that wraps that up for this video this video took a little bit longer than the previous coding sessions all the coding sessions won't necessarily be quick but um yeah this one hopefully you have learned a little bit um i know there are some video tutorials on hey this can be done in 10 minutes and more than likely those 10 minute videos are because of the fact they've already practiced it a number of times and they're just regurgitating that on video to have it done in a concise manner as you can see it took a decent amount of time and a lot of walking it through to get it to do what it needs to do so while you see those tutorials that may say i can do this in five minutes i can do it in 10 minutes actuality they probably practice it two or three times beforehand and then was able to go back and record it in the five to 10 minutes that you actually ended up seeing so any questions drop those in the comments this will probably not be the last of the coding challenges that i face and uh want to share with you so any questions comments comments uh the repository information will be provided so you can look at the source code for this until next time peace out","title":"Coding Challenge Create Hangman

coding challenge video the challenge is actually a little bit more difficult than what i'm used to this particular challenge is to create a hangman game and as you see here there is some criteria of the to do items and pretty much what the objective is on how to build out this game this core example starts off with python but of course like in convention we will do this in c-sharp using.net core let's get into it all right i have visual studio code already pulled up and all of the existing or prior coding challenges are available on github in a repo called coding challenge link will be provided to that repository to get started we're going to create a net core console application and i'm going to name it hang hangman no sense of overcomplicating the name and once that project is created i'm going to go into the hangman directory and dot net core uh get ignore and that's going to create a get ignore file uh oh sorry i forgot the new keyword so it's dot net new cool dot net new get ignore mess that up too all right let's try this one more time dot net new get ignored all right there we go so next i'm going to open the repository or excuse me open the project and i'm going to create the programs here open the program cs file and then we're going to remove this statement as well as update the namespace to my personal convention uh you can update the namespace to your particular convention if you have one for your applications and while we're at it we're gonna go ahead and let visual studio code build out the necessary files to build and launch the application all right next thing up is we're going to take the word list that is provided in the example code over here and we're going to type it in here um let's see if we can get both of these kind of yeah that works all right and the word list is an array now mind you this is in python so i'm going to stick with an array with this but i'm going to name the variables according to the c sharp syntax so we got aardvark got baboon got camel and that will be the end of that and then we have our to do one which randomly choose a word from the word list and assign it to a variable uh let's see if we can stretch this out a little bit or assign it to a variable called chosen word all right to do two says to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess and that probably should be in quotation marks make guess i think that's the non-quotation mark version of it lowercase and to do number three says to check if the letter the user guest with the guess in parentheses is one of the letters in the chosen word all right so a little bit complex a lot of comparisons that will have to be done to make this doable um i'm gonna go ahead and make this wrap so i don't have that horizontal scroll bar and that should be it okay i'm gonna do format and we'll trim any trailing spaces before we get started that being said we need to randomly choose a word from chosen word so we're going to create a random object and using the random class we will place that there and then we need to get a random and i misspelled answer here we will need to get one of these three words at random from the list so we will call a integer or define a integer wordless [Music] ant i think that's we'll stick with that name may not be the best name for it but we'll stick with it and we'll do a random dot next with zero being the lowest number and the max being word list dot leave this link yes all right and so that make sure that and this here will ensure that the wordless.length that is will ensure that we are not getting a word that is outside of the index of the array that is defined up here on line 9. next we need to assign the word to a variable called chosen word so create a string called chosen word and set it equal to word list with word list ant embraces and that will get aardvark baboon and i misspelled baboon babin isn't i don't believe is a word but it might be hard baboon and camel will be placed into the chosen word item all right task number two is to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess make guess lower case so we're going to do a string of inputs input is equal to console dot three line and we're gonna check that to to lower and we're going to up here console.writeline and set this to enter a letter there we go all right and make it lower case so we've done that and the variable needs to go into actually it needs to go into guess instead of into a input and since it does say one letter what we could do is actually use a char called guess and because chart will only hold one letter or number or character and so that will minimize and make this a little bit easier to manage to get um so it does not like that so we may have to take this to lower out so let's go ahead and do that there and then uh really okay so uh well maybe not since it does not like that being done that way unless i can convert this read line to a char which i do not believe is possible i can do a char array and then get the first item out of that array so i may do that instead um yeah so to get the chart array and then we'll put that into a um char open close and then that'll be called yes that should be sufficient and then for each um var guess letter we're going to guest letter in guess we're going to do and actually that may not be the right way to do that so we'll do for it i equals 0 i less than um guess dot length i plus plus technically you should only be accepting one letter in here um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take whatever the user types in but then what i'm gonna do is actually only handle or process the first character that's in the full input so if they type 50 characters i'm only going to count the first one and that will prevent it from trying to compare a lot at once or um having too many values trying to come through at once all right so we want the first item out and so we want to set the we also want to change this lowercase because that's the other thing that we have to do with this so guess i equals um guess i dot two doesn't have a two lower case on here which is uh i believe is because the lower case only applies to a string and so what may have to do is to temporarily convert this to a string and make it lower case then set it back to a car [Music] so we'll create a string uh for now and then do temp equals temp dot to lower there we go and then we will set the oh and also need to convert this dot to string and then let's see can we do guess i is equal to temp i may have to do converts on this one dot char 2 char yeah and [Music] no it's not what i want convert dot sh [Music] oh i had to convert the um so temp dot string all right two two string two char array i'm sorry all right so now that we've converted everything back from upper to lower we converted back to our array and this may not actually even need to be done this way um because [Music] we're trying to do a single charge to a whole thing that may be a problem so i need to do a um let's do a char array that is actually so if i read this and then do temp plus equals now that resets every time so that's not going to work all right so i need a temp string outside of this yes so we'll do temp there do a temporary thing here set that to no value actually set that to an empty string to start with and then yes i said to string equals 10 plus equals temp and no actually i need to change that to a lower and then add it to the variable and then outside of that to attempt to back to guess and handle that so uh essentially this for loop will loop over every item in the array in the character or the guess array and from that change all of the values to lowercase equivalence and then turn around and put that into the char array i'm thinking that's probably the best route to do this may actually want to change this up though to be honest because it probably doesn't need to be a char array probably just needs to be just getting the first one so if we get the first um item out of here and put that in then we won't need to convert everything we just need to convert the zero index uh assuming that the zero index is well assuming that there's something that has been typed in because if there's nothing that's been typed in then that doesn't matter um so we can just do that instead of looping through the entire list of items so we'll do a string temp let's move this here and change adjust the indents um better yet i'm thinking well since we're only supposed to store the guess and that variable name guess um what i'm gonna do is leave that there so we'll call this a uh char i can't change a chart to a chart array so we'll change it to a string for the um wait guess and no so we'll call this input then we'll do input of zero is assigned to the string guess and then from here yes equals guess dot to lower and we can do away with that now that seems to be a little bit more simplified for what we're trying to do all right so now that we have the first character out of our string we actually probably want to check to make sure that the string is actually has a value here so i want to do input dot length is greater well yeah greater than zero then we want to do the stuff inside the if condition otherwise when you go to run this and the length is equal to zero then it will throw an exception for an index out of bounds and so obviously knowing that you don't want to code that in all right so that should do that particular part all right so the to do for number three is to check if the letter the user guest is one of the letters in the chosen word so to do that we'll do if um chosen word dot contains and guess yes okay and actually guest needs to come outside of this uh if statement so we'll do string guess equals to an empty string and so if that contains then console right line the letter you guess is contained in the word all right and obviously there's some more logic that needs to go in here um but i'm just putting these statements here for now so that we know what should go in each of these statements the letter and then i can do a uh the replacement string here is not contained in the word and then we'll do guess as that value then we'll come back up here guess and letter there we go is contained in the word got it all right so now that we have this existing logic well this logic in place what we want to do is to go ahead and build it and make sure that what we have is running thus far and also that it will build thus far but you will know though is that this will not repeat um once i put a letter in so if i type a letter um we'll do a capital p and for some reason i have issues with this working in visual studio code so let me open a terminal and run this application all right so i want to do dot net run from here and it should present the same information of asking for a letter to be entered i'm gonna do an uppercase p and it says the letter p is not contained in the word um we do not know which word that it picked so we probably want to add that piece of information to the output as well as the application uh that we're running because that's not also being output so we'll say welcome to hangman will be a capital h and we want to say [Music] all right so we have the chosen word so we can do console.writeline and say that the word has and we'll do a replacement there characters and with that we'll do chosen word dot length for the substitution value so now if we come back over to our terminal and run this again before enter a letter shows up on the screen it should say the word that we're looking for and so given that we only have three words it's pretty obvious which word that we're looking for and so the last time we typed p and we confirmed that p was not in the word uh whichever word it was but this time we actually know where it was which word it is because we can see the words and so we can type a letter in here uh we'll go ahead and type a and actually i'm going to type uppercase a just to make sure that the lowercase comparison is doing correctly and so the letter a is contained in the word and as you see it also dropped the lowercase or got the lowercase equivalent of that so that is working i did notice that the punctuation was missing so i'm going to add that in right now while i see it all right now we need this to continue to loop over instead of exiting like it's currently doing so what i'm gonna do is to include a while loop and i'm going to wrap that while loop around this to do and for starters i'm gonna just default it to true just so that the error messages go away but i'm actually going to fix that here shortly so that it um only actually is a legit while loop condition and so what we need to do is that we need to normally in hangman you have a number of tries so to do this number of tries you need to find a variable that does the number of tries or counts the number of tries we're going to call the int tries spelling this are uh yeah we call it entries and um or guess attempts would probably be more appropriate and we're going to initialize that to seven and then so while guess attempts is greater than zero because once you hit zero then you're out and we want to see that if the guess is not uh if the word is not correct then we want to remove the guess remove one of the guest attempts okay so since we also have the guest attempts we'll want to print the number of guesses remaining to the screen so we'll do console.writeline remaining attempts and we'll do the placement of the variable in there and semicolon and actually i'm go ahead and rename this to remaining attempts because it seems i'm trying to get away from using the same uh variable because we already have guess as a variable down here so when it comes to typing you'll try to make your variables fairly distinct that way if you have for example if you have string guess 2 well when you go to type somewhere down here guess it's going to auto auto excuse me it's going to uh use the intellisense and intellisense is going to throw whichever one it thinks you might be trying to type which in most scenarios for me uh doesn't necessarily make it to the correct one so i'm going to rename that for that reason all right now if we um come over here and run this and it will build all right so we have all the information welcome to hey man the word has six characters and enter a letter so we have let's say we're looking for t letter t is not contained in the word and as we also see the remaining attempt has dropped down by one to six and if we keep doing this and if you don't put anything in there the remaining attempts remains the same which is what we want um letter is not contained in the word and if we exit the loop we need to put a condition there that checks to see what happens after we exit the loop because there should be two conditions where you exit the loop if you run out of attempts or if you get the word correct so right now we're working on the attempts portion all right so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and we want to console.writeline you have ran out of attempts you lose and i know that's kind of a crude error uh it's a crude message but that's essentially what has happened all right that being said um the next part we can work on is actually doing the comparisons for if the guess is contained in the word so how do we do that um so we need to get the uh we need to also be able to display the word to which is a little bit complex um but i'm thinking we probably need to do the display in a separate function so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna build it out within this if condition and then take that statement once it's built out in if condition and move it over to a function where that would make sense and so i'm gonna go ahead and move this over to a function as well so we're going to extract a i believe it's extract method so that will take that to a separate method and [Music] pass that in and so if we come back up here and say exit game as the name of the function and we'll put all of the stuff that needs to be printed out to the screen inside of this exit game function and therefore you get a more concise uh loop and or main we'll continue that a little bit further and then um we could also leverage some class variables here too because we're using this function instead of passing these arguments in so what i'm going to do is actually make this remaining attempt into a [Music] if it'll let me do a cut it's not a constant um well one move it near the reference because it doesn't make sense that it's that far up uh all right now let's see if it'll let me do a not letting me do it so i'm just gonna have to force my way to do it we're going to declare a static variable with that in it all right and therefore if i have a static variable i do not need to pass the value in because the function the variable is because it's in the class it now knows what it is and so i don't have to do that um but that also means any function outside of domain can modify this value which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you're writing your code but it's fine in this case all right so now that we have our remaining temps configured correctly um the next step is to handle the correct guesses so we have it checking that if the letter is there then that is correct so we need to do a comparison of the we also need to track the letters that we already have guessed so let's do a um i want to declare another thing i want to declare another string array that says already guest letters and actually no that can't be an array so it have to be a list and the reason being that it would have to be a list is because that if it is an array that array will not uh hold the values in place so what i need to do is to do list of not word lists string and we'll call it already guest letters equals new list of string [Music] and we need to import a collection statement there for that which is [Music] system.collections.generic and let's see what else all right so we have that so we want to anytime we type a letter in we want to add that to the list of already guest letters so we're going to do already guess letters dot add and we want to add after we drop it to the lower case or convert it to lowercase then we want to add it to guess or add guess to it excuse me all right and let's see so that is correct um one other thing that i noticed that i probably want to go ahead and make it a little bit more difficult to make this a problem in the future is so the word list is already lower case but let's say somebody comes up in here and types a capital a in here instead well then we still wanted to remain lower case so i'm gonna do dot two lower on this uh setting of the word to chosen word that way that ensures that even if somebody does type a uppercase letter here that it is handled properly all right so we're adding our already guessed letters to the list and then we need to do a comparison of the already guessed letters versus the um not already guess letters what i'm thinking so um let me change this back for the sake of uh the way it should have been and already guessed letters so i want to i think we need to do a for loop on um you probably also need a variable up here that call uh that is a string that is called visible letters and we'll set that to that and then we want to set the divisible letters equal to wait 1 2 a 4 each var letter [Music] in uh actually no yeah before each in chosen word we want to set visible letters plus equals to star and that will be our masking of the letters um trying to think is that the correct that may or may not be the correct way to do it but this is one way that you can do this what i'm thinking is we may just need to cycle through each of the letters and if the letter has not already been guessed then that letter is replaced in the output before it is displayed to the screen and that way we know which letter um we don't have to keep track of the word in multiple well we may still need to do it in multiple variables won't be as difficult all right so let's see oh for each letter in chosen word uh or for each um yeah so for each letter um in already guessed honestly we want to start with the letters that are already visible and create a temporary string that will set so we'll do a um call a string display word set that the empty and then for each letter in chosen word we will do a comparison so if letter is equal to letter let's see no if trying to think already guess letters dot contains and then letter then and we'll make that a if statement i've already guessed letters contains letter uh with the letter passed in is that correct then we will add letter to the output so we'll call this uh or display so display word plus equals letter and if it does not else we'll do display word plus equals asterix and i think that's the proper way of doing that um what is wrong with this letter can i convert char to string got it so convert that to string with the parentheses that should handle that all right and so let's see what this does i want to remove this for the time being because i know i'm not going to need it and we'll come back over to our terminal window do clear and then do dot net run all right the variable visible letters is never used hmm okay that's fine i noticed i misspelled it too so uh we'll comment that out for the time being as well all right so our letter excuse me our word has eight letters uh we will have seven attempts enter a letter um so let's do an o all right so o is not included in the word six remaining attempts now i noticed something that the display is not printing out which it should be so that is a problem so let's move the display word um the display word needs to be reset every time it also needs to be visible where it could be fined [Music] so this way word contains guess as i'm looking at this i think i actually have the same condition in here or than i should because the same function is going to be called in either scenario [Music] and i need the display word to be kept in between cycles um so we'll do display word and i need another console right line because what i want to have happen is see how these are all crammed up right next to each other i don't want that to happen so what i'm gonna do is to after each attempt um so remaining attempts is six remaining attempts remaining attempts so i'm gonna add another console.writeline and just put a blank line there actually i don't even need quotes there just do it empty and that should do the same thing all right um now you could do all kinds of other kind of formatting like separating it with equals or not i'm keeping it simple so blank line will do in this particular case all right so now that we have guest letters and so chosen word contains yes then um and we may need to change this logic all together may rather need to do it this way instead of the other way um i'll leave it there for now all right so we need to reset this way word each time we come through and guess the right thing so what i'm gonna do is do display word it's equal to empty string um because if you keep appending to it then it won't be pretty after the second go around and at the end of the loop need to do console dot writeline and display work and that should be that all right so let's try this again clear the terminal run the application and let it build so now we have our space there so let's go ahead and type and oh all right so the letter o is not contained in the word got it so let's type in a it's still not printing my the actual word so that is a problem because it should be still displaying actual words so we may need to copy this here and put this there all right so let's exit and try that run again oops close ring let's run again let's put the letter o all right so now we're getting our word here so let's put the letter a and see what happens all right so we got the letter a and our attempts remained the same that's correct so we put the letter d we got our d what is it aardvark goes r we got our r and then we got a k and a v and we've spelled our word now only thing is a display word is the same as the actual contained word but we don't have a condition in our loop that would exit out that being said so we need to do if remaining attempts is greater than zero and if display word is not equal to uh nachos yeah chosen word i believe this is the correct way of doing this and then so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and then i want to put another statement here and have it say it could be an else statement here but i'm gonna do it this way if display and i don't have display word there so i probably will use an else statement here just to simplify this so if you're exiting the game that means you've done one or two things you've either gotten it wrong or you've gotten it right right line so you have won the game um and say you have yeah you have won the game that should be sufficient all right so coming back over here let's do a clear dot that run and hopefully this time uh get it right so our six letter word in our example is baboon so we can put a capital t in here for the sake of it and the letter t is not contained in the word now one thing we did not test but it should still work is if we put a number or a special character and i know you can't make letters and numbers out of special characters and there is a way to check that and make that possible but for the sake of this we are not going to add that logic we pretty much figure out if you put something in here that you shouldn't put in it's not going to work or it will be wrong so i put a pound sign in here and the letter pound granted that's not a letter um so we may need to change that output statement is not contained in a word so now that we have that there and i'm noticing something here is the original word has six asterisks here now this word has six plus six which is 12. so the condition to uh if your word is wrong is not doing something correct now i believe it's because it's not resetting the display word here so we needed to reset the display word regardless of where it's at so we need to move it up to here instead and i'm going to comment that out for the time being and then this here really needs to be a function because it is the same logic for both statements so i'm just going to go ahead and select that now do control dot and do extract method and so we're going to call this method um check this way i guess we call it um not check display let's see uh [Music] process display word all right and i know that's a mouthful but essentially that is what it's doing and so since this is the same as this down here it's going to go ahead and copy paste that there format and trim and then save so if we go back to our terminal and we'll try to run this again and make sure that that is correct all right so we have a five letter word a five-letter word in this example is camel so camel does not have an r in it so if we type r uh we get our five asterisks which we still should still have and then also have one less remaining attempt camel does have an m and we'll put it uppercase m in here for the sake of it it still should pass and it does and we still have six remaining c a let's do uh q for the sake of just because and e l camel so we have gotten the word and we have won the game um now if you want to you can take this a little bit further and actually do the drawing of the hangman part um i mentioned that earlier but i probably won't do that on this particular video because of the fact of drawing characters or ascii characters does take a little bit of effort um so let's walk back through the code one more time before we close out the video all right so we have our welcome to hangman opening here um we have our word list this word list can be longer just add more animals so dog you gotta do it in quotation marks dog elephants um ferrets uh efg so um giraffe there we go all right so we have one letter for the first one two three four five six seven letters of the alphabet that should be sufficient and then we did our two do one which is randomly choose a word from the list and assign it to a variable called chosen word so that's what we've done with these four lines here um we've had to add some additional variables here because of the fact we need to have those for our while loop and we also added the uh remaining attempts so that you know how many times you have remaining before you lose the game and then enter a letter so we need that information to prompt to the user for what for them to do something then you take that guess and process it accordingly get the first letter out of there if they put multiple characters in there it is possible you could handle that but for the sake of simplicity in this example we're only going to handle that with the by grabbing the first letter out of this string and do already guess letters with ad and um i actually come think of it i may actually have made a mistake i realize this condition may actually take [Music] um an error message i mean excuse me blank string and decrement the steps or decrement the remaining attempts but we'll have to test that again so already guess letters you add that to the guest the letters that have been guessed and then if the word is chosen contains the guess then that letter is contained in the word and we will process the display word so that is a number of arguments that are passed in and you loop over each letter in the chosen word and to see if that's there and so if if it is there you display that letter if not you show an asterisk in its place and then return this back to the caller um and then inside of that that would be it if you're doing this same set of stuff inside of the else condition you would decrement the remaining attempts and you would display the word uh regardless of you know asterisk letter combinations or just asterisks only once you get done with the while loop you will exit the game and that exit game comes down here and it determines whether you had zero remaining attempts and if you did have zero remaining attempts that means you ran out of attempts and you have lost the game um if you have remaining attempts that means you have won the game and one thing you probably want to also do here is do a console.right line and say the word was and then print out what the word was so um because usually if you lose you find out what the word is and so what we want to do is we'll probably have to set chosen word as so i set that one as a class variable i don't know if i want to do that well i'll go ahead and pass that in here as a class variable so um string um the word that's what i'll call this one here we'll wrong function all right so that there so therefore if you run out of attempts you do still find out what the word is and so now that we made that one adjustment let's do uh net run one final time so we have seven a seven character seven character word and seven remaining attempts so to enter a letter we're gonna do uh we'll put an h in there the letter h is not contained in the word um so most of the words if not mistaken all of the words well most of the words have the letter a so we can put a letter a in there all right so the letter a is in the word and i think i know what the word is based off what i've already entered letter g i r a f and there's two of those and we're gonna intentionally run out of letters even though we're so close and i kind of noticed something that well that's working correctly so if you put the same letter in twice uh as you see here i have a and i already had a in the previous go around it does not count off against your attempts because that letter already existed so that's something to keep in mind normally if you already guess a letter that's already been guessed then you have a output that says that letter has already been guessed and that logic can be added in here too as a if condition all right so continuing on let's finish out so that we run out of attempts and just gotta make sure i type letters all right so here we have it you have ran out of attempts you lose the word was giraffe and as you can kind of figure out that's kind of what it was based off the other guesses so that wraps that up for this video this video took a little bit longer than the previous coding sessions all the coding sessions won't necessarily be quick but um yeah this one hopefully you have learned a little bit um i know there are some video tutorials on hey this can be done in 10 minutes and more than likely those 10 minute videos are because of the fact they've already practiced it a number of times and they're just regurgitating that on video to have it done in a concise manner as you can see it took a decent amount of time and a lot of walking it through to get it to do what it needs to do so while you see those tutorials that may say i can do this in five minutes i can do it in 10 minutes actuality they probably practice it two or three times beforehand and then was able to go back and record it in the five to 10 minutes that you actually ended up seeing so any questions drop those in the comments this will probably not be the last of the coding challenges that i face and uh want to share with you so any questions comments comments uh the repository information will be provided so you can look at the source code for this until next time peace out","title":"Transcript

not synchronized with branches on the server or origin. Thus you have to manually clean up the branches that are on your local repo. Personally, I do this between sprints. Exception to this would be when I have a task that gets worked on in mulitple sprints. Reason I do this after each sprint is because when the task has been completed, it is merged into the development branch of code. No sense in keeping the code in two different places (or branches). Commands This is the command that I run via the command line to clean up all of the local branches. An explaination of the command is below. for b in $(git branch | grep -v -e dev -e master) do git branch -D ${b} done Command Breakdown for b in $(git branch | grep -v -e dev -e master) command is the start of the loop. It is in two parts. The first is the for loop and the second is filtering the output of the branches. git branch shows all of the branches that have been created in my local repository. grep -v -e dev -e master filters out the branches that have \"dev\" or \"master\" in their name. The only issue that I have with this command is that if you prefix your feature branches with \"dev\", then those branches will not be cleaned up. do and done are the beginning and ending of the for loop contents. These essentially would be the braces if you were writing a function for you C# and Java programmers. git branch -D ${b} is the command that will take each of the branches that is returned by the for loop and replace the variable with the branch name.

Links Mentioned Coding Challenge Repository Transcript (Unedited) what's going on good people this video i'm going to continue building out a coding challenge that i did with the password generator some time ago what i want to be able to do is to have this password generator be able to spit out multiple passwords at one time so basically you call the program with define some arguments and then it will give you know an output without you having to manually interact with the program the reason i want to do this is i want to be able to uh extend the functionality of the existing program but then also be able to do give it everything it needs in a single command and then it gives me everything back and then from there i could potentially use this in let's say a automation script to create users or use it in a script for like web driver for creating accounts or something of that nature and then also when it comes to the length of the password in the original coding challenge we had to specify the length of numbers letters and symbols this video i want you to try to get that so that if you don't provide or if you provide a argument it will just automatically come up with those numbers within a given range and then continue with the rest of the process that being said let's get started [Music] all right so this code will be available on github so if you want to have a copy of it by all means you can go to my github in the coding challenge repository this will be the password generator project and what i want to do so this code has not been changed it may have been modified a little bit i think i did add a function here to process the inputs and what i want to do is actually change that so that the if a value is not provided or if an argument is not provided for it to randomly figure out a number for each of these types then it prompts the user for the value that should be used so what i'm going to do i'm going to go ahead and copy um let's see want to copy these remaining lines here and not do that all right and let's go ahead and do format to rearrange that so i want to do a if um and i guess we can specify the arguments here and what i like to do is when i do my arguments i have a function that handles the arguments and based on those functions it based on what arguments are set it defines some variables in here so i'm going to create a pra private not practice private static [Music] um we'll call it void for now and then we'll call it process arguments and we'll do a string of args and this is literally being called after the password generator so we want to do process arguments and we are literally passing in what is being passed into the main so this goes into our process arguments function from this uh we'll probably set some class level variables because um well let me write this function out here because i probably don't actually even need a i'll probably put it into a function after i get done with everything but to initially write all of this out is not necessary so what i want to do is loop over every argument that is being provided so i'm going to do a for each bar argument in args and then for uh so what we want to do is if argument is equal to and we'll do a double dash um now you can do a single dash or double dash i'm using a linux computer and normally when you're providing if you're doing shorthand you do a single dash if you're doing the long hand version of an argument you do a double dash and to further demonstrate that example so let's do a grep and dash h which is shorthand and so it gives you that but as you see here even in this shorthand help it says try grep with the double dash help for more information and so if i do double dash help it gives you a whole lot more output so um that's kind of the way you could do it so i could do it with the shorthand i could do it with the longer hand or i could do both um another example of this since we are coding in net core so dot net core dash h gives you the help information here and as you see here it has two options so it has the dash h for the shorthand and then the double dash help for the long hand same thing for diagnosis you got the dash d and double dash diagnosis so like i say i'm gonna i'm gonna do it with the double dash i can probably go back and code it later with the single dash as an option as well so this argument we want to do uh we'll call it random length and i guess we can go ahead and do the single option as well so if argument random length or argument is equal to dash r we'll just call it that for short all right then we want to do um i have a random down here so what i'm gonna do is actually move this up in the code and i'm going to put it here and that way i can leverage it within my for each so we want to do want to copy [Music] let's see so i need these four items as well so what i'm gonna do is delete these and copy and move these up here and so i will so we'll initialize them to zero um let's see formats there we go all right so we'll initialize them to zero and then in here if we got random length what i would do is do number of letters is equal to random and we want to set the min range um i'm going to define this as int and the mid range we'll set it to 3 [Music] and then on the same line do max range and we'll set it to six all right so that being said with mem range and max range um what i'm going to do with those values is set the range for the random so the minimum number and i may need to change this up a little bit for well i'll take that back out so let's do this so we want our password to be a minimum number of letters but we also want to have a maximum number of letters numbers and symbols usually not just letters so what i want to do is do random.next and um ideally we can use symbols in there but we want to have a minimum length so to get uh ideally from my experience systems have a minimum length of 8 characters as a password and a maximum length of like 20 or something like that nature so i want to do a combination that would be on the low end eight and on the high end let's say we'll actually go with 16 because 20 seems while that would be a more secure password 20 is kind of pushing the limit of a lot of systems so to get uh so we'll do next for so we'll do a min value and um we'll do eight on this one plus letters so next we'll do symbols random dot next and we'll do two and uh four and then of numbers random dot next is two and four see this right so four and four is i can highlight it correctly so 4 and 4 is 8 and 8 to 8 is 16 so we have our max of let's do this again all right so here we have 4 four and four is eight and then you have eight onto that so it max length of 16 on the minimum you have two two which is four and another four which is eight so it will pick a password between 8 and 16 characters if we have the random length argument specified all right the next thing we want to do is to specify the number of passwords and so in order to do that because right now the way it's currently set it will only generate one password per run so what i want to do is to expand this and so we'll say if argument is equal to um let's see really let me change the code up a little bit so what i think i want to do now to make this a little bit easier i'm going to do a switch statement instead of if condition you can do this with the if condition but i think once you get to a certain number of if statements it becomes more efficient to use a switch statement instead of an if statement so that's what i'm going to go ahead and switch so i'm going to take the same functionality up here and just move it and put it within a case so we'll do random length and then we'll do a another case statement with uh dash r and then we will paste our numbers and so forth here and then we'll do a break and then as always you'll want to specify a default condition even if there is nothing to do with in no action to actually do in that default condition i would always make it a habit of specifying it so then the next case will be a um we'll call it dash in and above that i'm going to do case and put a little bit more space in here so we'll do uh num uh we'll do count we'll call it count and then we'll do this as dash c that way it makes a little bit more sense and so we will want to do the and i have a process input function [Music] um i don't want to well i want to be able to use this logic here uh to make sure that it is an integer um but i don't want it to prompt so what i may do is for the time being i'm gonna copy this out of here and paste it back and then when i get to a point of refactoring i'll probably uh modify the code accordingly so that it does uh a more valid uh it doesn't right have the same code written in it more than once all right so we're not writing an input and we are taking the arguments um for this i actually need the argument plus one so uh i'm gonna have to get rid of this for statement and do it i equals zero i less than args dot length i plus plus and for this you want to do [Music] args i and if when we come down here so we want to do args i plus one and so what the what this will do is so if the current argument is da double dash count or dash c then we want to get the integer value specified with the the integer value specified after these arguments so that's where you get the arguments which is the current argument plus one which would be that specified number and then we want to convert that into an integer and then we want this to be um we want this to be a variable so that needs to be [Music] password gen count i guess or uh pass yeah password you can count is equal to zero and then we'll set password gen counts or set the out the number specified to password you can count assuming that it does not throw an exception if it does throw an exception [Music] um you don't need a break statement there if it does throw an exception you want the program to exit [Music] so see uh not sure how to do that here um so what i'm gonna do i know i want the program to exit if they throw an invalid argument so what i'm gonna do is actually just take out the try block for the time being until i have a little bit of a moment to go back and research that all right so just to recap what we've done thus far so we have a for loop and we can get rid of that statement i have a for loop that will loop through all of the arguments that have been provided and from here we'll have the each of those values for if you provide the random length argument we'll do this here if you provide the count it will do this here and we need to do one more um option here and so that case will be if dash h and then we'll also do another one here where the case is help because we want to provide some help output and so i want to call a function print help and do a break and then here we'll do control dots and we'll create a method called print help and if we go to that definition so this will be a combination of or well it will consist of not a combination of console write lines that output the usage so for example how we have here this long output for the net that's h similar in nature for that so what i'm gonna do is actually kind of mimic this so we'll go with on this first line usage and then we'll say um password [Music] generator t or spelling is critical and then um arguments that's on that line then another console right line and you could do this console.writeline as one long string uh to make it easier to manage and come to think of it i probably will just do that so let's take this back so we'll do a string of help outputs and we'll do that and then um let's see so we have that one there do that one plus that's not right um wait a minute yeah that's okay so i am missing a um a new line i think is that correct let's see console. no okay i'm getting my technologies mixed up here all right so to do that so slash r slash n and that's a difficult thing to type so what i'm gonna do is because that character turned it's a difficult thing to type i'm going to type a new line and put that there and then so that new line and if i do a semicolon here that error should oh i'm missing that at the end that error should go away there we go all right so we have that and then plus new line intellisense helps makes things a little bit easier all right so the next thing in this part so they have a description of what the application is so i'm going to call it generate a password with the new line rocket type there we go all right and then we'll do another blank new line plus new line all right the next one is runtime option so we have to provide our arguments so we have a um what do we have we have the uh dash h or whoops need to put it in quotation marks so dash h or that double dash help and provides um help out well we'll say displays this screen um i've seen this done before i know it's kind of a rudimentary way of what the help is but essentially that is what the help is is for it shows you the current screen all right the next one will be the dash r and i think that's what we called it dash r yeah r with random length and c with count all right so random length display uh generates passwords uh put that in parentheses of random length and then the last one is dash c with a count um generates one two three uh specified number of passwords there we go all right so after we do all that then we do help output and remove that last one now we could do uh formatting of this these here so that they tab up um kind of like how this is tabbed up but that's a little bit more advanced so i'm not going to get into that with this particular video um but what you could do it's a cheap uh like not necessarily cheap way but a quicker way of doing it is you space out everything so that it lines up here and then when you run that it will line up correctly all right so let's give this program a go and um actually need to do net run with i believe i can pass the arguments here um no okay so i need to let's do dot net build and once it builds all right so do clear and then cd bin debug net core app 3.1 and then do dot slash password generator double dash help and there we go so we have the help information here um now what should not happen it should not prompt you for that information there so we're going to have to fix that particular part um so where are we so we are here with the help um what i'm going to do is to actually move the remaining parts of the current main uh the current code in main and we will move this highlight the code use control dot and call uh extract method and then we'll say um password let's see um generate password that's a very good not well i mean that is what it's doing but probably not the best usage of that um all right so we'll go with uh generate password all right there we go so with this if um does not need to return that value all right so we'll also need to update this here and what's this needs to do is now so if we're generating the password then um this function needs to be called here as well as no take that back um so if we do a break uh okay this is an interesting setup that i got myself into um all right so outside of the for loop if the so it needs to go outside of the for loop because we want to go make sure that we go through all of the arguments and um if we do go through all the arguments and let's see if we probably need to set another value here and if help is so we'll do a boolean and call do help and set it to false and if come down here and if we print the help then set do help equal to true [Music] and if we did the help so if do help is equal to false then we run the generate password if it's equal to true we want to skip over that all right and so that will i think this will address that issue um as for these if let's see so we need to have so the random numbers at the random numbers so if all the random numbers are equal to zero then yeah so the random number is equal to zero we want to skip over the processing of the input so i'm just going to add if um really you don't have to check all of them because if one is equal to zero is not equal uh no if it's equal to zero then we want to prompt for all of the values because by default these uh variables will be zero all right and then i did it right yes all right so oh so that's the output variable i'm not sure why it specified it to be a oh i know why because we're passing it in but it doesn't need to be an out variable so let's change this these outs to just be variables passed in because what is happening is the it because i use the extract method thing it assumed that these would be out variables and would be reused in the main function but in this particular scenario that's not true all right so we're only checking the number of letters so um because we're only checking the num of letters uh yeah that should be sufficient all right so let's go back so we're here and we want to if we're just performing the help test then we want to skip over that um i know some people are you're probably watching this and be like why is he having set that equal to false well you could also do this because i know some people prefer to do this with their code and it's essentially the same thing but my personal preference is when you're doing these type of statements um it's very easy in some programming languages this one net core not necessarily being one of them but it's very easy to see what i have highlighted here as a single variable instead of an exclamation point with a variable next to it so i try to refrain from doing that and i prefer to write my when i have these type of conditions i prefer to write it equal to false to make it clearly evident that you are looking for a false condition here instead of this uh exclamation with a variable name which is basically a not statement so if do help is not equal to true which is basically saying if do help is equal to false um so you know i try to avoid what is known as uh i think it's called like an inverse condition um that's one of the if i recall correctly is mentioned in rob robert martin's uh clean code book about using inverse conditional statements because the logic behind it is kind of confusing like you can see it and process it when you're actually trying to process your you know think your way through it uh it can be rather confusing to uh process and try to get correct so now that i've done with that spill all right so everything else should be working as it should so if you come back here and do uh i don't know if i can do net build from this directory and i can't all right so we'll go back to the password generator and do net build and i'm going to do is open a new tab in my ssh session and then we'll go to that build directory so dotnet bin all the way down dot slash password generator double slash help and there we go and then if i do a uh dash h it should give me the same output and it does so we know that the help screen is working the way it should be [Music] um yeah there we go all right so the next part is to [Music] we're going to double check your logic right quick and then try to run this and see what happens when we run it um so just to make sure so we have our number of letters all being set so we have here the number of letters is equal to zero but because we're giving it random values if the argument is passed this should never equal zero um it well all of these should never equal zero but in specific specifically we're checking the number of letters because that's the one that we're just only checking um you could write this if condition to check each one of these values to make sure that they're not equal to zero but because of what we have here if the number of letters is not equal to zero it is very unlikely unless something you know uh memory exception or something else occurs that these other two variables would be zero and even if then that something like a memory exception would occur it would throw that exception and probably wouldn't even execute these last two statements um when generating those random values so the rest of this code wouldn't even run all right that being said um the other thing we need to do is to have uh so let's set password drink out to one because not a think about it the you want this to run at least one time um and so if i do this here so a for statement and i want to ant equal zero while i mean excuse me not it um let's call this so we got password gen count uh there let's see we'll stick with i i don't think i have an i in this i do have an i in this so i can't use i well nope i'm sorry so this i is for that loop so i can do i here again um so if i equals zero i less than uh password gen counts and i plus plus and then we want to do the generate password and do format and also do trim real quick all right and so just to recap so when if a user passes in the argument of double dash count or dash c we wanted to convert this to a n32 and what i'm gonna do here is so i'm gonna re-enable this try catch and we'll say invalid input and what will happen here is we'll default the password gen count to one if an exception occurs and i'm gonna do the same thing here um could i have put this statement here in a finally block yes um am i going to do that no because then i'll have to have a condition that will check to see if the password jan is equal to one or greater than one and that's a little bit extra code so it's easier just to drop it and set this value here that if you have an exception of if you throw an exception then just default it to one and that ensures that even if the value that you're typing in for the count is mistyped or uh if if it's not an integer or if it is a it's not entered like if you type the argument but don't type the secondary argument with it that it is caught um and i guess the other thing with this is to also catch i guess a general exception with this particular value because i'm not um i think it's argument null uh or argument exception i'm not sure which one it is so we're gonna go to an argument exception for this and when we test it if it doesn't work the way you would think it would work then [Music] we'll just handle it accordingly and still set it to one that way it will be it won't cause any other issues um and we'll say error occurred because most users don't understand exceptions but they do understand error um so i'm gonna type that there error and then do uh open brace zero close brace with ex dot message as the value to replace the zero placeholder here and we're still going to set that to the password account to one that way we still get a password even if we throw an exception um all right this looks like it is ready to go uh the rest of the logic for actually generating the password is not changed um we just added other things around it to process or you know address what needs to be done and that being said let's go back to the console and we'll do another net build on this console tab all right bill succeeded so let's clear the screen and i'm going to do dot slash password generator and this time i'm going to pass in uh let's see we're going to do a dash r and so it should just give me there we go so it works so we have it generating a random password and i can do this as many times as i want as you see here the length of the password is changing uh each time this these two times they got the same length which is still acceptable um this one is a little bit longer if you kind of draw a line straight down you'll see that it doesn't quite hit and this one is clearly shorter uh i think this one is actually this one is the minimum length of eight characters as you see one two three four and then five six seven eight all right so the next thing is to try out the count and so we'll do dash r c and we'll give it a count of five so this time we should get five passwords there we go and so we have our five passwords and they're all the same length um and i think that has to do with the random generator uh because the random function when you initialize it it i if i'm not mistaken it uses the current time to get a random value um so that is probably playing a part in the length of the password um well i'll take that back no because we're actually setting so we're setting the random link in the beginning and because it's set in a random length in the beginning that means when it does that count then it's going to do that each time okay so what may needs what may uh let's see so let's change some of the logic here so that we get a different password length each time that we do multiple passwords uh so what i want to do is actually to move this um so we're going to move this to a method uh control dots extract method and we'll do we'll leave that there and we'll rename this new method to get random links l-e-n-g-t-h-s there we go all right and so if we go to the definition of that it will set the it will get the random lengths and then return those back to their respective values but that function does not need to go here it needs to actually go down here in our four and so we want to do if random lengths is equal not the function call come on l-e-n-g-t-h-s is equal to well we'll just leave it there so it is understood that if that is true then we want to do this function call and set that here and then we need to define this as a [Music] need um generate a variable and we'll call it a not a property it's not a parameter or is it a no it's not a parameter so it's a it's not a field either okay um not seeing what i wanted to see so we'll do bool random lengths is equal to false and then here we will set random lengths is equal to true and not double equals that's comparison operator all right that should work there and then so when we come down here if get random lengths is yeah so this is true then it will get the random lanes and then we will get random values for our passwords each time so let's go ahead and do a build and if we come back over to our console and do a run with five passwords all right and so now we're getting five passwords with different links as you see here yeah so we're getting five passwords with different links and that's what you should get out of a random ising function [Music] let's see are there any other scenarios that we want to test so we're getting five so let's see what happens if we do the r without let me excuse me do the c without the r all right and so um because we're not doing random passwords but we are doing the count it will prompt five times all right so it gave that password and so it's going to ask again five times how many uh letters do you want in your password and then we'll just keep going all right and so it asked us five times how many letters would we like in our password this does work but i do not see a use case for just this dash c5 option but i'm going to leave it in there just in case um you know i may have a use case for it i don't foresee a use case for it but it is useful to have it now that we've done that let's go back and demonstrate the full values excuse me the full length name of the arguments so we're going to do the same function with the double dash random length as being passed in as an argument and there we go so we can confirm that that works and then if we do just dash r we can also see that that works and then if we do the same thing before with a with the count fully specified you'll see here we get our five passwords with the arguments the full length excuse me the full name of the arguments being specified here too so i believe this works the way that it uh is intended um it's still saying your password is for each of these what could be done is if you are specifying the if an argument count is greater than zero you could possibly trim this out that way you know uh is being you want the program to run in kind of a headless type mode [Music] but i'm not going to do that right now that may be a future enhancement to this uh coding challenge and so you're probably asking well what happens if you don't pass any arguments so let's go ahead and try that option as well and as you see it works as it did in the original coding challenge where it asks you how many of each that you want and then it spits out a password in the end so that will wrap things up for this particular video uh this uh i'll continue to add on to these existing coding challenges that i've done so that you know how to add additional features to your particular application that you're building if this video has

Challenge Repository","title":"Links Mentioned"},{"location":"technology/2021.05.04-coding-challenge-generate-random-passwords/#transcript-unedited","text":"what's going on good people this video i'm going to continue building out a coding challenge that i did with the password generator some time ago what i want to be able to do is to have this password generator be able to spit out multiple passwords at one time so basically you call the program with define some arguments and then it will give you know an output without you having to manually interact with the program the reason i want to do this is i want to be able to uh extend the functionality of the existing program but then also be able to do give it everything it needs in a single command and then it gives me everything back and then from there i could potentially use this in let's say a automation script to create users or use it in a script for like web driver for creating accounts or something of that nature and then also when it comes to the length of the password in the original coding challenge we had to specify the length of numbers letters and symbols this video i want you to try to get that so that if you don't provide or if you provide a argument it will just automatically come up with those numbers within a given range and then continue with the rest of the process that being said let's get started [Music] all right so this code will be available on github so if you want to have a copy of it by all means you can go to my github in the coding challenge repository this will be the password generator project and what i want to do so this code has not been changed it may have been modified a little bit i think i did add a function here to process the inputs and what i want to do is actually change that so that the if a value is not provided or if an argument is not provided for it to randomly figure out a number for each of these types then it prompts the user for the value that should be used so what i'm going to do i'm going to go ahead and copy um let's see want to copy these remaining lines here and not do that all right and let's go ahead and do format to rearrange that so i want to do a if um and i guess we can specify the arguments here and what i like to do is when i do my arguments i have a function that handles the arguments and based on those functions it based on what arguments are set it defines some variables in here so i'm going to create a pra private not practice private static [Music] um we'll call it void for now and then we'll call it process arguments and we'll do a string of args and this is literally being called after the password generator so we want to do process arguments and we are literally passing in what is being passed into the main so this goes into our process arguments function from this uh we'll probably set some class level variables because um well let me write this function out here because i probably don't actually even need a i'll probably put it into a function after i get done with everything but to initially write all of this out is not necessary so what i want to do is loop over every argument that is being provided so i'm going to do a for each bar argument in args and then for uh so what we want to do is if argument is equal to and we'll do a double dash um now you can do a single dash or double dash i'm using a linux computer and normally when you're providing if you're doing shorthand you do a single dash if you're doing the long hand version of an argument you do a double dash and to further demonstrate that example so let's do a grep and dash h which is shorthand and so it gives you that but as you see here even in this shorthand help it says try grep with the double dash help for more information and so if i do double dash help it gives you a whole lot more output so um that's kind of the way you could do it so i could do it with the shorthand i could do it with the longer hand or i could do both um another example of this since we are coding in net core so dot net core dash h gives you the help information here and as you see here it has two options so it has the dash h for the shorthand and then the double dash help for the long hand same thing for diagnosis you got the dash d and double dash diagnosis so like i say i'm gonna i'm gonna do it with the double dash i can probably go back and code it later with the single dash as an option as well so this argument we want to do uh we'll call it random length and i guess we can go ahead and do the single option as well so if argument random length or argument is equal to dash r we'll just call it that for short all right then we want to do um i have a random down here so what i'm gonna do is actually move this up in the code and i'm going to put it here and that way i can leverage it within my for each so we want to do want to copy [Music] let's see so i need these four items as well so what i'm gonna do is delete these and copy and move these up here and so i will so we'll initialize them to zero um let's see formats there we go all right so we'll initialize them to zero and then in here if we got random length what i would do is do number of letters is equal to random and we want to set the min range um i'm going to define this as int and the mid range we'll set it to 3 [Music] and then on the same line do max range and we'll set it to six all right so that being said with mem range and max range um what i'm going to do with those values is set the range for the random so the minimum number and i may need to change this up a little bit for well i'll take that back out so let's do this so we want our password to be a minimum number of letters but we also want to have a maximum number of letters numbers and symbols usually not just letters so what i want to do is do random.next and um ideally we can use symbols in there but we want to have a minimum length so to get uh ideally from my experience systems have a minimum length of 8 characters as a password and a maximum length of like 20 or something like that nature so i want to do a combination that would be on the low end eight and on the high end let's say we'll actually go with 16 because 20 seems while that would be a more secure password 20 is kind of pushing the limit of a lot of systems so to get uh so we'll do next for so we'll do a min value and um we'll do eight on this one plus letters so next we'll do symbols random dot next and we'll do two and uh four and then of numbers random dot next is two and four see this right so four and four is i can highlight it correctly so 4 and 4 is 8 and 8 to 8 is 16 so we have our max of let's do this again all right so here we have 4 four and four is eight and then you have eight onto that so it max length of 16 on the minimum you have two two which is four and another four which is eight so it will pick a password between 8 and 16 characters if we have the random length argument specified all right the next thing we want to do is to specify the number of passwords and so in order to do that because right now the way it's currently set it will only generate one password per run so what i want to do is to expand this and so we'll say if argument is equal to um let's see really let me change the code up a little bit so what i think i want to do now to make this a little bit easier i'm going to do a switch statement instead of if condition you can do this with the if condition but i think once you get to a certain number of if statements it becomes more efficient to use a switch statement instead of an if statement so that's what i'm going to go ahead and switch so i'm going to take the same functionality up here and just move it and put it within a case so we'll do random length and then we'll do a another case statement with uh dash r and then we will paste our numbers and so forth here and then we'll do a break and then as always you'll want to specify a default condition even if there is nothing to do with in no action to actually do in that default condition i would always make it a habit of specifying it so then the next case will be a um we'll call it dash in and above that i'm going to do case and put a little bit more space in here so we'll do uh num uh we'll do count we'll call it count and then we'll do this as dash c that way it makes a little bit more sense and so we will want to do the and i have a process input function [Music] um i don't want to well i want to be able to use this logic here uh to make sure that it is an integer um but i don't want it to prompt so what i may do is for the time being i'm gonna copy this out of here and paste it back and then when i get to a point of refactoring i'll probably uh modify the code accordingly so that it does uh a more valid uh it doesn't right have the same code written in it more than once all right so we're not writing an input and we are taking the arguments um for this i actually need the argument plus one so uh i'm gonna have to get rid of this for statement and do it i equals zero i less than args dot length i plus plus and for this you want to do [Music] args i and if when we come down here so we want to do args i plus one and so what the what this will do is so if the current argument is da double dash count or dash c then we want to get the integer value specified with the the integer value specified after these arguments so that's where you get the arguments which is the current argument plus one which would be that specified number and then we want to convert that into an integer and then we want this to be um we want this to be a variable so that needs to be [Music] password gen count i guess or uh pass yeah password you can count is equal to zero and then we'll set password gen counts or set the out the number specified to password you can count assuming that it does not throw an exception if it does throw an exception [Music] um you don't need a break statement there if it does throw an exception you want the program to exit [Music] so see uh not sure how to do that here um so what i'm gonna do i know i want the program to exit if they throw an invalid argument so what i'm gonna do is actually just take out the try block for the time being until i have a little bit of a moment to go back and research that all right so just to recap what we've done thus far so we have a for loop and we can get rid of that statement i have a for loop that will loop through all of the arguments that have been provided and from here we'll have the each of those values for if you provide the random length argument we'll do this here if you provide the count it will do this here and we need to do one more um option here and so that case will be if dash h and then we'll also do another one here where the case is help because we want to provide some help output and so i want to call a function print help and do a break and then here we'll do control dots and we'll create a method called print help and if we go to that definition so this will be a combination of or well it will consist of not a combination of console write lines that output the usage so for example how we have here this long output for the net that's h similar in nature for that so what i'm gonna do is actually kind of mimic this so we'll go with on this first line usage and then we'll say um password [Music] generator t or spelling is critical and then um arguments that's on that line then another console right line and you could do this console.writeline as one long string uh to make it easier to manage and come to think of it i probably will just do that so let's take this back so we'll do a string of help outputs and we'll do that and then um let's see so we have that one there do that one plus that's not right um wait a minute yeah that's okay so i am missing a um a new line i think is that correct let's see console. no okay i'm getting my technologies mixed up here all right so to do that so slash r slash n and that's a difficult thing to type so what i'm gonna do is because that character turned it's a difficult thing to type i'm going to type a new line and put that there and then so that new line and if i do a semicolon here that error should oh i'm missing that at the end that error should go away there we go all right so we have that and then plus new line intellisense helps makes things a little bit easier all right so the next thing in this part so they have a description of what the application is so i'm going to call it generate a password with the new line rocket type there we go all right and then we'll do another blank new line plus new line all right the next one is runtime option so we have to provide our arguments so we have a um what do we have we have the uh dash h or whoops need to put it in quotation marks so dash h or that double dash help and provides um help out well we'll say displays this screen um i've seen this done before i know it's kind of a rudimentary way of what the help is but essentially that is what the help is is for it shows you the current screen all right the next one will be the dash r and i think that's what we called it dash r yeah r with random length and c with count all right so random length display uh generates passwords uh put that in parentheses of random length and then the last one is dash c with a count um generates one two three uh specified number of passwords there we go all right so after we do all that then we do help output and remove that last one now we could do uh formatting of this these here so that they tab up um kind of like how this is tabbed up but that's a little bit more advanced so i'm not going to get into that with this particular video um but what you could do it's a cheap uh like not necessarily cheap way but a quicker way of doing it is you space out everything so that it lines up here and then when you run that it will line up correctly all right so let's give this program a go and um actually need to do net run with i believe i can pass the arguments here um no okay so i need to let's do dot net build and once it builds all right so do clear and then cd bin debug net core app 3.1 and then do dot slash password generator double dash help and there we go so we have the help information here um now what should not happen it should not prompt you for that information there so we're going to have to fix that particular part um so where are we so we are here with the help um what i'm going to do is to actually move the remaining parts of the current main uh the current code in main and we will move this highlight the code use control dot and call uh extract method and then we'll say um password let's see um generate password that's a very good not well i mean that is what it's doing but probably not the best usage of that um all right so we'll go with uh generate password all right there we go so with this if um does not need to return that value all right so we'll also need to update this here and what's this needs to do is now so if we're generating the password then um this function needs to be called here as well as no take that back um so if we do a break uh okay this is an interesting setup that i got myself into um all right so outside of the for loop if the so it needs to go outside of the for loop because we want to go make sure that we go through all of the arguments and um if we do go through all the arguments and let's see if we probably need to set another value here and if help is so we'll do a boolean and call do help and set it to false and if come down here and if we print the help then set do help equal to true [Music] and if we did the help so if do help is equal to false then we run the generate password if it's equal to true we want to skip over that all right and so that will i think this will address that issue um as for these if let's see so we need to have so the random numbers at the random numbers so if all the random numbers are equal to zero then yeah so the random number is equal to zero we want to skip over the processing of the input so i'm just going to add if um really you don't have to check all of them because if one is equal to zero is not equal uh no if it's equal to zero then we want to prompt for all of the values because by default these uh variables will be zero all right and then i did it right yes all right so oh so that's the output variable i'm not sure why it specified it to be a oh i know why because we're passing it in but it doesn't need to be an out variable so let's change this these outs to just be variables passed in because what is happening is the it because i use the extract method thing it assumed that these would be out variables and would be reused in the main function but in this particular scenario that's not true all right so we're only checking the number of letters so um because we're only checking the num of letters uh yeah that should be sufficient all right so let's go back so we're here and we want to if we're just performing the help test then we want to skip over that um i know some people are you're probably watching this and be like why is he having set that equal to false well you could also do this because i know some people prefer to do this with their code and it's essentially the same thing but my personal preference is when you're doing these type of statements um it's very easy in some programming languages this one net core not necessarily being one of them but it's very easy to see what i have highlighted here as a single variable instead of an exclamation point with a variable next to it so i try to refrain from doing that and i prefer to write my when i have these type of conditions i prefer to write it equal to false to make it clearly evident that you are looking for a false condition here instead of this uh exclamation with a variable name which is basically a not statement so if do help is not equal to true which is basically saying if do help is equal to false um so you know i try to avoid what is known as uh i think it's called like an inverse condition um that's one of the if i recall correctly is mentioned in rob robert martin's uh clean code book about using inverse conditional statements because the logic behind it is kind of confusing like you can see it and process it when you're actually trying to process your you know think your way through it uh it can be rather confusing to uh process and try to get correct so now that i've done with that spill all right so everything else should be working as it should so if you come back here and do uh i don't know if i can do net build from this directory and i can't all right so we'll go back to the password generator and do net build and i'm going to do is open a new tab in my ssh session and then we'll go to that build directory so dotnet bin all the way down dot slash password generator double slash help and there we go and then if i do a uh dash h it should give me the same output and it does so we know that the help screen is working the way it should be [Music] um yeah there we go all right so the next part is to [Music] we're going to double check your logic right quick and then try to run this and see what happens when we run it um so just to make sure so we have our number of letters all being set so we have here the number of letters is equal to zero but because we're giving it random values if the argument is passed this should never equal zero um it well all of these should never equal zero but in specific specifically we're checking the number of letters because that's the one that we're just only checking um you could write this if condition to check each one of these values to make sure that they're not equal to zero but because of what we have here if the number of letters is not equal to zero it is very unlikely unless something you know uh memory exception or something else occurs that these other two variables would be zero and even if then that something like a memory exception would occur it would throw that exception and probably wouldn't even execute these last two statements um when generating those random values so the rest of this code wouldn't even run all right that being said um the other thing we need to do is to have uh so let's set password drink out to one because not a think about it the you want this to run at least one time um and so if i do this here so a for statement and i want to ant equal zero while i mean excuse me not it um let's call this so we got password gen count uh there let's see we'll stick with i i don't think i have an i in this i do have an i in this so i can't use i well nope i'm sorry so this i is for that loop so i can do i here again um so if i equals zero i less than uh password gen counts and i plus plus and then we want to do the generate password and do format and also do trim real quick all right and so just to recap so when if a user passes in the argument of double dash count or dash c we wanted to convert this to a n32 and what i'm gonna do here is so i'm gonna re-enable this try catch and we'll say invalid input and what will happen here is we'll default the password gen count to one if an exception occurs and i'm gonna do the same thing here um could i have put this statement here in a finally block yes um am i going to do that no because then i'll have to have a condition that will check to see if the password jan is equal to one or greater than one and that's a little bit extra code so it's easier just to drop it and set this value here that if you have an exception of if you throw an exception then just default it to one and that ensures that even if the value that you're typing in for the count is mistyped or uh if if it's not an integer or if it is a it's not entered like if you type the argument but don't type the secondary argument with it that it is caught um and i guess the other thing with this is to also catch i guess a general exception with this particular value because i'm not um i think it's argument null uh or argument exception i'm not sure which one it is so we're gonna go to an argument exception for this and when we test it if it doesn't work the way you would think it would work then [Music] we'll just handle it accordingly and still set it to one that way it will be it won't cause any other issues um and we'll say error occurred because most users don't understand exceptions but they do understand error um so i'm gonna type that there error and then do uh open brace zero close brace with ex dot message as the value to replace the zero placeholder here and we're still going to set that to the password account to one that way we still get a password even if we throw an exception um all right this looks like it is ready to go uh the rest of the logic for actually generating the password is not changed um we just added other things around it to process or you know address what needs to be done and that being said let's go back to the console and we'll do another net build on this console tab all right bill succeeded so let's clear the screen and i'm going to do dot slash password generator and this time i'm going to pass in uh let's see we're going to do a dash r and so it should just give me there we go so it works so we have it generating a random password and i can do this as many times as i want as you see here the length of the password is changing uh each time this these two times they got the same length which is still acceptable um this one is a little bit longer if you kind of draw a line straight down you'll see that it doesn't quite hit and this one is clearly shorter uh i think this one is actually this one is the minimum length of eight characters as you see one two three four and then five six seven eight all right so the next thing is to try out the count and so we'll do dash r c and we'll give it a count of five so this time we should get five passwords there we go and so we have our five passwords and they're all the same length um and i think that has to do with the random generator uh because the random function when you initialize it it i if i'm not mistaken it uses the current time to get a random value um so that is probably playing a part in the length of the password um well i'll take that back no because we're actually setting so we're setting the random link in the beginning and because it's set in a random length in the beginning that means when it does that count then it's going to do that each time okay so what may needs what may uh let's see so let's change some of the logic here so that we get a different password length each time that we do multiple passwords uh so what i want to do is actually to move this um so we're going to move this to a method uh control dots extract method and we'll do we'll leave that there and we'll rename this new method to get random links l-e-n-g-t-h-s there we go all right and so if we go to the definition of that it will set the it will get the random lengths and then return those back to their respective values but that function does not need to go here it needs to actually go down here in our four and so we want to do if random lengths is equal not the function call come on l-e-n-g-t-h-s is equal to well we'll just leave it there so it is understood that if that is true then we want to do this function call and set that here and then we need to define this as a [Music] need um generate a variable and we'll call it a not a property it's not a parameter or is it a no it's not a parameter so it's a it's not a field either okay um not seeing what i wanted to see so we'll do bool random lengths is equal to false and then here we will set random lengths is equal to true and not double equals that's comparison operator all right that should work there and then so when we come down here if get random lengths is yeah so this is true then it will get the random lanes and then we will get random values for our passwords each time so let's go ahead and do a build and if we come back over to our console and do a run with five passwords all right and so now we're getting five passwords with different links as you see here yeah so we're getting five passwords with different links and that's what you should get out of a random ising function [Music] let's see are there any other scenarios that we want to test so we're getting five so let's see what happens if we do the r without let me excuse me do the c without the r all right and so um because we're not doing random passwords but we are doing the count it will prompt five times all right so it gave that password and so it's going to ask again five times how many uh letters do you want in your password and then we'll just keep going all right and so it asked us five times how many letters would we like in our password this does work but i do not see a use case for just this dash c5 option but i'm going to leave it in there just in case um you know i may have a use case for it i don't foresee a use case for it but it is useful to have it now that we've done that let's go back and demonstrate the full values excuse me the full length name of the arguments so we're going to do the same function with the double dash random length as being passed in as an argument and there we go so we can confirm that that works and then if we do just dash r we can also see that that works and then if we do the same thing before with a with the count fully specified you'll see here we get our five passwords with the arguments the full length excuse me the full name of the arguments being specified here too so i believe this works the way that it uh is intended um it's still saying your password is for each of these what could be done is if you are specifying the if an argument count is greater than zero you could possibly trim this out that way you know uh is being you want the program to run in kind of a headless type mode [Music] but i'm not going to do that right now that may be a future enhancement to this uh coding challenge and so you're probably asking well what happens if you don't pass any arguments so let's go ahead and try that option as well and as you see it works as it did in the original coding challenge where it asks you how many of each that you want and then it spits out a password in the end so that will wrap things up for this particular video uh this uh i'll continue to add on to these existing coding challenges that i've done so that you know how to add additional features to your particular application that you're building if this video has been helpful or if you have any questions about anything that you've seen in this video please give me a thumbs up if you like it and then drop your question down below afterwards or your comment down below afterwards as well uh if this is your first time to the channel please be sure to consider subscribing each week a new tech video comes out on

(Unedited)"},{"location":"technology/2021.05.06-tech-job-with-no-experience/","text":"Background In a Facebook group that I am a member of, someone asked the following: Web Developer's How are you all preparing for interviews? I have no actual web development work experience. But I do have certifications CIW Web Design Specialist and CIW JavaScript Specialist. I landed an interview that pays up to XXk (omitted number on purpose). How would you prepare? I also have a BSIT Bachelor's and a AAS in Computing and Information Technology. Also course work in Python and Raptor. For clarity, the AAS is an Associate's Degree. Now this is similar to questions that I have seen and had others ask before. What I have found is that people that are new to the technology field are told that they need to have degrees and years of experience. While it may be true for some fields, it is not required for all parts of the technology field. How would one go about getting a job in the field without experience? In my opinion, the keys to success would be using LinkedIn, have a portfolio of work, and practice regularly. LinkedIn I had a conversation with a resume coach and even seen the comments that she has left on other posts about how to use LinkedIn properly. She is advocate for being active on LinkedIn to get users to draw to you. By being an active user and your name showing up on posts of people who are 2nd and 3rd+ connections, your name becomes more visible to an audience that is beyond your circle. How do you do this? Post What You Do True story. I share my personal projects on LinkedIn . I usually do not share my work projects on LinkedIn because in the past, that code and other aspects of the work were considered private and company property (read those work NDA and contracts in their entirety). However, I may talk about those projects at a high level, but not share the source code like I do with my personal projects. I work in the technology industry as a programmer. To reinforce that, I share my personal technology related projects on my LinkedIn. That provides validation that I am who I say that I am by showing it through the work that I do. Now it does not happen often, but when I posted about the internet connection monitor it got some attention and I received several connection requests from others who are interested in the same subject matter and technologies that I used. Also be sure to include relevant hashtags in your posts. LinkedIn allows its users to follow hashtags. By using hashtags in your posts, those who want to see posts related to a certain topic will see your post vs not using hashtags. Comments, Not Just Likes Another thing that you will need to do is to comment on the posts that you see. Now you cannot just throw any random ole comment out there. Make comments that are actually relevant to the post. For example, there was this post: In this post, the person in the wheelchair had to try multiple times to get to the top of the ramp before actually being able to do so. As you see, my comment was about understanding what the video was about, but also making a point that the ramp was probably far from being compliant with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) rules. Online Portfolio The personal projects that I have, I post the source code on GitHub. I do have some non-code projects on GitHub, but those are there to serve as a backup source in case the unexpected happens. As an IT professional, you need a portfolio or repository of the work that you have done. It does not have to be a repository of code. For example, I know a former college classmate who works in project management. She has a folder of her previous work to serve as her portfolio. She also uses this portfolio to keep track of her CEU (Continuing Education Credits) for her PMO certification. Another example of this would be the DFIR Diva . I will be honest, I have zero interest in digital forensics, but I was amazed at the set up that she had and how she chose to document it on Twitter about how she became great at digital forensics. The photos that I saw of her home lab had me thinking: Her power bill must be through the roof. She got a lot of equipment. She definitely has taken time to practice to be good at what she does. She has a library of books on that shelf. She's probably been doing a lot of research and studying. GitHub I use GitHub as my online portfolio for my source code. I will admit that I do have some non-source code repositories, such as my Xlights repository that serves as a backup for my Christmas light show files. As a programmer and listing GitHub in my LinkedIn posts, people that are interested in the work that I do, can see and try my code for themselves. By using GitHub in the traditional (source code) and non-traditional (text file or configuration backup) manner, supports that I have the knowledge to adapt an existing technology to better suit my and multiple needs. Practice, Practice, Practice There's a number of sayings about practice. Practice makes perfect. Preparation prevents piss poor performance How do you prepare for something? You practice. Football players practice by doing drills and two-a-days. Firefighters practice by doing trainings at their practice facilities and competing in competitions. What makes you so good that you cannot practice? Especially if you are trying to get paid for the work that you do. Find Homework Assignments When I tell people that they need to practice and come up with scenarios that they think they may encounter on the job, they say that they cannot because they have never done this or been in this type of environment before. My response to that is to go find some homework assignments online and attempt to work those in the language of their choosing. A lot of the time, people who get stuck doing their coding homework, will post code snippets or the assignment problem online. Those that respond to the post, will either share how they did it or provide some code to help the individual get through the part that s/he is stuck on. Coding Challenges I am part of Black Cloud Geeks group on Facebook. Part of the reason that I am involved in the group is because I know the group organizer, but also because this group is all tech driven and works towards learning from each other. For a while, coding challenges were being posted in the group. The reason that those challenges were being posted in the group was so that those learning Python would have a reason to gain some practice. After all, those challenges were targeted for Python programmers. I took it upon myself to participate in these challenges, but instead of doing them in Python, I did them in C#. Why would I do a challenge in a language other than what was asked? I should be doing the challenge in the language asked so that I can expand my skillset right? Not necessarily. In 2019, I had an interview. The interviewer said that he knew that I could code based on me solving the coding problem that I had did in the interview and my skills listed in my resume. However , he offered me some career advice and said that because my skills were in a number of languages and technologies, that I should narrow it down and be more of a specialist instead of knowing a lot of languages. In other words... Jack of all trades, master of none. You have probably heard the quote above before. So since I currently work with (at the writing of this article) C# and .NET Core at work, I decided to do these coding challenges in C# with .NET Core. This would allow me to advance my knowledge in the programming language that I regularly work with and also give me different exposure to the language as these challenges did not involve creating web-based applications like I normally do at work. To further reinforce this point, I refactored several of the applications that I had previously written in Java to C#. In doing those refactorings, I now better understand the purpose of NuGet packages, that namespace in C# and package in Java are basically the same, and the similarities between the betweet the languages, just to name a few. To view the coding challenges that I have done, check out my coding challenge repository . While you are there, I would encourage you to attempt the challenges in a different language of your choosing in order to improve your skills and knowledge. Conclusion For the best chance at landing a interview or job opportunity, consider doing a combination of all of these things. Reason being is that they will demonstrate to others that you know what you are talking about, that you can back up the talk (i.e. walk the walk, talk the talk), and help you provide proof that you know how to do the work. If you want to take this to the next level, you can document your experiences via a blog or on video of doing coding sessions or other projects that you have. If you have topics or questions that you would like for me to answer, you can reach me on Twitter or Instagram .","title":"Get A Tech Job with No Experience"},{"location":"technology/2021.05.06-tech-job-with-no-experience/#background","text":"In a Facebook group that I am a member of, someone asked the following: Web Developer's How are you all preparing for interviews? I have no actual web development work experience. But I do have certifications CIW Web Design Specialist and CIW JavaScript Specialist. I landed an interview that pays up to XXk (omitted number on purpose). How would you prepare? I also have a BSIT Bachelor's and a AAS in Computing and Information Technology. Also course work in Python and Raptor. For clarity, the AAS is an Associate's Degree. Now this is similar to questions that I have seen and had others ask before. What I have found is that people that are new to the technology field are told that they need to have degrees and years of experience. While it may be true for some fields, it is not required for all parts of the technology field. How would one go about getting a job in the field without experience? In my opinion, the keys to success would be using LinkedIn, have a portfolio of work, and practice regularly.","title":"Background"},{"location":"technology/2021.05.06-tech-job-with-no-experience/#linkedin","text":"I had a conversation with a resume coach and even seen the comments that she has left on other posts about how to use LinkedIn properly.

However, I may talk about those projects at a high level, but not share the source code like I do with my personal projects. I work in the technology industry as a programmer. To reinforce that, I share my personal technology related projects on my LinkedIn. That provides validation that I am who I say that I am by showing it through the work that I do. Now it does not happen often, but when I posted about the internet connection monitor it got some attention and I received several connection requests from others who are interested in the same subject matter and technologies that I used.

Solution Update Remotes To fix this problem, you will need to update your remotes to point to the SSH path of the repository instead of using the HTTPS path of the repository. Before I made the update, the remote to my repository source was almostengineer@aeoffice:~/trafficpi$ git remote -v origin https://github.com/almostengr/trafficpi.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/almostengr/trafficpi.git (push) Then I ran the command to update the repository source. To get the SSH remote path, go to the repository page, click the green \"Code\" button, select the \"SSH\" option, and then copy the entire path from the textbox. Then use it in the example command below: almostengineer@aeoffice:~/trafficpi$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:almostengr/trafficpi.git If the command above has been done correctly, then run git remote -v and you should see the updated path as the destination of the remote. almostengineer@aeoffice:~/trafficpi$ git remote -v origin git@github.com:almostengr/trafficpi.git (fetch) origin git@github.com:almostengr/trafficpi.git (push) Final Push Once you have completed the above step, then you can do git push again.

For more information about the template, check out the video. Video Transcript (Unedited) between the last part and this part of the video series i was not able to figure out how to get the jumbotron to only show for one piece of content that is available so instead i'm going to take a different approach to that particular problem and continue building out the template for the mk docs website or blog that i'm building here we go [Music] all right so we're going to go ahead and jump right back into it all right here we were last from the last part of the series we're working on the jumbotron to get it to show just for the first piece of content instead i'm going to actually change the logic in here that post this jumbotron so i'm gonna leave what's in here here but instead i'm going to actually add an attribute in the page that will check to see if the item is set to be the featured piece of content and if it is set to be the feature piece of content then it will show on the page and what i'm going to do so i'm going to use nav child meta featured so that value does exist it will put the it as the jumbotron and the only thing is i'll just have to make sure that there are not two pages in here that have the feature tag as the jumbotron uh i mean excuse me there are not two pages that have the featured uh meta attribute set and that should be fairly difficult to do just got to make sure you got to remember what's there and remove the other one so i'm going to say feature true it could be yes it could be one whatever value goes there because they're not going to actually display the value we're just putting a value there so that it knows that something needs to be shown there all right and so here we have our one piece of content here now let's go back to the page here and we're going to actually change the title and we're going to say nav child i'm going to nav child title and actually need to put that in braces title and i want to also put in the link to this particular page so we're going to do nav child dot url we're going to pipe that to url which is a special filtering mechanism that is used in the ninja templating engine and then for this one i'm going to actually use the um i'm actually going to make this an if condition here and what i want to do is actually put in the description for this page so we're going to take that out and we're going to check to see if the uh actually don't need two braces we just need one if nav child dot description excuse me now that meta dot description then you're going to display the dab child dot meta dot description and if there is nothing else there then we're going to do what was done down here with the truncating of the nav child content and i need to close this out so do and if with the parentheses there all right now here we have it and it's working correctly so we have the title of our post as well as the description of said post and how we're triggering that is again in the content we have a true flag in the meta here for featured and so with that there anytime that flag is there it will show true so the only thing is you just got to make sure that you don't have it set in that featured meta attribute in multiple places otherwise you will get multiple jumbotrons showing on the home page all right and to check the link so it does point to the red mountain park post and and going down you'll see at the top of the page here we actually have the post show the title of the page showing up twice and that's something i'm gonna have to fix next so if we go back to the this particular section here and here we have the page title and what it's doing is actually the page title is in the body content or the page content of that page and so what's happening is it's pulling the title and saying okay i see the title but then i'm posting it again because it's in the content or the body of the page and that's how we are getting this double page heading so what i need to do is actually to put a condition in here so that this does not happen and what i need to do is to actually so we need a if condition and um so i'm actually going to surround this block here and the reason being i'm going to do it this way is because if the page title is not in the metadata then it's going to show up in the body and what will happen is that actually will show up kind of weird in nature on the page so i want to actually enclose all of that into a single block that if the title is in the page itself and not in the metadata that is not showing all of this and coming out with a weird output like this the long-term fix would be to actually go back and correct the content that is set up this way so that we don't have that problem going forward but right now i'm gonna go ahead and code this fix in as i want to be able to show you all how to do this on your particular setup what we're going to check is if the page dot meta dot title attribute does exist and [Music] we want to do page dot meta dot title and then we also want to show the metadata and i'm putting all of that the h2 and everything else in here inside like this for a on purpose um really this actually should also come think of it should be a h1 not an h2 because it is the page title so now that i've corrected that i'm going to go ahead and get this to correct that and i have saved the page so if we go back and refresh it let's see did i mistype something oh so i have the title here as well as that so what i need to do is also make another condition in here that will uh if the metadata title is present and [Music] i guess that's that yeah what i actually need to do is just remove it here from the page and that should correct that issue that with the title showing twice and as you see it has now what i was talking about earlier is let's put that back temporarily and remove this one and it should now not show the credits and it doesn't as you see it just only shows the title and that's what i want it to do all right so let's remove this and we also need to [Music] change this to posted i like to also have updated on here updated 2020 what's today 20 20 uh 09.06 is the current date and time and if we go back to here so we have the posted date and time and then i also want to include the updated date and time because sometimes you'll write a post but then that posts you something in that post is incorrect or the data in there has changed or something of that nature and if that's the case i want to make those necessary updates so i'm going to do if condition meta dot uh updated so past tense and then i want to do similar to how i have the above element with the posted date so page.meta.updated and then do a closing and if on this the jinjo2 template does have a date time available in here where you can do a filtering of a time pattern i don't do that but if you wanted to you could do that and i'm also going to put updated here so that you clearly know that this is the updated time and i want to put yeah okay so if the updated time updated date rather that's been provided then there it is all right and let's see i think that is sufficient so should be good so here we have the date posted by who yours truly and updated on today at the time of this recording and so here's that full post that you have there all right so let's go back to the home page so we have our featured content up here which is pretty great and we have our list of posts down here um i actually think i want to get rid of this sidebar and probably actually move this to a separate page that way i have a single column website that is capable of well it's already bootstrapped so it can already resize for any type of device that is being used for but i wanted to be able to have a single column website that way it's less to manage because when you have the sidebars over here it's somewhat a little bit more complex but not severely complex bootstrap makes it a little bit easier to deal with that being said i'm going to actually move so we can move this elsewhere block down to the bottom of the page so let's go and grab this content block here or this div and i want to move it within the nav so here's the closing div for the main navigation section or excuse me the main page body and i'm going to take this class off because i don't well i'm going to leave that class there and i want to actually add a horizontal row here class uh call it order border danger i believe is what i'm looking for here with this one and let's see if we get a red line there yes so now that i have that there i can actually go and take these two blocks off the side and just comment that section and i actually need to let's move that down a line and now see there we go comment that section almost not quite okay i guess because i have the commented section in the middle that when i try to hit the shortcut it's not liking it so much so now that we have that out of the way we need to actually come up here and change the div on this container [Music] to take up the full width of the screen and there you have it all right now if i have some additional blocks i can drop these down here at the bottom if i choose which is what i think i'm gonna do i'm actually going to uh spaces out and put a bg we'll go with light on this one just to see how it looks and i'm probably going to do a empty div [Music] between the main and go back to class with a i believe it's a margin if not is padding to get kind of a gap yeah and it's kind of difficult to see let me change that to vg dark so you can see it a little bit better all right so you see there's white space in between the x the footer and then this next block or section of the page another thing about it i don't like that red line there if i have this darker background here and so that will get things through this particular page i mean excuse me this particular section um the next thing that i'm gonna have to do is actually go back through and check the links on the page and the reason being is because i move the content around that's kind of more of a manual process you could write a shell script that would be able to handle that and i may actually end up doing that in this case um but it's a little bit more difficult to do and whatnot and so i want to test out the bootstrap part of this where it may show where it will resize and as you see it's resizing pretty well and let's open this back out all right so for the there was a nav section up here at the top that was commented out earlier i'm actually go ahead and bring it back okay not sure what i did all right so here we go so let's try to bring this back and in case you're wondering i actually use visual studio at uh sometimes and so as you see me typing this some of the shortcuts in visual studio are slightly different than those in visual studio code and so you'll see the screen randomly jump is because i actually hit the wrong shortcut and so it's doing something completely different than what i intended um just know i'm not just messing up things on purpose here all right so next i'm going to disable some of this stuff here for right now and i'm going to actually go ahead and change some of these uh links that are here so go about and do contact on this one and just as a helpful tip if you do not have about or contact pages on your website google will actually penalize you for the lack of those pages because it considers those two pages to be critical for every website again about and contact pages are critical for every website according to google that being said create them even if you don't have a lot of content on them you need to create them and have links to them from pretty much any page on the site because as google crawls the site it will look for those pages and if you're trying to come up in the blogging world those two pages and seo will be a critical factor in what you are able to get in terms of seo rankings as you see i don't have any contact on i mean content on my contact or any content on my about pages i will be fixing that but not in the video all right and if i wanted to add other categories or sections to the site i could do that i'll probably go back and tweak this so that i have pages for each category and have them to be able to be accessed from the navigation bar up here as you see but right now the remaining text will remain there it'll just be commented out and i really want to i don't want to have this justified with the content in between i really want it centered so i'm going to change this to text center and if i come back uh looks like i got the wrong bootstrap [Music] class is it centered i believe it might be center oh okay uh a line item center maybe that's what it all right so yeah justify okay it looks like i'm missing i have somewhere i thought i had it maybe i don't okay let me go look back into other code and see this is one of the main reasons that you want to be able to keep your existing code so text center does exist okay maybe it's just not working for this this is one of the main reasons you want to be able to keep your existing code and be able to reference your existing code because sometimes you may make a mistake like this or you know have some uncertainty like this and it's still justifying which i'm not sure why and it might be because of this flexboxes here and that's fine i will just remove that for now um well worst case scenario you can go to the bootstrap website and reference the information that they have there about the classes and so forth so if you go to documentation text alignment is what i am looking for and text center is the correct thing that i should be using but for reasons that i don't understand um and it might again might be because of this d flex let's see what happens with that if i take that out and take this out and replace it with the text center all right so it's still justifying to the left and if i do margin auto margin x auto i believe this is okay still not doing what i wanted to do that's fine i will actually just undo this for the time being because i do have these other links that i also want to leverage in here so it'll be fine if i put those more links in there but right now with it spaced out you know all the way across the screen like that it's kind of a looks kind of weird that you got those two links so far apart from each other all right and let's see what else can we do so i do want to monetize this site what i will do is i will put another block down here i'm not going to do that on video because of the amount of stuff i had to go through to get to the monetization code but it essentially would be another block that goes down here on the page or even at the bottom of the page here that you can put a ad banner there if you have a blog i do recommend suggesting monetizing your blog and that way you're able to make some money you may not make a lot of money off of it but you are making some money off the content that you are creating however if you're not interested in monetization don't worry about it but it's an easy way to make a little bit of passive income you know even if you're only getting five bucks a month five bucks can probably get you a lunch or a snack or something you know for your efforts and your knowledge sharing and it's also kind of uh in my opinion a good way of using that to your advantage because you're able to the more the more content that you create that is useful to the community whichever community you're in whether you're in technology whether you're in gardening the more content that you create and the more people you bring to your site the more money you get in return because of that and so i just kind of see it as a positive picture for that so in the end i'm going to go ahead and close out this series if you want to check out the sites once i finish everything completely completely like the bulk of the work is done if you want to see final tweaks and so forth that i've done you can go check out this particular blog it'll be a link down in the description below this blog is hosted on my github page or github on my github pages and you can check it out you can also look at the finalized template that source code will also be available in the uh almost encr.github.io repository again the link to that will be down in the description below hopefully you have good success in building your site out and i've given you some insight into how to build a template using mk docs with the ninja templating engine if you have any questions

page body and i'm going to take this class off because i don't well i'm going to leave that class there and i want to actually add a horizontal row here class uh call it order border danger i believe is what i'm looking for here with this one and let's see if we get a red line there yes so now that i have that there i can actually go and take these two blocks off the side and just comment that section and i actually need to let's move that down a line and now see there we go comment that section almost not quite okay i guess because i have the commented section in the middle that when i try to hit the shortcut it's not liking it so much so now that we have that out of the way we need to actually come up here and change the div on this container [Music] to take up the full width of the screen and there you have it all right now if i have some additional blocks i can drop these down here at the bottom if i choose which is what i think i'm gonna do i'm actually going to uh spaces out and put a bg we'll go with light on this one just to see how it looks and i'm probably going to do a empty div [Music] between the main and go back to class with a i believe it's a margin if not is padding to get kind of a gap yeah and it's kind of difficult to see let me change that to vg dark so you can see it a little bit better all right so you see there's white space in between the x the footer and then this next block or section of the page another thing about it i don't like that red line there if i have this darker background here and so that will get things through this particular page i mean excuse me this particular section um the next thing that i'm gonna have to do is actually go back through and check the links on the page and the reason being is because i move the content around that's kind of more of a manual process you could write a shell script that would be able to handle that and i may actually end up doing that in this case um but it's a little bit more difficult to do and whatnot and so i want to test out the bootstrap part of this where it may show where it will resize and as you see it's resizing pretty well and let's open this back out all right so for the there was a nav section up here at the top that was commented out earlier i'm actually go ahead and bring it back okay not sure what i did all right so here we go so let's try to bring this back and in case you're wondering i actually use visual studio at uh sometimes and so as you see me typing this some of the shortcuts in visual studio are slightly different than those in visual studio code and so you'll see the screen randomly jump is because i actually hit the wrong shortcut and so it's doing something completely different than what i intended um just know i'm not just messing up things on purpose here all right so next i'm going to disable some of this stuff here for right now and i'm going to actually go ahead and change some of these uh links that are here so go about and do contact on this one and just as a helpful tip if you do not have about or contact pages on your website google will actually penalize you for the lack of those pages because it considers those two pages to be critical for every website again about and contact pages are critical for every website according to google that being said create them even if you don't have a lot of content on them you need to create them and have links to them from pretty much any page on the site because as google crawls the site it will look for those pages and if you're trying to come up in the blogging world those two pages and seo will be a critical factor in what you are able to get in terms of seo rankings as you see i don't have any contact on i mean content on my contact or any content on my about pages i will be fixing that but not in the video all right and if i wanted to add other categories or sections to the site i could do that i'll probably go back and tweak this so that i have pages for each category and have them to be able to be accessed from the navigation bar up here as you see but right now the remaining text will remain there it'll just be commented out and i really want to i don't want to have this justified with the content in between i really want it centered so i'm going to change this to text center and if i come back uh looks like i got the wrong bootstrap [Music] class is it centered i believe it might be center oh okay uh a line item center maybe that's what it all right so yeah justify okay it looks like i'm missing i have somewhere i thought i had it maybe i don't okay let me go look back into other code and see this is one of the main reasons that you want to be able to keep your existing code so text center does exist okay maybe it's just not working for this this is one of the main reasons you want to be able to keep your existing code and be able to reference your existing code because sometimes you may make a mistake like this or you know have some uncertainty like this and it's still justifying which i'm not sure why and it might be because of this flexboxes here and that's fine i will just remove that for now um well worst case scenario you can go to the bootstrap website and reference the information that they have there about the classes and so forth so if you go to documentation text alignment is what i am looking for and text center is the correct thing that i should be using but for reasons that i don't understand um and it might again might be because of this d flex let's see what happens with that if i take that out and take this out and replace it with the text center all right so it's still justifying to the left and if i do margin auto margin x auto i believe this is okay still not doing what i wanted to do that's fine i will actually just undo this for the time being because i do have these other links that i also want to leverage in here so it'll be fine if i put those more links in there but right now with it spaced out you know all the way across the screen like that it's kind of a looks kind of weird that you got those two links so far apart from each other all right and let's see what else can we do so i do want to monetize this site what i will do is i will put another block down here i'm not going to do that on video because of the amount of stuff i had to go through to get to the monetization code but it essentially would be another block that goes down here on the page or even at the bottom of the page here that you can put a ad banner there if you have a blog i do recommend suggesting monetizing your blog and that way you're able to make some money you may not make a lot of money off of it but you are making some money off the content that you are creating however if you're not interested in monetization don't worry about it but it's an easy way to make a little bit of passive income you know even if you're only getting five bucks a month five bucks can probably get you a lunch or a snack or something you know for your efforts and your knowledge sharing and it's also kind of uh in my opinion a good way of using that to your advantage because you're able to the more the more content that you create that is useful to the community whichever community you're in whether you're in technology whether you're in gardening the more content that you create and the more people you bring to your site the more money you get in return because of that and so i just kind of see it as a positive picture for that so in the end i'm going to go ahead and close out this series if you want to check out the sites once i finish everything completely completely like the bulk of the work is done if you want to see final tweaks and so forth that i've done you can go check out this particular blog it'll be a link down in the description below this blog is hosted on my github page or github on my github pages and you can check it out you can also look at the finalized template that source code will also be available in the uh almost encr.github.io repository again the link to that will be down in the description below hopefully you have good success in building your site out and i've given you some insight into how to build a template using mk docs with the ninja templating engine if you have any questions put them down below i do read the comments i do answer the comments if you learned something from this video or interested in more videos like this please give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe i drop new videos every week on tuesday

A coding challenge strives to test ones ability to be able to solve a problem using a defined set of criteria. Often times, coding challenges that you will find online are used as interview questions, such as Fizz-Buzz . Why Do Challenges I periodically do coding challenges. The reason that I do challenges is to test my knowledge of the programming language and expose myself to different aspects of the language. For instance, I primarily build web applications using .NET Core MVC. Most of the coding challenges that I do, consists of working with console applications. While both of these use the same programming language, they are very different in their architecture. In my blog post about getting a tech job without experience , I mentioned that you will get better and more opportunities if you are specialist instead of being a jack of all trades. Thus why I do all of the challenges presented in C# instead of Python or other languages that others insist that they should be done in. Challenge Ideas Online Sources For those of you that struggle to come up with ideas to do for a coding challenge, then look online. Websites like Upwork have requests and job submitted where freelancers are paid to various projects. Often times these project listings have the basics for what it is needed and some unknowns. As for the unknowns, answer or make them up as you go. After all you are doing this for practice and not getting paid, so having an imagination will not cost you. Homework Assignments You can take a homework assignment that someone had for their class and turn that into a coding challenge. Many times, programming courses have their assignments and other materials online hosted by a college or university's website. If you can find one of those websites, then do the work listed there. Refactor Code To Another Language One way that you can better your skills in a certain programming language, is to refactor code in another programming language into the language of your choosing. If someone is doing a challenge in Python and you are learning Java, then do that same challenge in Java. By doing this, the following will happen: expand your knowledge on the language that you are working in learn another programming language the differences between programming languages All of the above will make you a better programmer and expand your knowledge at the same time. Submit A Challenge I take challenge ideas. If you have an idea for a challenge, you can file an issue on my coding challenge repository and I will look into completing it. If the challenge is interesting enough, I may even post me working on the challenge on my YouTube Channel . Completed Challenges You can find all of the coding challenges that I have completed in my coding challenge repo .","title":"Why Do Coding Challenges?"},{"location":"technology/2021.06.25-why-do-coding-challenges/#why-do-challenges","text":"I periodically do coding challenges.

More and more restaurants have sign or something similar that has a QR code on it that will take you to a web page that has the restaurant's menu. At Lowell's Restaurant in Seattle, Washington , the table that they sat us at had the QR code between two windows. Following with the trend of COVID, they no longer had traditional menus. Instead they had QR codes that a customer would scan to pull up the menu. This is a effort that I have seen several restaurants do in an effort to reduce the risk of transmitting COVID between customers. It does have some flaws and ways it can be improved. Silhouette My camera phone had the hardest time trying to capture the QR code so that it could take me to the online menu. As you see form the photo above, you can barely see the QR on the pillar between the windows. This is known as a silhouette. Because there is a significant amount of light behind the subject that you are attempting to photograph, the camera struggles to see target object. To get this same effect with the human eye, go into a dark or dimly lit area. Then point a flashlight at your eyes and try to see beyond the flashlight. You will struggle to do so because your eyes have adapted to the flashlight because of its brightness. In this case, the placement of the QR code is in the worse possible location. Ideally it would have been better to tape it to the table or place it in a stand up picture frame. Include Text URL What would have made this process less frustrating have been to have the URL address next to the QR code. While some phones are good at take pictures, they may not be as great with scanning QR codes. In my opinion, the best alternative to this is to have the URL listed next to the QR code. That way if a customer, like myself in this case, has an issue with scanning the QR code, then they can still access the menu online by typing in the URL. Disposable Menus One of the waiters did realize that were having issues with scanning the QR code. Thus he came by the table and offered a paper menu for us to use. This, while it may increase the cost to the business by having to dispose of the menu once a customer has used it, still allows for customers who are having difficulties or may have left their phones at home to be able to place an order. Conclusion Hopefully restaurant owners will be more conscious about the placement of their QR codes if they are using them in an effort to maek the customer experience better.","title":"Importance of QR Code Placement"},{"location":"technology/2021.07.01-importance-of-qr-code-placement/#silhouette","text":"My camera phone had the hardest time trying to capture the QR code so that it could take me to the online menu.

The plugin does not have a build in method that will do date comparisons, so I had to create my own. First resource was to look a thte Jquery documentation. That didn't serve much help because it does not have useful examples that show how the code can be implemented. Eventually I did find a post on Stack Overflow, in the answers section, that gave an idea on how it should work. From that, I was able to roll my own solution to the problem that I had. Since I had such difficulty finding examples of how to do this, I decided to post the solution that I was able to come up with here so that I and others can use it for future reference. $.validator.addMethod('dateAfterOrEqualTo', function (value, element, params) { if (value == '' || params[0].val() == '') return true; const firstDate = new Date(value), secondDate = new Date(params[0].val()); return firstDate >= secondDate; }, 'Date needs to be after or equal to second date.', ); The JQuery rule look like this. // rest of code goes here rules: { leadingDate: { dateAfterOrEqualTo: [$('#postDate')] } } // rest of code goes here Thus when you run the code above, it will take the value from the field that the rule is being applied to and the value from another field that you choose, convert them both to dates, and then compare them to each other. From there, you can use your own error message or include one in the addMethod like I have done above.","title":"JQuery Validator with Parameter"},{"location":"technology/2021.11.26-find-sql-server-procedure-or-function-contents/","text":"Find SQL Server Stored Procedure or Function By Contents Problem I was working making changes to a table function that is in a SQL Server database. This update was being made on an application that previously existed. Thus I did not have extensive knowledge of the database structure and each time I would add a feature to the application, I would have to research how things were previously done since we are using an existing database. One aspect of this was that I wanted to find whether a table function was being used by more than one stored procedure. A function called by a stored procedure? Yes... do not ask. I did not write the original code, but am trying to make improvements where I can with the replacement applicatoin. That said, I did not know of a command that would provide me this information. Solution After doing some internet research for this type of problem, I did find a query that would get me what I needed. The query is: The Query select * from sys.sql_modules m inner join sys.objects o on o.object_id = m.object_id where m.definition like '<text>' Replace <text> with the name of or the contents of the procedure or function.

One of those projects, related to the Christmas Light Show called Falcon Pi Twitter , has custom built software that runs it. When a question gets asked about how my show is set up, I share the details about the electrical aspect of it and the Twitter application that posts the song data. When they hear about the Twitter account and how it works to post the information about the current song, questions roll in. I realize that this could be a valuable opportunity to make this application into a full, open source application that can be used by other individuals that use the Falcon Pi Player as part of their light show. One aspect of creating software is that you have to do releases and with releases, are release numbers. There are many release number strategies, but I wanted to share the one that I chose and why I chose it. Semantic Versioning From what I have been able to find, there are multiple ways of doing semantic versioning. There\u2019s the major.minor.build major.minor.patch major.minor and the list goes on. With this pattern, only one of the numbers change when there is a release and the number that changes depends on what was done as part of that release. This in my opinion was a bit more than what I was looking to have with my application because thought to know what was changed, cannot be easily scripted to update the version number, and can make your application look outdated although it just had a release. Calendar Versioning This strategy names the version number based on the date that the release was built or make available. Like the Semantic Versioning, there are variations of this versioning as well. They are year.month year.month.date year.month.patch This pattern has multiple strategies. Most common with this strategy is that there is one feature release per month or per day, and bugs fix releases are done between feature releases of they are severe enough. This pattern is also easy to come up with the release number as you only have to pull the current date. You know how old the latest release is because the year and month that it was released is in the version number. My Choice: Calendar Versioning I decided to go with calendar versioning because it is easy to set up with scripts and does not require that you have to know whether a bug or feature was added to the application. The pattern that I decided to go with is year.month.date It is highly unlikely that I would do multiple releases within the same day, but is possible that I do multiple within the same month with new features and bug fixes. It Looks Like Semantic Version Number The only problem with this is that it looks like Semantic Versioning with the 3-digit version number. From what I have seen, as part of the application's documentation, the version number scheme is sometimes included, especially if it is following a \"year.month\" or similar strategy. The difference in my opinion is that most can tell that it is a calendar versioning because the first digit of the pattern is usually a year, not a single- or double-digit number. One exception to this is Ubuntu's versioning method. They use the 2-digit year as the first number instead of the 4-digit year. I'll be using a four-digit year as part of my versioning pattern. Breaking Changes A point that is made by those who create software is that calendar versioning does not help developers that are not working on the application know when there are breaking changes or features added. In my opinion, this is true. Knowing what features have been added or bugs have been fixed is part of the release notes. Version numbers do help with finding that information fast, but ultimately as a developer, one should be reviewing the release note and application documentation to see what has changed and how to update their code regarding the new changes.","title":"Calendar Versioning Works"},{"location":"technology/2021.12.12-calendar-versioning-works/#semantic-versioning","text":"From what I have been able to find, there are multiple ways of doing semantic versioning.
