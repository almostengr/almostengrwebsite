If I open the door while standing on the other side of the house, I barely hear it running. The deadbolt on the door is louder than the door moving.</p> <p>The opener was very easy to install. If you already have a garage door installed, adding  this opener can be done as a DIY task on a Saturday. I already had most of necessary tools to complete the job, including a drill, sockets, and wire strippers. I did have to use some two by fours to mount some of the hardware to as my garage door is mounted to the two by fours and not flush with the wall.</p> <p>The opener kit that i purchased came with the Internet gateway. This is great as it allows you to open the door when you are not at home to let the repairman or kids in when you are not there.</p> <p>This model supports the battery backup so that you can get in the garage while the power is out. I do not have the battery backup, but it can be purchased as an add on if I chose to change my mind in the future.</p> <p>It doesn't take up as much space as convention chain garage door openers.</p> <p>In my garage, I have a ceiling fan that the previous home owners had installed. Installing a conventional garage opener would have meant that the ceiling fan would have to be removed. Let's just say working in a garage during an Alabama summer when the humidity can be 90% and the temp 95 degrees, the fan is clutch.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2018.01.20-1-year-review-of-liftmaster-8500-with-myq-internet-gateway-handyman/#the-cons","title":"The Cons","text":"<p>Sometimes when you go to open the door, the door opens as it should, but the light doesn't always turn on. However when the door reaches the top, the light will turn on.</p> <p>I believe that part of the reason that the light doesn't turn on is because the light is radio controlled. In other words, when you press the button on the remote or door control, the opener sends a radio signal to the light to switch on. As you may know, radio signals are always subject to interference with other radio signals and electrical wiring. This is a minor problem.</p> <p>If you partially open the door, the MyQ app will not alert you that the door is partially open. This is clearly a security risk to your home.</p> <p>For instance, if someone opens the door and stops it part of the way, you will not receive a notification on your phone or email regarding this. I did check the MyQ message board and saw that others have complained about this and a Liftmaster representative responded. However Liftmaster hasn't provide an update to this defect.</p> <p>The MyQ app doesn't always close the door back immediately after it has opened.</p> <p>With my android phone, if I press the button on my phone to close the door within 20 seconds of it being opened, the door doesn't close.</p> <p>However if I force close the app, reopen it, and then press the button to close the door, the door proceeds to close.

THIS ON THE SIDE WHILE YOU'RE FLUSHING THE TOILET YOU PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE THE GASKET I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP HOW TO REPLACE THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLTS I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION LISTED ON THE PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK THE WATER UP STEP 3 DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT STEP 5 REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE THE OLD GASKET IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO IT BEING STRETCHED AND BEING IN USE FOR A WHILE THE NEW GAS THAT IS SMALLER BUT SHOULD FIT AS IT IS MADE OUT OF RUBBER STEP 6 INSTALL THE NEW GASKET THE NEW GASKET GOES OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND YOU MAY HAVE TO STRETCH IT TO FIT AS I DID IN MY CASE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO STRETCH IT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASILY AS IT IS A RUBBER GASKET ONCE YOU GET IT ON MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH PUSH IT ALL THE WAY DOWN IN AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO SPACE OR ROOM FOR LEAKAGE STEP 7 CLEAN THE MOUNTING POINTS AS YOU SEE THE MOUNTING POINTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BOLT ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET IS VERY DIRTY AND EVEN WITH SOME BLACK CORROSION BE SURE TO CLEAN THESE OFF AS YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CLEAN SO THAT IT MAKES A GREAT SEAL WHEN WHEN CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER IF YOU LEAVE ANY DIRT BEHIND IT MAY NOT CONNECT AS WELL AND YOU STILL MAY END UP HAVING A LEAK AFTER YOU GET DONE STEP 8 INSTALL THE NEW BOLTS SO BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE BOLT AND PUT IN THE RUBBER WASHER AND YOU PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOLT HEAD AND THEN LAYING THE TANK DOWN YOU'LL SIT THE BOLT THROUGH THE BOLT HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL AND THERE'S TWO OF THESE SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS PROCESS TWICE ONE FOR THE LEFT ONE FOR THE RIGHT THEN IF YOU NEED TO YOU CAN ADD THE WASHER AND THE NUT ON THE BOTTOM ON THE PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAVE IT STATED THAT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONFIGURATION OF HOW THE TOILET IS BUILT SINCE MY TOILET PREVIOUSLY HAD A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION I DECIDED TO INSTALL A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS LOCATION STEP 9 INSTALL THE TANK SO TAKE THE TANK MAKE SURE YOU LINE THE BOLT HOLES UP AND LAY IT ON THE OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE TOILET FLANGE YOU MAY WANT TO ROCK IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ACTUALLY SEALS IN VERY WELL STEP 10 INSTALL WASHERS AND NUTS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL WASHERS AND NUTS THAT GO UNDER THE TANK ITSELF THAT CONNECT THE TANK TO THE ACTUAL PART OF THE BOWL IN THE REAR YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THESE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER WITH A RUBBER WASHER ON TOP A METAL WASHER NEXT TO THAT AND THEN FINALLY THE NUT AT THE END BE SURE TONIGHT OVER-TIGHTEN BEAT THE NUT AT THE END BECAUSE IF YOU OVER TIGHTEN IT YOU CAN CORRECT A CERAMIC ON THE TOILET AND IF YOU PRACTICE CERAMIC OF THE TOILET YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER TOILET IT IS PREFERRED THAT YOU DO A HAND TIGHTEN ONLY AS YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED AND CAN STOP APPLYING PRESSURE BEFORE THE CERAMIC CRACKS STEP 11 RECONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE SO AS YOU DID THE DISCONNECT OF THE SUPPLY LINE YOU BASICALLY UNDO WHAT YOU PROVEN IS DONE SO REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP 12 TURN ON THE WATER I RECOMMEND TURNING ON THE WATER MAYBE A HALF TO ONE TURN AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE NO LEAKS OR YOU DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TURNING FURTHER IF YOU TURN IT ALL THE WAY ON AND IT STARTS LEAKING THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ALL THE WAY BACK OFF THEREFORE YOU CREASE THE CHANCES OF GETTING WATER ON YOUR FLOOR AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT IS NOT WANTED STEP 13 FLUSH AND CHECK THE LEAKS ONCE YOU VERIFY THAT THERE IS NO MORE LEAKS THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL ALSO IF YOU LIKE INSTANT NOTIFICATIONS CLICK THE

I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case. For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that\u2019s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side. I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row. If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks that you need.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.11-building-raised-garden-beds/#step-2-time-to-go-shopping","title":"Step 2: Time To Go Shopping","text":"<p>For this project, you will need the following:</p> <p>(Please consider using the affiliate links below this post.

The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking. Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free. Next I tried to push down the branch. However this did not work as I was not able to get much leverage from pushing. In addition, the limb would slide back after pushing. Since that attempt failed, I got a tow rope and connected it to the tree. The tow rope was slick, so I put a shovel on the other end of the rope to use it as a handle. After a number of pulls, I was able to get the branch down on the ground so that it can be removed and no longer a safety hazard.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.19-containers-vs-in-ground-gardening/","title":"Containers vs In Ground Gardening","text":"<p>If you live in a small space container gardening works very great. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to doing container gardening or gardening in pots versus putting your fruits and vegetables directly into the ground. In this post I'm a cover those differences that I've experienced with my growing experiences.</p> <p>So for the past several years I have been growing all of my purse and vegetables in containers instead of the putting them directly in the ground. However, I have noticed that my neighbor has majority of his plant directly in the ground or in raised beds. So after doing some years of research of just only planting in containers or pots these are some things that I've noticed about this process.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.19-containers-vs-in-ground-gardening/#the-benefits","title":"The Benefits","text":"<p>Having your plant in a container versus directly in the ground allows you to better customize the soil to based upon the plant that is that particular container. For instance blueberries have a tendency to prefer more acidic soil versus less a tomato plants. That being said if you have a blueberry plant in just a specific container you can adjust the ratios of your soil so that it is acidic versus having an entire bed that has to be adaptable to a wide variety of everything that you put in that bed.</p> <p>Another benefit of planting in containers is that you can move the container or wherever you need to depending upon the time of year. For instance some plants require more sun song require more shade.  As the seasons change you can move the plant to a more shaded area if the plant actually needs more shade or move it to a more Sunny your area and if it needs more sun.</p> <p>Growing in containers actually can restrict the limit of how far the plants can grow out. For instance peppermint plants, is a very vine-like plant. That being said I planted a peppermint plant in a container of about two years ago and after about a year to a year-and-a-half, the peppermint plant had actually become almost root bound in that container.  In addition, the peppermint plant itself was actually trying to grow out of the container but it wasn't able to do so since the container was fairly high off the ground and it wasn't able to actually take root into the ground itself.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.03.19-containers-vs-in-ground-gardening/#the-negatives","title":"The Negatives","text":"<p>The major thing that I've noticed about container gardening is that the soil in the containers have a tendency to dry out faster during hotter weather. The reason is that the pot only can hold so much water and once that water start to evaporate it can't pull water from anywhere else. In my scenario from the last several years, I've actually had to make sure that I watered the container plants every day or every other day and depending upon the temperature and when the last time it rained.</p> <p>Another negative that exist with using containers or pots is that when the weather becomes very severe that the container can actually flip over depending on is dementia. I've used 5-gallon buckets and the five gallon buckets during severe weather in Alabama can lead up to winds in the 40 or more mile an hour range. With these high winds or higher winds, this can result in the plant being knocked over and dirt falling out as well as any reserve water being knocked out as well.</p> <p>This past winter, I noticed that the birds that were migrating through my area would land in the yard and go under the plants that were directly into the ground however they would not go into the ones that were in containers or pots. I'm not sure why that was the case, but it may have had something to do with the birds not being able to see what is in the pot before they go flying into it.  Now you may think that birds being able to get into a pot is very insignificant, but they actually play a major role in farming and gardening. In my experience has the birds actually eat the pests like ladybugs, caterpillars, and horn worms, just to name a few, that would normally attack the leaves on the plants that you are growing.</p> <p>With all this being said, this year I will be growing with a combination of in ground beds as well as containers and pots.  Hopefully this has given you a good perspective of the differences between growing in the ground versus growing in a container or a pot.

Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used in some type of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them.

However if you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added. Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally do not come with soil or from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients.

Usually, I'll park in between the road and the store. The rule that I do follow is that I do not drive down more than two (2) aisles when looking for a parking space. Not only does riding around looking for the closest parking space waste gas, it also and reduce the number of steps that you get.

If you believe my experience is flawed, there is a survey that was done by QSR Magazine that stated that the drive-thru line wait time increased from 2013 to 2014 by 40 seconds. In addition, sitting in the drive through wastes gas unless you are driving an electric, hybrid, or auto-stop vehicle. Next time that you go to a fast-food restaurant, as you walk into the restaurant and take note of the last car that is in the drive through line and see if you walk out of the restaurant before the car gets out of the drive thru.

I'm going to show you how to go around and identify the outlets and the lights and which breaker they are connected to in your breaker panel.  Thanks for tuning in. if you have not already please subscribe down in the button below. so when you go to do electrical work i.e. if you're changing out a light switch if a plug has an issue and you're trying to diagnose it or even if you're trying to add a circuit or even if you're trying to add an outlet to a room or somewhere else I say you want to add an outlet behind the TV, you need to go to your breaker panel and identify where this is connected to in your breaker panel. however if your breaker panel is unlabeled this can be very difficult as and it was in my case because only three of about the 20 to 30 breakers in my panel were actually labeled. a lot of times it was easier just to turn off everything in the breaker panel instead of just finding that one circuit that needs to be turned off. so in this video I'm going to actually go and tell you how I went about identifying The Breakers in my panel and what they were connected to.  in particular the ones that do not have labels. there is a warning with this is that if you are not familiar or comfortable working around electricity this is best done by professional. however if you have some familiarity with the electricity then you can do this yourself.</p> <p>the tools that you need to complete this task are a non-contact voltage tester or a voltmeter a notepad and a writing utensil whether it be a pen or pencil now you can do this task by yourself as I did however if you have somebody that can help you to actually does all the running around or can be inside of the building to identify which lights turn on and which lights turn off that would be far easier than you having to go from panel back inside to figure out where it is and then go back to the panel and then go back in again to try to identify which wipes for Outlets have turned on or turned off so let's begin so first thing I did of course is go to the breaker panel and open it up as you can see my breaker panel is actually outside initially when I did I turn off all of the breakers only their realize later on that some of the breakers are not wired up in more modern electrical panels there's usually a main breaker at the very top however for some reason to main breaker in my panel is right along in series with the rest of the breakers so when I turned everything off and we'll try to turn on only one breaker at a time and go back inside none of the stuff with work so this is my non-contact voltage tester is also a voltmeter and so by turning everything off and then typing everything up to the breaker panel I can confirm that there was no electricity in a breaker panel and then I can go over to the meter and the court the meter can't be turned off without the use of the power company and so I was non-contact voltage tester was working correctly so then the next thing was to go around through and identify each of the various devices and then once I verify to eat one then I will go and write that one down with the number of the breaker the amperage and then what that breaker was connected to or at least what I could dinner Phi that that breaker was connected to so this is basically you just walk up to it if you have the non-contact voltage tester and you just tap the put the voltage tester near the wires that come out of the particular device or Appliance and if it makes a noise then you know that it's working if it doesn't you know that that breaker that you switched off is what that is connected to and then you just make a note of that so some circuits are actually connected all together across multiple rooms so this is an example of a what is known as a lighting circuit and basically all the circuits are all the items on a given breaker are connected to permanent light so if you flip a breaker off and all the lights in multiple rooms turn off at the same time that means that breaker is a dedicated lighting circuit so modern design dictates that you have a lighting circuit in place and the reason that you want to have a lighting circuit in place separate from your outlet is because less I you fuggin something and that particular item has a fault in the wiring within the device Itself by having the ability to have a lights on a separate breaker for the outlet if this happens I say this happens at night when you tripped the breaker the lights in the room will still be on the overhead lights or permanently mounted lights will still be on and so it allows you to be able to get out of the room safely because you can still see because those lights are on a separate circuit from the actual Outlets now</p> <p>On the breaker so what I'm doing now is actually taking off the front price on the breaker panel and so you'll want to be careful when doing this make sure you don't touch anything on the inside and it took a little bit of effort to get mine out since mine actually is recess inside some breaker panels actually have the front face mounted on the out outside so it doesn't actually slide off it just more like that of an outlet plug so if you notice here where the arrow is pointing this Breakers actually not connected and so this is one of the breakers that when I flipped it off I didn't do anything and I didn't know what it was connected to so I opened it up and sure enough it didn't do anything because it's not connected to anything and this may be the case was some of your Breakers in your panel if you had or somebody else who has lived there before you has done some remodeling and remove some of the wiring then or made adjustments to the wiring fan this may be the case in your scenario so just be sure to not touch any time any wires inside of the panel if you are checking to see if Breakers are connected then all you have to do is reinstall the panel and in my case I actually lost the screw that holds the face and place like they had to go and buy another screw from the hardware store it came in a pack of cigs so I only needed one but I have five extra screws just in case I do that again in the future so once you have identified all of the breakers that you have in your box and what they are connected to then you can go and create a spreadsheet with his information so that it can be printed out so I'm going to start by using the First Column as the number and Then followed by what that breaker is connected to Sobe description and then the amperage and if you notice that I'm using uppercase letters for this entire spreadsheet that will make it easier to read so I'm going to do the left side of the breaker which is all of the ones that are odd numbered starting with the top down you have one event all the way down to the harbor mini Breakers that you have on that particular side so on my outside the breaker number highest ranking number is 25 so I will stop at 25 and then I will start with the even numbers of 2 4 and 6 and I was like that and then use autocomplete to and at 26 which is the highest number that I have on the right hand side so the first record that I have in the number one position is the bath Outlet as well as the exterior Outlets saw internet in and then I will also include the amperage which is 28 and then I will go to the next one which is not connected so I'll just know that is not connected and then I will put in the next two are the air conditioner compressor or connected to the air conditioner compressor and then I will continue this process and then once I get all the way filled in down to 25 and print this out I will actually cut this between Rose 14 and 15 and I will actually add another header here on row 15 so insert an entire row and then copy this header here so that and I can add as actually had another roll so that I have some spacing in between so when I do go to cut this I don't have to be very exact with my cut and sew cut this between here and then so I have the even breakers on one side and then excuse me. Breakers on one side and then he even bring his on the other side now if you have a panel where the door opens sideways you could actually move emails over so that they are side-by-side like this and that way you can better see and then you only have to use one shut up a paper printout to do this however since my breaker panel actually opens up instead of to the left or to the right and going to do this way and split it sideways so I can put them side-by-side on next to space in between the edge of the breaker in the edge of the panel in the breaker itself so for the sales that are really long like this one and these here but I'm actually going to do is through this entire column and set it to do word wrap in LibreOffice calc need to go to text and a text under the format menu and then you can resize a column into text Will resize accordingly and so I'm going to actually shorten breaker number to this breaker and that way it'll allow me to use this room here I can you guys leave an abbreviated if you want to use for space and so I do have one breaker here that is a arc fault or ground-fault breaker breaker actually labeled in the end column that it isn't scription of that is our Breakers to clearly distinguish some reason this sale did not wrap correctly so you may have simply of formatting issues that come up like this and just have to go in and double check on them and if worst case we align the row to get it to do right to be here now is doing correctly are you in some places use the abbreviations to try to help with the wrapping so for instance here instead of spelling kitchen out I just took out all of the files that were in the word kitchen until you get something here that resembles the kitchen counter so counter counter I took out all the vowels yet again so you have cnpr you can kind of figure that out just no reasoning and same thing here with front how do you say it's not fully showing a hold of wrapping correctly so the same thing here with fry and so I will also do the headings on this one and make those bold you know that goes are there and then if you want to you can actually make these rolls alternate Colors video but it's pretty straightforward you know how to adjust the Lights theme background color of a particular role so that I can clearly read all the way across which role you know which item is so if I'm looking for the dryer and I can't cross here and say okay will dryer is 30 amps I can locate fryer bicep on the amperage or I can locate it based upon the position and once you have completed this be sure to save a copy of this in the reason I say that is cuz in the future if you happen to add breaker Outlets name something that say you add an outlet in a new room or you add an additional light in the new room then you know you can go here instead of retyping this all the way over you just make that necessary addition and then free printed back out and stick it back in your breaker box I'm out stop attic grid lines instead of using beat coloring technique will be far easier to read his follow your line finger across the line of the dates and that way you know somebody comes along in the future they won't have to guess when this was last updated though clearly so they know if anything has changed between this date and the current date of whenever they're looking at it then they can reprint this out and put a updated label inside a breaker box so as you see I've completed the printout of the stuff that I was going to do on the computer with the labeling then I've covered it in mailing tape as my breaker panel is outside hopefully this will protect it against the weather and any other elements that may come in contact with the labels I have a copy of this saved on my computer so I can go in and print out additional labels in the future if needed if I need to make any adjustments I can make those adjustments on the print out and then print them back out again this process has helped you in identifying and labeling your breaker panel if you have any questions or comments please leave those in the comments section below if this video has helped you please give this video a thumbs up.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.06.13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/","title":"3 Benefits of Doing Something Different When Stuck","text":"<p>As some of you may know, I build automations as part of my day job.

That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest.  This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf.

Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them.  In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019.11.24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#we-are-not-who-we-used-to-be-sometimes-we-become-lost","title":"We Are Not Who We Used To Be.

Once those errors are identified, they are corrected so that they do not occur again. Whether it be redrawing the bridge or redesigning a component of the plane, it has now become better and it is not what it used to be. In the movie, this was reflected by Christopher Robin going back to the Hundred Acre Wood.

It was a good message as it talked about how that we all have a past. However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6.</p> <p>I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>ONE DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT NEXT YOU'RE GONNA DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES THAT RUN TO THE CONTACTOR BECAUSE AFTER YOU GET ALL OF THE WIRES DISCONNECTED THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR FOR MY PARTICULAR SITUATION THE CONTACTOR HAD SCREWS ON THE CONNECTING POINT SOME OF THEM DID HAVE THESE WHAT I CALL QUICK CONNECTORS BUT OTHER ONES HAD SCREWS ON THEM SO FOR THOSE OF HOW THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CONTACTOR YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT ALL OF THE WIRES FROM THE CONTACTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT ALRIGHT FOLKS SO I GOT MY NEW CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE OVER HERE AND MY OLD CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE HERE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE SCREW ON THIS ONE ACTUALLY I HAD TO SCREW IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THERE SO BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THAT I'M NOTICED SO ON THE TOP OF THIS ONE ACTUALLY YOU STICK THE WIRE IN WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD A CLAMP THAT YOU PUT A CONNECTOR ON IT AND THEN YOU PUT THAT CONNECTOR AROUND THE SCREW HEAD SO THE TOP IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE THE BOTTOM NOW WHERE YOU STICK THE WHOLE WIRE IN AND THEN YOU SCREW THE TO CLAMP IT DOWN ALL THE WAY ALSO THE SAME NUMBER OF PINS HERE LOOKS TO BE THERE'S EIGHT ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S EIGHT ON THE TOP HERE I ONLY HAD I BELIEVE THOSE TWO WIRES HERE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE CONTACTOR ITSELF I WON'T BE USING ALL OF THOSE PINS SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE WIRES AND THIS ONE ALSO IS ENCLOSED SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE COIL ON THIS ONE FROM BOTH SIDES SO BUT YOU CAN ON THIS ONE AND THE REASON BEING IS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TOOK ACCOUNT THAT HEY BUGS CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THIS THING AND CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THEY ACTUALLY SEAL IT UP ENTIRELY SO ALL THIS MECHANICAL STUFF LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE IT'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS HOWEVER YOU CAN TAKE THESE TWO SCREWS OFF AND THIS PLAY TO COME UP AND THEN IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS INSIDE UNDERNEATH THIS COVER HERE SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW CONTACTOR AND THE OLD CONTACTOR AND ONE OTHER DIFFERENCE THEY DID NOT HAVE IF YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THIS ONE IS RATED AT 25 AMPS AND THIS ONE IS RATED AT 30 SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME RATING BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PART JUST THE WRITING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO AS YOU SEE IS STILL OPERATING WITH A 24 VOLT COIL LIKE THIS ONE IS HERE AND SO IT'S ALSO A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AND BE SURE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SCREWS BECAUSE THIS THING DOES HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND TRYING TO FIND THE SCREWS THAT MATCH OR WILL FIT ME HOLES THAT IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OR CONDENSER IS PRETTY DIFFICULT I'M YOU COULD USE ONE OF THE OTHER SCREWS AND PUT IT THERE BUT AGAIN THE HASSLE OF GOING THROUGH THE STORE AND TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER SCREW TO REPLACE THAT ONE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO ONCE YOU GET THE OLD ONE OUT YOU CAN PUT THE NEW ONE IN AND PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN IS THE REVERSE STEPS OF TAKING THE OLD ONE OUT AND MY PARTICULAR SCENARIO I HAD WIRES THAT BURNED I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS JUST AN ARC OR JUST CORROSION OR MAYBE EVEN A CRITTER OR SOMETHING GOT INTO THE EAR AND SHORTER THINGS OUT BUT NONETHELESS THE WIRES WERE BURNED AS I SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN THE VIDEO SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT MORE WIRE CUT OFF THE BURNT SECTION IDEALLY THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WIRE LEFT IN HERE IF NOT YOU MAY HAVE TO WHAT THEY CALL KIND OF LIKE PIGTAIL SO YOU PUT IN A NEW WIRE OF A LONGER LINK AND JOIN THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RESIZE IT BACK TO THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH BUT IN MY CASE I HAVE PLENTY OF WIRE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND SO THAT ADDING ADDITIONAL WIRE WAS NOT NECESSARY I WAS JUST ABLE TO CUT OFF WHAT I HAD AND WIRE IT IN THE CONTACTOR THAT I'M USING DOES NOT HAVE THE QUICK CONNECTORS ON IT OR REQUIRED THAT THEY BE USED AND SO WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WAS TO STICK THE CONNECTOR I'M EXCUSE ME TO STICK THE WIRE INTO THE HOLE AND THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW DOWN AND THAT HELD THE WIRE IN PLACE TO THE CONNECTOR SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT QUICK CONNECTOR ON THERE ANYMORE ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING CONNECTED YOU'LL NEED TO REARRANGE THE WIRES AND SECURE THEM BACK INSIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE OR THE PANEL IDEALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER IF YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES ORIGINALLY BEFORE I PULL THIS PANEL UP ALL THE WIRES WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER IN A LARGE BUNDLE WITH A ZIP TIE SO TRY TO PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE YOU START MESSING WITH IT THAT WAY YOU CAN ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE I HAVE THE ENTIRE WIRE SET WRAPPED IN BUNDLES I MEAN EXCUSE ME WRAPPED IN ZIP WITH A SINGLE ZIP TIE LIKE IT WAS BEFORE AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING FITS THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE I STARTED MESSING WITH THINGS AND THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE CROSSED OVER OR ALL THOSE TYPE OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHORT OUT THE SYSTEM OR CAUSE YOURSELF FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT YOU OR A TECHNICIAN MAY HAVE TO FIX ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE WIRES IN PLACE AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO THEN GO FLIP ON THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS AS IT SHOULD ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE CONDITIONING AGAIN YOU WANT TO DO THIS BEFORE YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON BECAUSE IF YOU TEST IT AFTER YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON AND SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER BACK OFF WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT NOW I KNOW ON SOME SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CONTACTOR AND THE CAPACITOR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE FAN OFF AND SOME OTHER COMPONENTS SO IN THAT CASE IF YOUR SYSTEM IS SET UP THAT WAY YOU'LL NEED TO PUT THOSE ITEMS BACK ON BEFORE TESTING BECAUSE IF THE FAN IS NOT SECURED AND YOU SWITCH IT ON THE FAM MAY DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE UNIT AND ALSO BE A HAZARD TO ANYBODY THAT WOULD BE STANDING NEARBY IF IT WERE TO COME APART FROM THE SYSTEM ONCE YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE THEN YOU CAN PUT THE PANEL AND SCREWS BACK IN PLACE AND THAT WILL BE IT ALSO WHILE YOU'RE AT IT YOU CAN CHECK THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CONDITION COAL SUCH AS THE LINES THAT RUN IN AND OUT AS WELL AS THE WIRING THAT GOES IN AND OUT TO THAT UNIT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO DO THAT SINCE YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO DO REPAIRS ON THAT TO LOOK IT OVER AS WELL AND I'VE BEEN MENTIONING IT EARLIER IN THE VIDEO BUT IF YOU HAVE BUGS OR ANYTHING INSIDE THE PLACE WHERE THE CONTACTOR AND CAPACITOR ARE TRY TO CLEAN THOSE OUT THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THOSE ARE THE CULPRITS FOR YOUR CAPACITOR OR CONTACTOR TO STOP WORKING THEY SOMETIMES WILL CRAWL IN THERE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE CAPACITOR THEY ACTUALLY CRAWL INSIDE OF THE CAPACITOR AND WHEN THE CAPACITOR GOES TO SWITCH ON IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SWITCH ON BECAUSE THAT BUG MIGHT BE BLOCKING THE MECHANICAL PORTIONS OF THAT FROM MOVING AND SIMILAR FOR THE CAPACITOR IF THERE'S A BUG OR SOME KIND OF ANIMAL IN THERE AND IT'S TOUCHING THE YOU KNOW TWO MORE POINTS OF THE CAPACITOR AND THAT CAPACITOR SWITCHES ON IT CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE THAT CAPACITOR TO SHORT OUT BECAUSE THAT OTHER ANIMAL IS ACTUALLY GIVEN A PATH BETWEEN TWO OF THE TOOL BOARD THE TERMINALS ON THE CAPACITOR SO AGAIN CLEANING OUT THE BUGS COBWEBS ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE ALSO TAKE NOTE IF THERE ARE ANY CHEWED WIRES BECAUSE IF THERE SHOOT WIRES THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE A RAT OR RODENT PROBLEM AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL HOPEFULLY YOU'VE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT AND ARE ABLE TO APPLY THIS IN THE FUTURE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTACTOR OR RELAY PLEASE HIT ME UP AND DROP A COMMENT IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW ALSO PLEASE CHECK OUT ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER AT

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on fellow engineers this is Kenny and thanks for checking out the Almost Engineer Channel and in this video I'm going to talk about a contactor this thing right here and how it works stay tuned Music alright so this is the contactor that I took off of my HVAC unit and this is the old one so I just wanted to talk about what a contactor is and what it does and how it works and so there are some elements on here that are not exactly right with a modern contactor this one is probably original to the HVAC unit that I have so there are some differences that I notice between the new one and the old one alright folks so I got my new contactor which is this one over here and my old contactor which is this one here for the most part they are pretty much the same the screw on this one actually I had to screw it all the way out to get the lead out of there so but there are some significant differences that I'm noticing so on the top of this one actually you stick the wire in whereas this one had a clamp that you put a connector on it and then you put that connector around the screw head so the top is essentially like the bottom now where you stick the whole wire in and then you screw to clamp it down all the way also the same number of pins here looks to be there's eight on the bottom and there's eight on the top here I only had I believe it was two wires here and this one also is enclosed so as you can see you can see the coil on this one both sides so but you can on this one and the reason being is somebody actually took the counts that hey bugs can actually get into this thing and cause problems so what they do now is they actually seal it up entirely so all this mechanical stuff like this right here is not exposed to the elements however you can take these two screws off and this play to come up and then it will look just like this inside underneath this cover here so that's the difference between the new contactor and the old contactor and so with this particular contactor unit so we'll start off with the label of course and here you'll see is rated for 25 amps and it's also a 24 volt coil and so the contactor that I put on is actually rated for 30 amps but it's also 24 volts and so what the amperage has to do is that it has a maximum capacity you know you see it as 25 so if you try to push 30 through it more likely you'll have a problem and I think that kind of helped in some cases the failure of this one and so if you see right here where this screw is you'll see this plastic here is actually burned and cracked it actually broke off what happened there was it looks like the wire on it actually broke burned some kind of way I don't know if something got into it and caused it to short out or what the case was but this is the connector that was on it after the fact from the wire way it burned off at so and as you see this screw is actually brown so I don't know if that is the indicator of the problem that was going on with it because it should not have been brown it should be fight the rest of these you know silver we're not so just a walk overview of everything so on the bottom here have pins you can have these push connectors that go on these pins here at the bottom then you also have these two terminal screws and so you can stick the wire in this gap here tighten the screw down same thing on this side and then on the top it's a different setup because they actually use these connectors that go over the screw and then you tighten screw down on the connector instead of sticking the wire directly in so that's that side and this is what is known as a single pole breaker and there's also a thing called a double pole breaker so the pole is the thing that actually moves so this one here is not seized up it does move but it only has one pole which is this side so this right side here as you see there's a metal bar that goes from top to bottom that means this side is always hot this side is the side that switches so we turn on the AC U and it this goes in and it connects the bottom which is where the power comes in that to the top which is where it goes out to the compressor and the fan on the condenser unit and completes the circuit so sue Evans so fan is running but there's no I don't hear the compressor running too and so that's how that works now how does this move back and forth well on this side and on this side you have these two connectors as well these since this is a 24 volt coil these connect to the 24 volt wires that come from the inner handler that is on the building interior so when there is a call for cooling the thermostat connects the wires inside of it and that signal goes to the air handler the air handler triggers that same since that signal out to the condenser through one side and then back out the other therefore you complete the circuit and when you complete the circuit on here this pushes in and completes the 240 circuit so if you ever heard me discuss about relays before this is essentially the same concept as a relay you have a voltage of one type in this case would be in 24 volts controlling a voltage of a higher type which in this case is 240 volts that's 120 on the Left 120 on the right which equals 240 now this one may or may not say it I do not believe it does but it is designed for 240 but it doesn't say it the unit itself says 240 the actual conditioner unit says 240 on it so and then once you remove the 24 volts so the thermostat says hey I've reached the set temperature shut off so that means the thermostat disconnects the connection between the air handler and it and so as a result that same connection is also removed so the incoming 24 volts is removed from here and thus there's nothing on this side to go back so this connector in the middle here will spring up and there is a spring underneath it as you can kind of see right there there's a spring there and so that comes back up to disconnect the connector connection between the top of the bottom so that covers how a contactor works hopefully you've learned a little bit and are able to apply this in the future if you have any questions about the contactor or relay please hit me up and drop a comment in the comment section below also please check out me on social media on Instagram and Twitter at almost Engr and check out my website the

These trees are called Hackberry Trees. In 2017, I had one split. It the split portion of the tree fell over into my yard. In 2019, there was another Hackberry Tree that split. This time it split over into the neighbor's yard. I have also had branches randomly break off and split from other Hackberry Trees.</p> <p>The reason that I wanted to cut the trees was because:</p> <ol> <li>they block a lot of the southern and western sunlight from reaching the garden during the summer time.</li> <li>wanted to reduce the chance of having another tree splitting and landing in the neighbors yard.</li> <li>there were two many trees along the property line. Thus wanted to thin them out as some of them had their growth stunted by other trees.</li> </ol> <p>In total, I cut two trees down. One was about 25 feet (7.62 meters) tall, the other about 20 feet (6.096 meters) tall. After cutting them down into managable pieces, they will be placed on the firewood stand that I built to dry and eventually be burned in the firepit.</p> <p>In the later summer of 2020, I cut down 3 Hackberry Trees.

The reason being is that the meeting point for the branches have a tendency to develop into a bowl shape instead of like the peak of a roof. This bowl shape, holds water and over time the water rots out the branch. Once enough rot has formed, the weight of the branch causes the branch to break or, in my case, the tree to split in half do to the weight of the branches.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.02.09-starting-the-garden-for-spring/#collard-and-mustard-greens","title":"Collard and Mustard Greens","text":"<p>I still have collard greens in the garden.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on fellow engineers today i actually have a handy job and so i'm going to be showing you uh some of the details related to that job i have my tools already loaded up and about head to head out this particular job is for a tv mounting this tv mounting i'm not going to actually do video of me actually installing that inside the customer's house because i don't like to do that usually i'll just take pictures so i'll discuss like the steps i do as i'm mounting it with the pictures that i'll show you coming up all right i have pulled up to the customer's house so the next part of the process is i check in on the handy app to let the handy though as well as the customer know that i have arrived at their location all right so what we have here is a tv install this is the tv that the customer wanted to install he has like a workout space if you will a workout room and uh this is a tcl i believe it is as you see here it is a 32 inch smart cv and he wanted it mount on the wall that way when he works out you know you can turn it on move it away from the wall do what you got to do then when you're done turn it off so be it uh also with this tv he provided the on the tv mount as you see from this is the instruction manual it is a 32 to 47 inch mount but is a single mount so it literally mounts to a single stud on the wall and it's also a mount that articulates so it can be moved in and out and the tv you know twist turned rather you know left or right to position it where it needs to be positioned all right the first step in this was to you had to it came with a template the mount that is and you had to drill three holes on the wall to mount the three bolts that would eventually come in that's in a future step uh the what i did i had to use my stud finder to locate where the stud was on the wall and so once i found that stud i like i said drill the holes there because this room is at a a rather different angle this wall that is being mounted to is a full wall i believe this wall was eight no excuse me maybe nine or ten feet but on the other side of where this wall is is actually a knee wall so if you're not familiar knee walls are usually a short vertical wall three to four feet high and then the remaining height of that wall is a sloped angle which is the back side of the roof and so positioning it where it was and trying to get it in between you know essentially a angle like this where you have the vertical wall on this side and then the slope group on this side and to get it high enough so that if the tv is out you can walk underneath it and not hit your head but also not too high that it bumps the wall over here on the the sloped wall or sloped ceiling if you will so that was a little bit of challenge i measured it probably about three or four times and even when i measured it though several times i wasn't 100 sure that i actually got it in the right spot but i managed to do so so after that uh the three holes are in the wall the next step is to mount the bracket onto the back of the tv and so this also came in the bracket that is came with the tv mount and also these four screws here and depending on this tv because it accepts so many sizes you see there are multiple holes here and it actually has some extension arms that came in the kit that allow you to attach for even bigger tvs but because this is the smallest size that this mount will accommodate i didn't need all of that extra hardware so i was able to use the four screws on the actual plate itself alright the next part i mounted the mount to the wall and as you see those three holes that i drilled earlier are where the three bolts are at and pay attention because some mounts do have like arrows of how those mounts are supposed to be installed and as you see here this mount actually has a up arrow because this is supposed to be in the up direction because the actual where the the back plate on the tv connects to this mount is designed to only work one way so if you install it upside down the tv won't stay on so pay attention pay attention pay attention oftentimes they the manual will also mention whether the mount should be a right side up or upside down or if it if you can even install it upside down but like i say pay attention now if you notice this kind of this hole here is not straight centered into the opening and the reason being is because well i put the level onto the side of the mount itself because sometimes you may not drill exactly center into the stud that happens you know a little bit of user error in there sometimes and it could also be the fault of stud finder because all stuff finders are not a hundred percent accurate all the time that being said though this one is like i said it's not square center in here but the mount itself was vertical you know 100 level because i put the level on it once i got the top bolt in then i put the level on it and moved it over as it needed to be so that it remained level and then secure the bolt in place all right now here's a different angle for the mounts the top and bottom bolts have covers that go over there that way you don't see them when the tv is moved away from the wall the middle one doesn't because i think the way they designed it they would think hey if you're going to put this tv on the wall that middle mount is not i mean that middle screw is not as significant to be seen so there was no cover for that one you can also see that i've mounted the tv here and up here is two screws that actually secure the mounting plate which is this right here to the mount itself and the top half doesn't even actually have bolts in it it just has this kind of like a hook like this and so the arm just sits on top of that and so that's how the top of it is held in and then as i mentioned the bottom part is held in with these two screws here and here is the final a different view of the final installation so as you see and here there is this angle uh slope of the ceiling as well as over here but it does fit in the space and it can be moved you know at any angle and here's a different angle of that room as you see again this is the this is the back side of the roof or the ceiling for this room because it does have knee walls so it's very of a very tight space i didn't run the cables down to the outlet the customer stated that he has some additional cables that he wanted to run and he wanted to get the they have this uh what they call like a wire channel and he wanted to get that and install that but he said he would do that himself so i left the plug off of there because there is no plug up here in this area the plug was uh directly below where this went so if it wasn't on this stud it may have been on the next stud over so he probably would have had to get like a surge protector or an extension cord of some sort to be able to run that distance in addition to being able to uh have enough slack in here so that he can move it in and out as need be when he's in the room and with that the tv install is completed as you saw the installation was in a fairly tight space but the customer is happy where it was placed because that is where he wanted it to be so i've now checked out the handy app and that completes this job so with this job in particular it was booked for two hours but i was able to finish it in roughly 45 minutes or so so when that happens handy still pays you for the full two hours because that is what the customer booked so you know the faster you work and you know of course if you book if you do it faster and get it right then you're hourly pay rate if you will essentially goes up so for that particular install i got i think it was paying 50 for the two hour period so because i did it faster than maybe i got 50 an hour so not bad for you know hours worth of work not including the drive time to and from the customer's house so that wraps it up for this video if you have any

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what is going on fellow engineers this here is part of my hallway uh as you see here i have the doorbell box up here and you know i have white trim as you see over here on the right hand side and down here at the baseboards and the door but this doorbell box has this ugly tarnished yellow color so this video i'm going to show you how to paint this box to make it blend in with the rest of the environment Music so welcome to the channel if this is your first time checking out videos here just know i do videos every week one on tuesday for technology and videos on saturday for diy and handyman projects so if either of those topics interest you please be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button down below so this is my doorbell box um you know pretty basic uh my house was built in the late 70s so you know this has probably been up here since the house was built and i don't like this tan off-white color especially you know since i'm trying to like modernize things so the box just comes off fairly easy like literally you just pull it off it has these locking tabs in here like right there and right there that connect here and here and then there's two on the top there and so that's it so the next part is to go ahead and get this painted the next step is to get a some sandpaper or i have this on a sanding block and as you see it doesn't quite fit but that's what it is so sandpaper and what you want to do is rough up the surface if you don't have sandpaper you can also use some steel wool or copper wool it may take a little bit more effort to get this to work like sandpaper but it can still do the job and basic the concept that you want to go for is to scratch up the surface because when you go to paint this plastic surface you want the paint to stick to it therefore use sandpaper steel wool copper wool something abrasive that'll scratch up the surface all you're trying to do is to rough up the surface so that it's not shiny you know normally plastic has a shine to it so you want to try to remove that shine and that will allow the paint to stick and i'm only going to do the outside of the box because nobody's going to see the inside of the box unless they take the box off the wall once you have sanded the surface sufficiently just wipe off that excess dust i am using a tack cloth but if you don't have one of those you know if you know something similar paper towel with like alcohol on it or something of that nature can also do the same job then you want to get as you want to get all the dust off of here otherwise that dust will inhibit the paint from sticking to the surface all right now that that is done next step is to paint i just have white paint so that it can match the rest of the trim this paint has a paint and primer and it's designed for indoor and outdoors but obviously i'm using the indoor so it doesn't matter you don't necessarily need to have indoor and outdoor paint this just so happens to be able to do both um and depending on your box you may not even need the paint and primer you probably just need the paint but because paint and primer wasn't that much more expensive than just paint i got the paint and primer as always shake your spray paint can up before you use it and shake it while you're using it that's what the instructions say so just follow the instructions when it comes to applying this paint nothing special to it depending on the color change that you're trying to do like you're trying to go from like a black to a white you may have to do more than one or two coats to get that black to actually be white this should not be take too many more coats maybe two probably three and that's it so like i said check your paint and start applying it and make sure you're doing this i'm in my garage with the door open but you can also do this outside you don't want to do this indoors entirely because the fumes from the paint are they can cause you know you to become light-headed and all the other things so again open area outside or in a open garage and when you're spraying walk around and spray all of the angles don't try to do this or anything of that nature and the reason i say don't do it that way is because sometimes you'll spray but because you can't see what you're spraying you will miss part or of what you're trying to spray so just walk around it now even with this one coat on here as you can tell it's already made a difference in the appearance of it what i'm gonna do is let this dry according to the instructions on the can and then put another coat on top of here uh the kind of because i can see a little bit of the tan in here um that was originally part of the you know that's part of the original surface so i'm put another coat on top of that and then we'll go back and reinstall it and let you see the final product the doorbell box has now been reinstalled as you see it is white like some of the other items on the wall here and in my opinion i think it was better painted white than it did with that off-white tan looking color so if you think it looks better now than it did before drop a comment down below share your feedback

(Unedited)","text":"<p>for people like me that like to do their own stuff you know handiwork and love diy this is one diy project that i wouldn't recommend for a lot of people this yes that's right that is a rat it's been going in and out of my attic for probably the last week and i set up a trap about a year and a half to maybe two years ago and the trap was still set and well let's just say said rat succumbed to its injuries um and as you can see it stuck his head in there and that head got gone like the wind [Music] what's going on fellow engineers thank you for checking out this video if this is your first time to the channel please be sure to consider to subscribe into the channel each week i have videos that talk about how to do technology or how to do diy projects so if you have any interest in that please be sure to subscribe this video as you saw in the opener i'm going to talk about the trex rat trap i actually have two traps so the one in this picture that i'm going to show is actually the tracks tricks rat trap and then the one that i actually have here is the tomcat rat snap trap they are both similar in nature because they both have are plastic and they have these teeth on so anything that gets caught in there is not going because the teeth as you see they interlock kind of like the teeth of an alligator so anything that gets in there like i said it gets caught so the particular rat that was in the attic it had been going in and out for about a week or two in the attic i do know that there are some opening holes and whatnot in the roof line and in some places in the fascia the previous homeowners they at one point while they lived here there were squirrels in the attic and there is plenty of evidence of squirrels being in the attic so it's kind of not surprising that a rat has managed to be able to get in the attic as well and so what i was able to do i set this trap in the attic like i said about a year two years prior to this taking place and the trap was actually still set and thus caught the rat i don't remember if i actually put bait in the trap or not um i'm thinking i probably did and that may have attracted it to it uh but yeah i'm kind of surprised myself that i was able to get this done you know in this way so to talk about this trap a little bit more like i mentioned it does have teeth on it this trap is made out of entire plastic like the whole construction with the exception of the spring that you may be able to see inside of there uh it's entirely plastic this spring and the retaining pin are the only parts on here that are metal so in terms of durability it it's pretty high up you can set it with one hand and the design of it allows you to set it and you don't end up snapping your fingers trying to set it you know most of those wood traps with the metal bar on them you have to hold the base of it the wooden part down and then you move the metal bar and then you have to put the trigger over and it requires both hands and if you're not careful when you're trying to set it you'll snap your finger under there and the smaller traps probably won't hurt if you snap your finger but the bigger ones that are probably the size of this trap that are with that metal bar will probably hurt your finger and uh in some cases you may actually get injured in the process um but this one it allows you to like i say set one hand all you gotta do is the back end of it just push down to the catches and it's set just that simple um so no snapping your fingers or anything of that nature the trigger and this particular trap is this black piece right here whoa good thing i have my thumb back there but this piece right here you press down and it releases and it snaps down and if you notice there's a thing in the middle here that thing in the middle is actually where your bait goes and so you can put peanut butter uh i think they suggested peanut butter or maybe like some fruit like raisins or something like that nature but it actually unscrews you just twist it out and it comes out of there at the bottom and then um you put whatever you want to in there as far as bait goes then you put it back in twist it in on the bottom right here and it's ready to go and so um this i i recommend this trap having that it actually stayed and caught a rat uh reasons being and i recommend it one it was set for over a year um most traps they won't stay set for that long sometimes because of the trigger is a little bit too sensitive so like you know a couple specks of dust land on it and it'll snap on its own um other traps you know they just through the expansion and traction of the springs through the heat and so forth they snap that way but this one did not so i was kind of surprised by that and i'm glad it actually did work the second reason that i would recommend this particular trap is because of the mechanism of how it keeps rats the teeth on here will grab and whatever it grabs is going to hold because of that teeth those wooden wraps with the metal bar there are stories of where the trap snapped and the rat because the trap was undersized for the animal that was trying to be captured um the the rat was actually just able to slide back out even though it hit him it didn't hit him in the right way where uh like it didn't hit him across the head it like hit like behind the head probably towards the back and so it was able to take that hit and then just slide his way out by using his legs to push on the wooden piece and slide out that those teeth on here you can push on here as hard as you want to but because those teeth actually kind of bite in and as you see the teeth are interlocking it doesn't let go this particular rat when it snapped now mind you i was asleep when it when it all happened and i kind of was freaked out in the middle of the night um but when it happened uh all i heard i woke up to like a just a beating like and it's like in the world is going on and so what i actually figured out and put two and two together with was that as you see this spot here doesn't have a lot of insulation on it and so i think what happened was the rat found the trap and stuck his head in there and when it snapped it tried to do like a barrel roll type deal to get out of the trap but because the rat you know that trap was not gonna let it go it it didn't let go and it just rolled and rolled the road and so the banging noise was the trap knocking on the back side of the draw wall that you see in this picture here so um yeah like i say you can fight it all you want to uh but or these the rats can fight it all they want to was not get out at all and so and i guess one of the main things about it is uh even when it snapped it didn't it didn't instantly kill the rat uh based on how i was able to see how it snapped on the head but it did contain a head and i really actually snapped the rat on his head it didn't even grab like the neck and so uh but because it grabbed the head and it wasn't able to go anywhere and then the hot temperatures that are in a typical attic um you know basically the rat suffocated uh from the hot temperatures if it didn't suffocate from the hot temperatures uh it suffocated from this pretty much cutting off the probably breeding that nature um the third reason i would recommend this particular trap is you actually have to look inside of the trap so if you see up here and i don't want to get a pen i don't want this to accidentally snap but if you see right in better yet i here get one you can actually see but if you see right in here there's a little spike kind of difficult to see there's a spike right here and so this spike actually lines up with the hole there you go this spike lines up with the hole where the bait goes in the trap and so what happens is if the when the trap snaps if the rat has its head in that place and the trap snaps the rat gets stabbed in the head so it's like instant death um when it happened in this particular scenario uh looking at the aftermath of it the head was slightly off of the opening so i'm thinking he probably was kind of skeptic at first maybe he managed to stick his head in i'm not fully sure but in either scenario the head was not square so he didn't die um but you know some traps do have that but this trap does have that set up so that your head in there die immediately um but it has to be in the right spot so that's kind of like the downside to it now to talk about some of the cons of this particular trap it is a little bit more expensive than the typical basic rat trap that has the metal base i mean excuse me the wooden base with the metal bars on it um those traps in my area run for about a dollar to a dollar and fifty us dollars that is and this particular trap runs from about seven to eight bucks us dollars so fairly more expensive but this trap is reusable it's designed to be reusable in part it is made out of plastic instead of like the cheaper wood and metal ones that you would get um and to be honest with you i would i i would since i have caught this rat and i do have two of these style of traps i'm going to actually go ahead and set these back in the attic uh again and who knows something else may manage to get up there but i'd rather have the traps up there and they never catch anything than to have critters running around and there's nothing that can catch them um so i know i i think this is a great investment in my opinion if you have any questions or comments you know or negative points that you bought this trap and didn't like about it feel free in the comments feel free to share those in the comments below um i'm willing to discuss that with you and any other questions that you may have so that will then wrap things up for this video i ask you to please give this video a thumbs up and also leave a comment have any questions drop those below and don't forget to subscribe so until

After doing some research, I did find that some just create an outline for their speeches. Thus I took the outline approach for my first speech. When doing an outline, you are not writing every single word out. Instead, you are writing the main points that you want to make while doing your speech. It also allows you to adjust as need be by skipping over some of the points in case you run short on time.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.05.05-toastmasters-ice-breaker-speech/#other-details","title":"Other Details","text":"<p>I titled my speech \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" after the novel.

It took about a week or two for my body to get in the fasting habit. Once it did, did not have to  worry about eating so much.</p> <p>Also part of my fasting strategy is to not eat anything after 8 PM (20:00). Reason being is that your food needs time to digest. When you eat and then go to bed, you have a greater chance of experiencing heartburn or acid reflux because your body is processing food in a position (horizontally) that it is not normally used to doing.

Instead of going for the snack cakes, ice cream, or other sugar loaded food, try eating some fruit. Not the fruit cups that are loaded with syrup, but actual fruit like an apple or orange. The reason that I suggest to eat the actual fruit instead of snack cakes is because the fruit has other vitamins, minerals, and in some cases fiber that your body really needs.

Then when I am ready to publish the post,  I create and merge a pull request on my  blog's repository and the CI/CD process takes care of generating the files and pushing them to the website.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on good people this saturday project is putting together a office chair i uh you know due to the coronavirus and working from home the previous office chair that i had got worn out and given the age of the chair uh i figured all right it's time to go ahead and get a new one what should i get so i'm gonna share with you what i got as well as the assembly of said chair Music all right so this is the office chair that i ended up purchasing i got it off that uh amazon i'll just be honest uh this chair is the is an office exec executive office chair now i know a lot of people like why didn't you get a gaming chair well i looked into the gaming chairs and the thing about the gaming chairs that i saw is they did not have enough padding they are while they are cheap and functional and they look cool they do not necessarily support you for sitting for extended periods of time and looking at the reviews and some of the commentary that other people that have said that um yeah i'm glad i didn't buy those gaming chairs i actually had a cousin that bought one of those gaming chairs and so when we did a zoom meeting for thanksgiving with our family members um you know i saw him in one of the chairs that he got off of the gaming chairs that he got off amazon and so i asked him about it i was like hey how you feel about that chair that you sitting in and yeah pretty much his consensus was he hates it and so uh he mentioned a lot of what i saw which is is not as comfortable and that it um you know he kind of wished that he got something a little bit better so um and as you see i am sitting in the chair that i am talking about so uh i'm not making this up i actually do use what i'm talking about so this particular chair uh it is very comfortable it does have a weight capacity of 400 pounds now obviously you can tell and you've seen me in other videos that i'm nowhere near close to 400 pounds but i wanted a chair that was uh sturdy enough um you know and not just like borderline uh at the limits because you know things happen right you know i could sit in the chair and then pick up i don't know a heavy book or something and bam the chair breaks that's not that's not a situation that i want to be in um so uh i chose to share like i say weight capacity uh the legs on this chair are metal not plastic like you would get with a lot of those gaming chairs that you see on amazon they usually have plastic wheels with a plastic legs and the failure point on those chairs are usually the legs because that's where your weight capacity comes in at um and also the weight capacity on those chairs from what i was able to see was right around 200 to maybe 225 now i'm like 185 so 200 is not that far of a stretch for me like if i eat a big meal i could probably get close to 200. so um i was kind of wanting something with a little bit more weight capacity and so this chair came up as one of those options um also as i mentioned the padding on this chair this padding on this chair is rather thick it's very comfortable like i sit here and a lot of times you know i'm working from home because of the virus but then also after i get done working from home then i continue to sit here and work on videos like this or i work on coding projects that i have so something else and you know 10 12 even in some cases 14 hours in this chair and i don't feel sore or anything of that nature one other thing i wanted to point out is for me so i'm six feet tall and so the back of the chair is while it's right at the bottom of my head i wanted something that did have support for my upper back um because the chair that i have at my office like work office uh it does have full body support up here and it actually has even a headrest and so uh this one doesn't have a headrest unfortunately and i kind of wish it did but i'm okay with it at least supporting my shoulders and upper back because that's where a lot of your attention um that in your lower back is where your tension comes in when you're sitting for extended periods of time so i'm going to get into this assembly so this is obviously the box that it came in 50 pounds a pretty big box um i want to say maybe two feet by three feet uh as you see it says 50 pounds well excuse me 56 pounds is the gross weight the chair itself is 50 pounds so a very sturdy chair um so here are the instructions um everything that comes in here not many parts as you may think it may have uh like i said it was a lot of it was already pre-assembled so the mechanical portions of like the seat that raises and lowers the chair itself is already assembled in one piece you just have to attach it to the base of the chair it has these set of bolts um and then it comes with a tool to put everything together so literally i did not have to go get any tools um the tool came with it all right so i have in this photo taking the base out of the box as i mentioned the base is made out of metal and all you gotta do to put the wheels in there are holes in the base and you just slide them in and they lock in on their own and then here is the pack of bolts and the tool as well as the plastic caps that come with it uh just follow the instructions on how to assemble it so this is the mechanical portion of the chair so this is what controls the up and down movement as well as the rock back functionality usually i don't lock the chair uh from rocking back unlike some chairs this chair does not have the functionality where you can lock it in like various degrees you either lock it straight up or you don't lock it at all so that's kind of a sucky part like if you like to slightly recline back and lock your chair this chair won't do that like i can i'm leaning back now as you see but it's still going to move but once i sit up i don't know if you can hear that on camera but that's that click that you just probably heard was the chair actually locking in the upright position so now it won't go back and then i can unlock it and i will go back and then the other handle over here is for the height adjustment i keep this chair at the highest level that is sitting like i mentioned i'm six feet tall so my legs are literally angled straight across in this position i wanted a chair that was a little bit higher um but you know given the value and so forth this was the kind of the best of the deal in terms of chair height and comfort level all right and here's another angle it clearly marks where the front is and so you see front here as well as the front on the mounting portion so you make sure those are both pointing in the same direction i did put the arms on um it's a step in here that mentions about putting the arms on you do have to screw them on on the side there i had some difficulties getting the Music back of the chair connected to the arms because the back of the chair actually connects to the arms it does not connect to the seat of this chair so that's how that stays up but i was able to i had to loosen some of the other screws in on the chair to be able to get the back to properly align with one of the screws that had some difficulties with and then once i did that then everything was able to be tightened up as far as the back of the chair and the armrests are concerned so i am happy with it i um i believe i paid about 250 for this chair um i give or take maybe 25 on that and so uh this sheriff so far i've been using it um for about three months now and it's held up pretty well um one other thing i want to know is so a lot of those gaming chairs that i was looking at uh they have like faux leather or like polyester or some other non-breathing type material that they are made of this has a it's not full leather is i think it may be like a something similar to leather so it's a little bit durable but not exactly the gaming chair quality that you would think um you know it's not the gaming chair fabric that you would want on this type of chair and so um but it does work i know somebody else that i had a customer that had a similar chair to this this one uh the one that they had though it was it was the same brand but it was not as executive level if you will of a chair it has the same functionality it had the same assembly instructions too but their chair actually had a uh the back of the chair vibrated and you basically plugged in your laptop to the chair and the chair got the power to run the massager from the laptop very interesting concept um but you know i think it was a pretty cool chair i'm not sure how much they paid for it but i know that that's how that chair was designed so um yeah there's that if you have any questions about this feel free to drop a comment down below i'll be glad to answer anything to the best of my ability regarding the assembly of the chair or the review of this chair and how it has played out thus far um or in the future if you have any excuse me if you

Airport","text":""},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.11-maximize-your-layover/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Normally when I fly, I try to find a nonstop flight. Why? Because I do not want to sit around in an airport looking at other people and waiting for the plane to show up. Besides, when you do not have a layover, you get your destination quicker and are less likely to buy overpriced food and drinks at the airport.</p> <p>In May 2021, I traveled to Seattle. With COVID-19 practically dominating 2020 and nobody going anywhere, it was time to get out and explore, safely of course. Given that I was flying across to the other side of the country, there was only 1 non-stop flight that was available and it was at the worse time to fly... 6AM going to the destination and like 11PM coming from the destination. Thus the only choice was to get a flight with a layover in it.</p> <p>In the past, if I had to do a layover, then I would try to find the shortest one possible. I had a work flight in 2013 that had a 30 minute layover, which was great! However, the only problem was that the arriving plane parked at Terminal A and the departing plane was at Terminal E. Oh... and this was at the Charlotte Airport (CLT) for those who have been there. Never would do a layover that close again unless I  knew that the gates were close to each other.</p> <p>This time, I picked a layover that seemed reasonable from the options presented. Below I account what I was able to do during the layover just to give you an idea of what you can do to maximize your trip in the future.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.11-maximize-your-layover/#preparation","title":"Preparation","text":""},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.11-maximize-your-layover/#research-what-you-can-do-before-you-land","title":"Research What You Can Do Before You Land","text":"<p>Do not wait until you get off your flight in order to look up things to do. Do this ahead of time. Reason  being is that you will waste your layover time trying to find something to do when you could be using  that time to reserve transportation to get you to the attractions or restaurants that you want to check out.</p> <p>Not to mention, if you are using a car sharing service (e.g. Uber or Lyft), it may take a moment to find  the pickup points for these services as the airports have control on where these drivers can pick you up at.

Downtown Denver, where most of the popular attractions are, was at least 25 minutes away on this clear sunny day. From the airport, you can see the Rocky Mountains and the tallest of Downtown buildings from the airport.</p> <p>Because the attractions were so far away, used the time to go to  Renegado Tacos and Margaritas on Tower  Rd. Talking with the Uber Driver, he had never heard of the place. Once we arrived,  we saw that the restaurant appeared to be fairly new as the neighboring building still had some work that needed  to be completed on it and construction vehicles could be seen in the distance working on nearby plot of land. </p> <p>Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the food that I had, but it was good. I will say that they  seemed limited in the sauces that they had that you would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant.</p> <p>After leaving the restaurant, went back to the airport as there was only about 1 hour left before the  connecting flight was to leave for Seattle (SEA).

Near the airport was a place called  Masters Pancake House.  Like with the last layover, checked with the Uber driver to see if he was familiar with the restaurant,  and he was not. While the name does not indicate it, the restaurant was ran by Hispanics. Thus the food was a variety of American  Breakfast with a Hispanic twist. In my opinion, the food was large size portions for the price. Like the  omelet that I had must have been made from at least 4-5 eggs.</p> <p>Because there was still plenty of time, decided to use it. The next stop was to check out The Bean,  also known as the  Cloud Gate.  While going to and leaving the Cloud Gate, I got to see some of the major attractions in Chicago like the  Willis Tower(formerly the Sears Tower),  Soldier Field, and  Lake Michigan as we rode down South Lake Shore Drive. Since the  Crown Fountain was right next to the Cloud Gate, visited it as well. </p> <p>Still had some time left, but given the distance that I was from the airport and  to factor in the traffic, figured that it was time to head back. That proved to be a wise decision.  After arriving at the airport, it took approximately 45 minutes (if not longer)  to get through security. I am not sure why  they were so slow with getting people though the checkpoint. By the time we reached the gate, they were  starting to board the plane and have people line up. Midway (MDW) has to do better about getting people  efficiently though the checkpoint.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.06.11-maximize-your-layover/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Taking a trip to one destination, can be more valuable if you are able to get in additional cities  and sights in during the layover.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on good people today's video i'm going to be talking about the assembly for a pro pt 600 power tower it is a workout machine um that i had to assemble for a customer here we go Music all right this particular machine i like i said i had to go and assemble it for a customer i don't have the specifics of like how long they how much it cost or anything of that nature but i did once i started opening the packaging and following the assembly instructions it did show a reference to dick's sporting goods so if you are interested in that you probably can get that from dick's sporting goods and so this is the box i did not take as many pictures as i normally do when i do these type of videos um that's just something a mistake on my end uh but this is the finalized machine you know once it is assembled and so it has multiple workout uh that multiple workouts that you can do on here and so this uh i guess cushion here actually it goes here on the back but it can also go down here on the bottom as you see there's this support here and support here so you can take it off and then put it down there and then use it as a knee pad of sorts to do other workouts on the machine and so uh the machine for this uh for as large as it is the assembly was relatively easy to do i was able to complete everything in about an hour uh majority of the bolts are the same so it has a pretty much every bolt that you see here with the exception of probably about six maybe eight of them are exactly the same so it's very difficult to make a mistake when trying to assemble this because of the fact there's so there's a lot of the same parts that go on the majority of the machine and for these bolts that are here is pretty much a bolt you put a washer on one end you slide it through wherever it's supposed to go then you put a washer on the other end and then you put a nut on the end of that bolt and all the nuts on here are locking nuts so that they do not back out easy as you are doing the workouts or whatever the case um i did do a couple of reps on it and it was able to hold me you know fine the maximum capacity according to the assembly instructions is 300 pounds for this particular machine the bars here the pull-up bars where you can do your i believe you do your dips these actually do come out this orange ball here and there's one on the other side you pull these out and then these drop down so that you have more space to do your pull-ups which is up here as i mentioned you can move this from this position down to the bottom here and then you also have like things where you can do like leg curls and so forth so it's useful um i actually have considered getting one of these myself just to be able to do some body weight workouts but it was fairly easy to assemble like i say in and out in about an hour i did have to use my hammer drill i probably could have gotten away with using like a socket wrench or um just a regular wrench to tighten up the nuts and bolts but given that those lock those lock washers on on there pretty strongly and so pretty much every time i went to go and tighten the bolts on here the hammer function like immediately almost kicked in uh just to put the nut on the bolt so uh i think it's pretty sturdy on here i did take care to make sure that those were not too tight that actually that the hammer drill didn't tighten so tight that actually started bending the metal but the metal uh i think i may have over drilled it just a little bit on some of them but the metal did not flex after maybe a little bit over tightening those um the only other i guess concern about this is so when you're putting this together the instructions do have like written steps because i'm so used to putting the you know furniture and other assemblies together without actually reading the written steps i was able to do it strictly just off the photos the diagrams on there are pretty clear on how you're supposed to assemble it and what bolt goes where the only thing i will say is i will add to that that the instructions also mentioned that you are supposed to assemble everything hand tighten only in the beginning and that's what i did so i got all the bolts in and hand tighten them so that they didn't you know the whole thing didn't fall back apart as i was still assembling assembling it and then once i got the whole assembly together then i started on the side over here starting and making my way from one bolt all the way around and then came back on the other side and did the same thing and everything worked out fine the rubber feet that you see here was already attached to the uh metal supports here so i didn't even have to do that part it was literally just put in all the bolts so screw i had i did have to secure these uh armrest pads on the uh horizontal supports here and this back pad to this cross plate here um but other than that everything else was straightforward didn't have to paint or anything of that nature so this is just a walkthrough of how you know easy was to assemble this fairly straightforward if you have any questions about this particular product

Buddy enjoys going to the park mostly because he enjoys being outside (weather permitting) and not so much for the socialization of other dogs.</p> <p>For the human aspect of being at the dog park, it's similar to how parents talk about their kids when at the playground. My dog has this habit. My dog as this condition. My dog is this years old. You get the idea. One person that was at the park, mentioned that one of her dogs had to have surgery and the surgery was around $5,000 (USD) to perform. I thought to myself that the $150 vet check up every 6 months doesn't sound so bad compared to that.</p> <p>Other dog conversations include where you buy certain things from. For exmaple, Buddy has a harness that goes around his chest. On the back of the harness, there's a handle that can be used to keep the dog next to you if he is trying to run away. While at the park, another dog owner mentioned about getting a harness for his dog.

He's not a fan of this when it happens, so he will stand up on or scratch at the screen door, which I have to yell back for him to stop doing that and I will be back inside shortly.

When nobody is at home, the dog goes in the kennel. He doesn't like to be in the kennel and will often times run to another room or sit down when told to go into the kennel. Ultimately, he is forced to go into the kennel, by either being picked up and placed in the kennel or by being pulled by the collar into the kennel.</p> <p>Sometimes, the dog, like a kid, will not eat his dog food. However, he'll ask (by licking his lips) for human food to eat. This is the equivalent of asking for dessert before eating dinner. No way am I going to allow that to happen. If he doesn't get the human food that he wants, he will stare and look at you with a head turned sideways as if he was saying you know I want some of what you have so share it. When this happens, I advise him to eat his own food first and then he will get human food.

Once the kids came along, things worked smoothly because they had seen who was the friendly parent and who was the restrictive parent. I'll be honest, I'm seeing the same in regards to my fiancee and myself.

Kenny\u2019s better half here :) My now fiance and I dated for a little over a year before he popped the question in January. In May I moved in, and in December, we will be married. There are varying opinions regarding when couples should begin living together. Some might argue that moving in together before marriage jeopardizes the relationship, while others might argue that doing so allows the couple to adjust to one another and iron out the kinks before tying the knot. I don\u2019t think that this is a one-size-fits-all answer; the couple has to do what\u2019s best for them.</p> <p>A little history before I continue: In my adult life I have lived alone, with a roommate, and with my immediate family. There are pros and cons to each, and I bring to my romantic relationship a little from each of those types of living arrangements.</p> <p>But never have I ever lived with someone with whom I was in a relationship. This is definitely different from all the rest! So far, living together has been mostly smooth in my opinion. That being said, the experience has not been without its challenges. The top three adjustments I have had to make with respect to my current living situation relate to schedules, habits, and communication.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2021.07.02-moving-in-with-my-fiance/#schedules","title":"Schedules","text":"<p>I moved in right before another major life transition: full-time employment at a hospital. My schedule has ranged from five 8-hour shifts to three 12-hour shifts. I even take call and had to work the overnight shift once. The days of the week that I work change with the wind. Kenny's schedule, on the other hand, is consistent.</p> <p>The adjustment for me has been coordinating who\u2019s going to do what when and also finding time for ourselves and for one another. I try to do my chores in the mornings since I have been consistently on second shift for a few weeks now. I like my days off to truly be my days off if I can help it. Since COVID, Kenny has been working both from home and at the office. When he is at the office, I find time for me. I let him know my schedule in advance when I have it so that we can plan our time together accordingly. This is different for me, as I am used to a little more consistency. And so is he.</p> <p>When we were still in the boyfriend/girlfriend phase, and I was not yet working my current job, I would go over to his place pretty much the same days each week in the evening time and I worked the weekends. Since I was living with my family at the time, I didn\u2019t have to really worry about household chores or really even about cooking regularly. Those weren\u2019t things I had to fit into my schedule because I had people helping me as I put myself through school. It was nice while it lasted. But as I transition into a new role, I find that it has been helpful to navigate what this sort of thing looks like during the engagement phase. I won\u2019t have as much of the figuring out how I\u2019m going to fit certain tasks and responsibilities into my schedule once we\u2019re married.

At least that\u2019s how I describe them. He hates doing dishes, so he will let them pile up in the sink. I hate washing them too, but I feel like letting them pile up just makes the chore even worse. He does his own laundry, but he\u2019s not so quick to fold it and put it away. And, of course, he leaves the toilet seat up. I have lived with males for most of my life. But neither of my brothers does that...call me spoiled.</p> <p>The adjustment for me has been having to stop being so indecisive when it comes to what I want to eat or do. I\u2019ve also had to get back in the habit of washing dishes regularly. I haven\u2019t been responsible for dishes in a while, as my mom got her dishwasher fixed a while back. In the effort to \u201cchoose my battles,\u201d I have just learned to fold his clothes when they're done and to put the seat down. I have never done this for other people before.

I remember when were in the pre-engagement phase, Kenny told me that he thought I didn't like him because I'm not \"chatty\" like other girls. I have to be very intentional about saying what's on my mind and talking about my day, as it doesn't come naturally to me. I've noticed about myself that I'm more likely to talk when prompted or asked a question; rarely do I just volunteer information.

I was done with school and wouldn't start working full time for a couple of weeks. All I had was time.

It was my honeymoon. Given the circumstances of COVID, as COVID is going into its junior year, we were not really sure of when we could actually do a honeymoon and so it was either do it now or wait and we really didn't want to wait. The original plan was to go to Hawaii but Hawaii had at the time more restrictions in place than practically the rest of the United States. Thus we decided maybe we should go somewhere else and that resulted in deciding on going on a cruise since neither of us had been on a cruise before. The scary part about going on a cruise was that the week prior to our departure date the cruises that were coming back to Shore or back to the mainland were COVID positive. One of them actually had 55 cases on board and were denied entry to 2 countries that were part of their stops. They had to continue on their journey and they were given credit for the excursions that they had paid for as well as a voucher I believe for a future Cruise. Having read all of this in the news we decided hey we're still going to go and we're going to pray about everything and hopefully we get there and back safely without  getting COVID.  Given that the cruise lines had been through this before I believe they already implemented some procedures in place but they may have extended those procedures even further prior to our cruise date so I'm going to talk about my experiences going on a cruise in the pandemic.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.01.06-i-took-a-cruise-during-the-pandemic/#before-boarding-the-ship","title":"Before Boarding The Ship","text":"<p>As part of going on a cruise with Royal Caribbean one of the requirements is that you had to have a negative COVID test within 2 days prior to your departure date. This became very challenging because of the fact 2 days prior to departure date was Christmas Eve and nobody is giving out a COVID test on Christmas day so we had to get one on Christmas Eve. they strongly advise against getting one on the day of your departure date as it may not necessarily be accurate. However they were administering COVID test on site at the terminal in case you did not have a COVID test prior to arriving at the terminal. Those on-site tests were $105 each and they did not accept any insurance at all so you had to pay for it out-of-pocket. Luckily we were able to get those COVID tests ahead of time and were admitted to board the ship. In addition to having a negative COVID test prior to getting to the terminal you also had to show proof of  a completed COVID vaccination. For those that are not eligible such as kids for a COVID vaccination they were still allowed to board but only because of the fact they were not in the group that were able to be vaccinated. Those who are eligible for vaccination, basically anybody over the age of 12 were required to have been vaccinated in order to board the ship. Once that verification process was done after three different individuals looked at the COVID vaccination documentation including the vaccine card and the negative COVID test you were then given a wristband that you were to wear the entire duration of the cruise. This particular wristband you may have had once before which is the type that does not come off once you put it on unless you cut it off.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.01.06-i-took-a-cruise-during-the-pandemic/#while-on-the-ship","title":"While On The Ship","text":"<p>A number of measures were put in place on board the ship. The most noticeable was the use of hand sanitizer stations basically everywhere you looked except in your staterooms. At the elevator, at each of the restaurants, in areas where multiple people would be such as the theater\u2026 all of these places had sanitizer stations at the entrances to them. Furthermore on the first few days of the cruise, cruise staff words actually station next to these hand sanitizer stations and were telling people who walked past them that they had to sanitize their hands before they enter the area. After about the first few days people got the hint and well they just automatically did it going forward for the rest of the cruise. In addition any time that you were inside of the ship in a common area other than your stateroom you were required to wear your mask over your mouth and nose. If you did not have it over your mouth and nose as I saw several people lacking oh, the crew staff within asked you to make sure you pull your mask all the way up and wear it appropriately. There are areas of the ship that you were not required to wear masks and those particular  areas were around the pool, on the walking Track, and other areas outside of the ship.</p> <p>When we got aboard the ship, there were several shows of Grease the musical that were to be performed by several of the crew staff. However those first two showings were canceled on the first two days of the cruise. A reason for those cancellations was not provided if I recall correctly but later when they were to be rescheduled for Thursday and Friday the reason was being provided for why those shows would not be performed at all. The reason being was that some of those cast members for Grease the musical actually had COVID and they had been quarantined in their dorm and or staterooms during the entire duration of the cruise. As a consolation to the guests on the cruise they were going to get some of the non COVID positive Cruise staff to perform the musical selections from Grease that they could perform.

In some cases like in Mexico you actually had to wear your mask even if you were outside.  One of the places that we went to in Mexico actually did temperature checks on the wrist and required that you sanitize your hand before entry. When it came to the Honduras and the Bahamas I did not experience temperature checks or as many hand sanitizing stations or availability like it was in Mexico.

As a result, real world tests failed and  resulted in destroyed transmissions. Belts popping in transmissions with less than 2K miles, that the TCM  had a bad math algorithm, and under certain conditions, that algorithm would send the transmission back to its maker (because Nissan requires that dealers send warranty repair parts back to Nissan for analysis). The TSB fixes  for the transmissions were to correct that bad path.

The majority of the failures that I have heard about were due to people failing to change the transmission fluid at the appropriate interval. My thoughts  are that the cones that are inside the CVT transmission, can operate within a particular viscosity range of transmission fluid.</p> <p>As the fluid becomes dirty and breaks down over time, they do not provide the correct amount of pressure to the  cones, thus keeping tension on the belt or chain (V6 engines have chains, 4-cylinders have belts) becomes more difficult.  In the worse case scenario, too much pressure is applied to the belt, and as a result the belt pops. Not enough pressure  could be applied to the belt, and as a result the transmissions slips or in the worse case comes off the cones  completely and doesn't break.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.03.10-nissan-cvt-transmission/#manual-transmissions","title":"Manual Transmissions","text":"<p>When manuals were more common, you didn't have to change fluid in them because they didn't have any.

In addition, the one that uses brake fluid to control the clutch,  if the fluid went low, the brake light on the dash would come on indicating a problem.</p> <p>It seems to me that not changing the fluid in transmissions is still a thing today. Some that manufacturer geared automatic transmissions do not have a problem with theirs because a geared design is more tolerant to pressure changes than a  a cone design. However a gear design can fail just as easily as a CVT because they are now making the geared  transmissions with 10 or 12 gears and have just as many parts when you combine the gears, clutches, friction plates,  and more. </p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.03.10-nissan-cvt-transmission/#my-keys-for-longevity","title":"My Keys for Longevity","text":"<p>These are my thoughts on how to get the longest life out of your CVT: </p> <ul> <li>get the fluid changed per the service interval in your owner's manual</li> <li>you can drive it hard, contrary to what  Scotty Kilmer may say, but do not always act like you are in a NASCAR race</li> <li>monitor when TSBs are released.

Sometimes those routes are not  the most perferred routes because they go through residential neighborhoods or the road least travelled.</p> <p>For example, when paying attention to and experimenting, I have found that a stretch of road has  approximately 8 traffic lights on a section of the road. When the first light in the series changes green, if traffic moves about 45-50 MPH, then traffic will get caught at light number 7, and then  get caught at light number 8 because there's usually a delay with traffic pulling off. Now  on the same stretch, and driving about 60+ MPH, you can get through all 8 lights in that series.  Thus you have saved one stop and shorted the idle time. With this suggestion, I am not saying  do anything illegal, but adjust your driving so that you can better time the lights when  they are green.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.03.15-driving-more-efficiently/#tire-pressure","title":"Tire Pressure","text":"<p>Check your tire pressures and make sure that they are within the manufacturer's specifications.  With a smaller vehicle, it is not always noticable. However with a bigger one, it can be more  easily noticable with the drop in fuel economy and the amount of gas pedal required to get  up to speed.  When doing long drives, if the tire pressure on the truck is slightly under inflated, the  vehicle will not go into 4 cylinder mode on some stretches of road that it would go into that  mode when the tires are properly inflated. I believe this has to do with the increased  resistance that a under inflated tire has and thus higher engine load is needed to keep the  vehicle moving even when all other factors are the same.</p> <p>For my vehicles, I actually inflate them slightly over spec. The rason is that I notice that  the vehicle has a tendency to handle slightly better (less resistance to wind when passing an an 18-wheeler).

For vehicles I have driven, I have  found that those circumstances are, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>not driving fast enough to operate in the next gear up. Vehicles are programmed  with the minimum acceptable speed for each gear.  Drive slower than that minimum speed and the vehicle will automatically down shift to keep the engine from stalling or driving roughly.</li> <li>already in the top gear, thus no other gear to shift up to. In my experience, most vehicles will shift into their top gear when driving at least 40 to 45 MPH (64 to 72 KMH).</li> <li>driving with overdrive turned off or driving with Towing Mode turned on.  Overdrive gear is the highest gear in the transmission.  In older vehicles, the gear shift would have a  \"D\" with a circle around it that meant overdrive and \"D\" without a circle for drive (no overdrive).  In modern vehicles, to disable overdrive, there's usually a button on the gearshift to disable  this mode, which when disabled activates an indicator on the instrument cluster (may say \"O/D OFF\"). With overdrive turned off or Towing Mode turned on, the transmission will operate with different  shift points which results in the engine running at a higher RPM and more gas being consumed.</li> <li>driving in Sport Mode instead of Normal or Economy Mode. When in Sport Mode, vehicles usually will stay in the same gear longer and less likely to upshift quickly.

Add to that, one of my wisdom teeth did not grow in straight. So much for being  the smart teeth. The wisdom tooth that grew in sideways, pushed the other teeth on that row forward. Some of the teeth actually got out of alignment because of the sideways wisdom tooth. Long story short, my teeth are all out of alignment. </p> <p>From this and other reason, I agreed to go ahead and get braces.

I only have them on the top  at the moment as the ones on the bottom will come at a later date.  I will definitely say that it changes things.  My under bite was extensive enough that I could touch the braces that they put on the top  with my teeth on the bottom. The orthodontist put spacers on my last molars at the top and  to prevent me from knocking off the brackets with my teeth.</p> <p>This is when I then found out that one side of my mouth is really out of alignment to the point that I can close my mouth all the way on my right side, but cannot close it all the way  on the left side. On occasion, my jaw does pop it and may be related to that. I did have one  occurrence where my jaw popped loudly, but I did not have any pain.

However, with braces you have to floss more than you want to because  food gets stuck all over your mouth. Had some Chinese food one day and some of the rice was  stuck between my cheek and the top of my braces. Had to put my finger in my mouth (washing them first of course) to get the rice unstuck. </p> <p>The hygienist did tell me about the floss plackers that are specifically designed for  people with braces.  They are like the normal floss plackers, but they have a real thin side that is designed to fit  under your braces. Normal plackers are usually to thick to do this. I did manage to get a pack of these and noted that they were more expensive than the normal plackers. </p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.07.15-eating-with-braces/#food","title":"Food","text":"<p>Eating has definitely changed. Things like chips, crackers, and other hard items are impossible  to eat because you have to chew with your back teeth. Trying to chew with your front teeth  is painful and depending on the food, might brake off your braces. </p> <p>It also takes me far longer to eat now because I have to break my food up in to pieces before  I can eat it since I can't bite with my front teeth (incisors). </p> <p>Some times the soft foods like beans have hurt because the pain does radiate from the front to  other nearby teeth. </p> <p>I am not big on candy. That said, basically every website, pamplet, and video that I have  watched in relation to the foods that you can and cannot eat with braces, basically say that  no candy is acceptable, especially if it is sticky. This is probably a good thing as most  candy in America has some sort of artificial sugar and higher than normal consumption of  could lead to diabetes and more. </p> <p>I will say that because it takes more effort to eat, and that eating the wrong thing could  make the treatment take longer to complete, I have eaten less snacks this week than what  I normally do. </p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.07.15-eating-with-braces/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>My typical 3 minute routine of brushing teeth is now more like a 5 to 10 minute one.

I went back and watched our conversation again during October 2022 to make sure that I was still on track  and making the moves that we had discussed.</p> <p>One of the topics that did come up was the YouTube channel and that it was a bit all over the place. It  clearly had suffered from a branding crisis. In my defense, it was me figuring out how things worked, and  when I saw something that stuck, I would then continue with it. </p> <p>Fast foward to recently, I was looking at the analytics for my channel. I noticed that the videos that  relate to home improvement and automotive repair would regularly get more comments and views in comparison to those that were related to software and web development. This led me to research on having a niche channel and targeting a specific audience. I found that most channels do have a specific realm or niche that they stay within, while some channels are all over the place and still get a number of views. </p> <p>People that I know personally had asked before whether I considered splitting the content up by topic, and  my response would be that I did not want to do that since the content is all related to the business.  I could kinda pick up that they did not think that there should be a mix of content on the same channel,  and that they would probably consider subscribing if there was one niche of content on the channel  instead of multiple. </p> <p>Based on the opinions and data the above, I decided to split the channel accordingly. I posted a video  about the split and did receive positive feedback. Those that were interested in the software and more  technical aspects did subscribe to the new channel that I created.</p> <p>The original channel, named  Robinson Handy and Technology Services will continue to do only home improvement and the occasional car related video.  The new channel,  Tech Talk with RHT Services will focus on software development, web development, home automation, Linux, and more technical  topics that the home improvement audience is not as interested in.</p>"},{"location":"lifestyle/2022.12.23-postpartum-depression-and-bipolar-disorder/","title":"Postpartum Dispression and BiPolar Disorder","text":"<p>Approximately two weeks after my wife had our daughter, she had what myself and her family observed as  a manic episode.

The Raspberry Pi outputs 3.3VDC from the GPIO pins. Those pins are connected to a relay board. The relay board is also connected to a 120VAC which is needed by each of the signals. When the Pi sends an \"on\" signal to the relay board, the relay activates, thus sending 120VAC from the source (in this case a wall outlet) to the signal and then corresponding signal then turns on.</p>"},{"location":"projects/traffic-pi/#wiring","title":"Wiring","text":"<p>The color of each wire always denotes its purpose.

However, the second floor often times gets too hot because heat rises and cold air sinks.</p> <p>Several houses in the neighborhood have window AC units installed in the rooms on the upper floor of their house and so do I. The thing about the window units is that they have basic thermometers on them.  Thus I built a .NET Core application that will read the temperature from a temperatture sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. Home Assistant has been configured to connect to the  Raspberry Pi via API to get the current temperature. Then based on automation rules, will either turn on or  off the window air conditioner units.</p> <p>I have several Rapsberry Pi (or Raspberry Pis) that are used in my home and used as television set top boxes. Instead of purchasing additional devices to detect temperature, I decided to get some one-wire temperature sensors that can be connected to the Raspberry Pi that is already in the rooms that I want to monitor.</p> <p>The application was build using .NET 5.0 Web API template. The way it works is that a GET call is made to the  API. The API runs a process to get the current temperature from the temperature sensor and then returns it  back to the caller as a JSON object.

There are many different types of roles and ways to get into tech, that there is no one answer to this  question. My suggestion is that you look to see what interests you the most.  Once you have narrowed those down, watch YouTubers or discuss with individuals on LinkedIn or Twitter  that do similar work to find out more about that particular role. From that point, you can then narrow your list down further to one option.  Once you have that final option, find online resources (online courses, YouTube series),  books, conferences, workshops, and groups that relate to the work that you are interested in and be an  active participant in each of those.</p> <p>A wrote a blog post based on a presentation that I  attended.

Also visas have to be renewed  every 5 to 10 years depending on your status, elgibility, and other requirements. </p> <p>For that reason, some companies do not hire people that require sponsorship.

The reason is that if you have experience, then that demonstrates and validates to the  interviewer that you know what you are talking about.

The problem that I have encountered is that the HR recruiter will see my resume Business Adminstration degree listed on it and almost immediately disqualify me because the job requirements are for a Computer Science, Information Systems,  Mathematics, or engineering-related degree.

I suggested that she look into  Business Analyst or Project Management roles.

I suggested that she consider working as a technician repairing and maintaining medical equipment (e.g. heart monitors, blood pressure machines, MRI machine, etc).  Also suggested that this individual consider working for an MSP (Managed Service Provider) that contracts or  provides services to hospitals and health care facilities.  Having a medical background would give her an advantage because she knows how those machines should work and  would only have to learn the technical aspect of the machines. In addition, having previously worked in a hospital environment, she would already be familiar with hospital procedures and protocols. </li> <li>Individual has worked decades in automotive manufacturing and currently works in facilities maintenance. He does  not have a degree, nor did he want to go back to college to get a degree. However, he did want to make  a career change over to a tech role.

If you do, do you hate having to backup or keep files synchronized on both computers?  Well we have a solution for you.</p> <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: I can use Google Drive (formerly Google Docs) or DropBox or SkyDrive or some other online file storage service and just download it from there when I need it.</p> <p>While that\u2019s true, but everyone has files that they want to keep classified and off the internet.</p> <p>So how do you sync files on your Windows computer the easy way.  Use SyncToy!  SyncToy is from Microsoft.  The features it has includes: allows you to sync the files on two or more computers with a central computer over your wired or wireless network, allows you to exclude files, and allow you overwrite files in an existing location.  It works with Windows XP or later and has a 32 and 64-bit versions.  If you use the sync feature, it will compare the files in directories on both computers.  When a difference is detected it will update the computer that contains the older version of the file or that does not have the file.  Best of all, it\u2019s free to download and use!</p> <p>Some members of the BBIT team have been using SyncToy to keep the files between their laptop and desktop synced and to have backup copies of their documents, music, etc in case one computer were to crash or be stolen.  It has been stated that it could have more functionality, but it does get the job done.  If you have a lot of files or large files (i.e. videos, movies, etc), we would recommend that you do the syncing overnight or when you aren\u2019t in the office.</p> <p>If you would like to download SyncToy, go to the download page located at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155.</p>"},{"location":"technology/2015.06.28-installing-drupal-7-on-1-and-1-web-hosting/","title":"Installing Drupal 7 on 1 and 1 Web Hosting","text":"<p>Unless you use the \"click to build\" tool that is provided by 1 and 1, Drupal 7 requires some knowledge to set up on their servers.

cover building a web application without doing any coding like at all so and just for a little kicks and giggles all right so Who am I i'm kenny robinson I have a bachelors from in business from the university Alabama so I have a minor in computer science my day job is still in production support as an IT consultant and who's doing the automations data analysis process improvements the whole nine yards you can look me up on LinkedIn that is the URL and also have a github account if you go to the hacking I'm not doing my day job I'm doing stuff like this and this is a actual traffic light and the box in my hand is a Raspberry Pi connected with relays that I programmed and this particular scenario I was demonstrating it to kids teaching them how they can use computer science with electrical engineering you know it's possible career paths all right so what is Drupal Drupal is a content management system most people are familiar with WordPress or Drupal Joomla and Drupal is kind of the I won't say the redheaded stepchild kind of the fairy bleep snow it is open source it is created by dries fight art he's also a DC I think he's the chief information officer a company called aqua which drupal functionality outside of the core can be extended by using modules and WordPress people know this as plugins but it's the same concept Drupal is not often used because it is more technically advanced and you have to have more familiarity with it how to use it just more hands-on experience the current versions are version 7 and version 8 version 7 is still popular because of the fact those modules that exist to extend the functionality have to be rewritten for the new framework that is being used in version 8 so a lot of the sites including the one I'm going to use today it's written in Drupal 7 Trippel does have a command-line interface is known as thrush has packages in Ubuntu and maybe a other linux distros there's not one on Windows as far as I know and if you want to look up more about football the website is true filled out over all right so most people think intact I've never used the Drupal website not so fast so there are several websites the white house the FEMA and the Weather Channel all use Drupal behind the scenes The Weather Channel recently did they did a major upgrade probably roughly two to three years ago to switch over to the Drupal platform and as you know whether The Weather Channel does weather everywhere so they have millions of data elements that they are trying to law the track used for historical references pulling data from other places like the National Weather Service and so forth so if you want to read about that you can read up on the case study FEMA also has the Drupal website whoa and what they're still using like apps you know we go out in fields in the disaster areas like Florida for instance for the recent hurricane and this interface you know the Drupal website allows them to interface from their phones in the field and a lot of times if you look at a website you can conative whether it is Google based or not in the White House website there's this meta tag that does say rupal 7 is the generator of the site all right so I use Drupal in my personal setup one of which is farm OS farm OS is a particular truthful distribution and it allows for a YouTube manage is intended for usage with the farm but it's also can be used I use it as for garden and managing like grass and stuff like that so in that particular screenshot actually took a striking the red peppers that I've ever this year and decided to take a photo uploaded into Drupal and also use the data to track how much another use that I have for it is issue tracker so kind of like github has issues I use the same thing but for tracking issues with my house and with my vehicle and one other use you can use is automation you can Drupal has the capabilities of sending and receiving restful quests so for instance if you want let's say is you tracker to connect to my farm of s I can have my issue tracker trigger you know let's say something happen let's say I added an issue with the grass well that issue could be sent to farm OS and it's like well you create an issue over there let me log it over here as well and that allows for across you know automating tasks another thing that I've done is with farm or lest I have it pulling data from the National Weather Service the National Weather Service has an XML feed that is available for each locality so by pulling that data I'm able to use that to determine whether it has rain or not and if it has a range within the last seven days I have farmer les send the email saying there has been no rain you need to water the grass so there's many many uses of them all right now into the demonstration so these are the notes we're going to assume they're not great at coding or do not know how to code you have one business day to do everything with this particular project there are no project plans in advance it has to be a web-based application it has to have a mobile API and it must be browser friendly and you also have to like the ability to log into the website to do have the client to be able to log into their own updates thinking all right so we're gonna do this and it work when I tested it but as I do production support on the daily basis let's hope it still works all right so first things first we're going all right so all of the code that I'm gonna be showing this whole repo is here on github like I say you can link to my page from the hacking jam page as I'm a member on there and all the instructions that we'll be covering are listed here if we run across something that's not quite right I'll go back and correct it afterwards all right so the first thing we'll do is to set up Drupal so I have my dev server set up with the code files already in place so normally you would just go set rupal files put them in place so if your web server so forth alright then we'll do the standard installation and we're choosing English Music it's like we're already calling the fire department there we go okay so normally you have to enter your database credentials and it will prompt you give you a form so the database name the user ID password and the server credentials you would enter those but since I already have a settings.php file in place if you skip that particular part of the process all right the next step is to enter the site name so we'll just call it fast web app for short you have to enter the site email address Drupal has the capabilities of sending emails out all right then you set up your settings obviously we're in the United States time zone if you want update notifications you can put these in place if not you can easily just turn them off and save them continue all right and once loop was done it'll allow you to log into the website all right so with the standard installation you get a lot of additional modules installed that you really don't need so what we're going to do is we're going to turn those off and these steps are also again in the github readme file so we don't need comments dashboard database logging overlay and shortcut all right and then we do need to turn on some additional modules to get honest functionality so we need scrolling down we need see tools this is called see tools for short but it was chaos tools services which will enable the usage of REST API and then we also need the rest server alright and we could continue if you forget to check something Drupal says hey I need this to complete this you just turn it on either way all right so we'll go back to the home page and we're gonna create a new content type well new content when you use the standard into installation it creates the article in the basics page content types for most of if you're just creating static pages you'll use the basic page type and we will say all right so now we have the first page is active and it can be accessed at this URL all right so now that we have one page in place we're going to make this site mobile-friendly so there's a theme here called Mayo and we're gonna enable that and also set it as the default and then we'll go into settings and with Drupal a lot of times the configuration items do not initially save to the database when you set them up so it's always best to go in and save the options even if you don't change them initially all right so this is our mobile friendly thing and if you resize it you see how it kind of puts everything in a single column but if you expanded there's the sidebar that's over here now so we've completed the the mobile browser version of this all right so the next is to go to the structure and we can rearrange the items on the page like if you wanted to search bar to be below the navigation go to structure locks and here are each of the blocks and so there are additional blocks at the bottom that you're not using if you want to move them around life I wanted to get rid of this power by Drupal just move it down to the disable section and if I went to search box below the navigation I can move it there and then hit safe and so now you see the search box is below the navigation and also the Drupal footer is removed right same concept different name alright so now that we've done our page layout we can go and create our REST API so we go to structure again and services and so we're gonna add an endpoint and we're going to name the endpoint now the machine name is the internal name think of it as like the unique identifier for that particular service so we're gonna name it API and machine names have to be lowercase if not if you type the wrong thing again and it will display an error and the server we're going to select is the rest server this is one of the options that we turned on did our module updates so we're not gonna do session authentication that's a little bit more complex for this particular demonstration and so we'll save and now we have our REST API available so we'll go to edit resources and we need to be able to pull content from that REST API so we're going to note is a so in Drupal there's a concept of entities and users are entities pages which we refer to as nodes are also entities and taxonomy which is kind of like keywords or categories also known as entity are types of entities so with the node entity basically basically page is a type of node and they know it is a type of an entity so in order to be able to access the page that we did create we'll need to be able to retrieve a node and if you want to list all of the pages you'll need to turn on the indexing of a node you can create nodes but we won't do that in this demo that's also a little bit more advanced so now that we have our retrieve and index capabilities turned on for our API we will get save all right so the next thing is to test the rest API is Firefox Chrome as an extension not for sure of what it is but I do know that Firefox also has an extension called poster all right and you can take this URL so by default when you do a API request and will return the XML but if you put dot JSON at the end of it you will get a JSON response and so here is our Dixon response that shows the full list since we only have one node is only listing that one node but if there were additional nodes it would show those as well all right and to get only just that particular node you specify the node ID and the node ID can be found by either going to the page and looking at the URL or you if you're looking at a database you'll see it the same way you'll have this unique identifier over one so we just append that to the URL and do a get request and these are all the elements in that the revision ID we have the user ID the title status whether the node is visible to the public or not his commenting turned it on turned on or not is it promoted to the front page and various other elements in here as well so now you have a fully functioning web application that is also mobile friendly and it did not take you eight hours to build it with the rest API so any questions and yes you can have more questions yes it is it's the quick and short version there it is a little bit more elaborate if you want to get more involved as far as like you can with the Bicentennial application that we're building we actually have custom additional content types that we're using and that allows for us to have additional fields so we can go in and put in let's see so we can specify field types these are just the default types but but I'll say you can add additional modules there's an email fill type there's an address field type there's all kinds of additional field types that can be added and it will do validation on that type you know if you make it mandatory what is it this is my sequel but it also supports sequel Lite I think it is yes yes we have some of them available we do have some of them available but we're still working on everything else we have a high level view of everything at this point then we'll tweak it as need be yes trying to get so I'll give you a history of I'll give you a history on that so where I work my our clients we had a system you know the system that does all the access provisioning and so the I guess the root user is called I am admin so I just kind of took it from that alright so here's the historic marker content type and so in here we have the stuff that you would probably think that would be necessary so like what county is it in what city location don't ya picture the ability to put pictures in here as well yes yes and see even even if you don't want to Jason even if you don't want to Jason output also you</p>"},{"location":"technology/2017.11.14-enable-and-setup-ufw-on-ubuntu-16.04/","title":"Enable and Setup UFW on Ubuntu

Currently I build automations using Selenium WebDriver and Sikuli to automate routine daily tasks. Since I maintain multiple websites,  I figured that I could use this same technology to perform the code updates on the websites that I manage. Selenium WebDriver has some first time setup steps that have to be done in order for you to be able to build the automations. My browser of choice is Firefox. Some people reading this will not be thrilled about that, but everyone has their preferences. If you  like to use Chrome, or worse Internet Explorer, then the steps mentioned below are similar to those for Firefox. However this post focuses on setting up with Firefox. First thing that you will need to do is to have Eclipse or similar IDE installed on your computer. That will not be covered in this post.</p> <p>Next, download the Gecko Driver. That can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver.  The Gecko Driver serves as a middle man between WebDriver and the web browser. The web browser cannot directly communicate or  interact with the web browser. What happens is WebDriver interacts with the Gecko Driver. Then the Gecko Driver translates those  interactions into actions that the browser can perform. Once the action is performed, then response is sent back from the browser to the Gecko Driver to WebDriver. Next, create a Maven project. In the pom.xml file, you will need to add the following dependency to the file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;\n &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n &lt;version&gt;3.14.0&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>At the time of this writing, 3.14.0 version, was the second latest versoin that was available. I would recommend using the latest or later version that is available.  Next, add the Java code below to your main function. This is the simpliest code to get an automation running with Firefox.</p> <pre><code>System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\"); // define geckodriver location\nWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser\ndriver.get(\"http://google.com\"); // open the website of choice\nThread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen\ndriver.quit(); // close browser ```\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver</code> will need to be replaced with the location that you have downloaded the Gecko Driver. If you choose, you may also change the website that the browser opens. Now you may run the application that you have built. If done correctly, you will see the browser open, then the Google home page  appear, then the browser close. There may be some red text in the Java console, but there is no need to be alarmed by this unless there is an exception mentioned. The code used here can be downloaded from my Github repository at  https://github.com/almostengr/seleniumtutorial</p> <p>The entire file Java file would look like the following:</p> <pre><code>package com.thealmostengineer.seleniumtutorial;\n\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\n\n/**\n * Simple webdriver\n *\n */\npublic class App \n{\n    static void geckoDriverTest() throws Exception {\n    System.setProperty(\"webdriver.gecko.driver\", \"/home/almostengineer/java-workspace/geckodriver\");\n        WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // open browser\n        driver.manage().window().maximize(); // maximize the browser window\n        driver.get(\"http://google.com\");\n        Thread.sleep(5000); // allow results to be seen\n        driver.quit(); // close browser\n    }\n\n    public static void main( String[] args )\n    {\n        try {\n        geckoDriverTest();\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"technology/2019.05.07-how-to-install-chrome-on-ubuntu/","title":"How to Install Google Chrome on Ubuntu 18.04","text":""},{"location":"technology/2019.05.07-how-to-install-chrome-on-ubuntu/#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"technology/2019.05.09-automatically-publish-content-with-custom-module/","title":"Automatically Publish Content with Custom Module","text":"<p>If you want to run a blog, one of the best time saving techniques is writing your content ahead of time and then it is released on a schedule that you set. Drupal does have a module that will do just that. However the process to schedule a post was badly designed in my opinion. That being said, I decided to write my own module that would handle this functionality for me. By writing my own module, I can customize the module how I choose without having additional features that I do not need. In case you are wondering whether this works or not, I am using the code below to publish the blog posts on this website.</p> <p>First you'll need to create a content type if you don't already have one. With Drupal 7, go to Structure &gt; Content Types to create a new content type. When creating the content type, take note to the Machine Name that is associated with your content type. You'll need this later.  Next let's take a look at the code:</p> <pre><code>function almostengr_publish_posts() {\n  $result = db_query(\"select nid from {node} where created &amp;lt;= :datetime and promote = :promote and status = :status and type = :type\",\n    array(\":datetime\" =&amp;gt; REQUEST_TIME, \":promote\" =&amp;gt; 1, \":status\" =&amp;gt; 0, \":type\" =&amp;gt; \"article\"));\n  foreach($result as $row) {\n    $article = node_load($row-&amp;gt;nid);\n    $article-&amp;gt;status = 1; // update the status\n    $article-&amp;gt;comment = 2; // enable comments\n    node_save($article); // save article\n  } // end foreach\n} // end function\n</code></pre> <p>The code above queries the node table for the node IDs that have a created date before the current date and time, are selected to be promoted to the front page, are not published, and have a type of article. Then each node that matches the queried condition, will be loaded, have the node status updated to published and the comments enabled, and then saved.  Next need to create a cron process that will handle this further. We will do this in code too.</p> <pre><code>function almostengr_cron() {\n  almostengr_publish_posts();\n} // end function\n</code></pre> <p>With the code above, we are using cron to call the publish posts function. The cron function within the module that you create will be automatically called via the Drupal hook_cron functionality.</p> <p>Now to the creating of content. When you create a new node, you need to do the following for it to be scheduled to be published:</p> <ul> <li>Set the Created Date to the date and time that you wish the article to be published</li> <li>Promoted to Front Page selected</li> <li>Published status is not selected</li> <li>Save the content</li> </ul> <p>That's it.

This change was made by Google in 2018 and some high ranking websites saw their website impressions drop as a result.

It is possible because the features that I most commonly use on Facebook, like uploading photos, posting status updates, checking the news feed, and sending messages, I am all able to do from the mobile website. </p> <p>The only down side to this, if you consider it to be one, is that you do not get real time notifications for comments, likes, or event reminders.

Research has been done in recent years that has proven that we are more connected to each other through our phones and less in person. To add to the frenzy, notifications that you receive often distract you from what you are currently doing or disconnect you from the people that are around you. </p> <p>An example of this would be the couple out to dinner and both of them are on their phones looking at whatever instead of looking at each other having a conversation or paying attention to the restaurant that they are in. </p> <p>Most mobile websites do not have the capabilities to make the browser throw device notifications. Thus you are able to better focus on what you are doing, like paying attention to that driver that is about to cut you off, that your date got a new dress and new heels, or completing that 5 minute task that your boss emailed you about that is taking you 20 minutes to complete. </p> <p>I believe that multi-tasking is a myth. When I really need to get stuff done, I put my phone on vibrate and put it out of sight (e.g. in pocket, another room). Often I'm surprised that I'm able to get so much done in a short amount of time. Then I realize that I was able to focus on one task at a time and work diligently until I was able to complete it. </p> <p>I have a couple of apps that would throw notifications at or around the same time every day wanting me to buy something (Groupon) or to look at an offer (Ibotta) even if I had not opened the app. After a while, this became annoying and I blocked the app from displaying any notifications at the operating system level. </p>"},{"location":"technology/2019.06.16-7-reasons-i-can-do-that-without-the-app/#reason-three-phone-space","title":"Reason Three: Phone Space","text":"<p>Apps take up space.

When people say that they want an app built, the next part of the conversation usually goes like this: </p> <p>KENNY: In the initial version of the app, what would the app do?  CLIENT: Provide information about myself (usually the owner or founder), what we do, and some pictures of our work/services.  KENNY: Anything else beyond that?  CLIENT: No. Oh... wait... and be able to contact us from the app.  KENNY: The going rate to have an iPhone app created is x-thousands of dollars and the cost for an Android app is x-hundreds of dollars.  CLIENT: It costs that much? Let me shop around to see who else I can find. </p> <p>Long story short... they never end up getting the mobile app. Most people will not download an app because they want information about your business. That is what your website is for.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on YouTube family so in this video I'm gonna actually to set up the automatic updates using unattended upgrades on Ubuntu 18.04 so let's get to it thanks for checking out the almost engineer channel if you are visiting for the first time please be sure to subscribe by clicking subscribe button below so automatic updates is a feature available in Ubuntu similar to Windows has Windows updates where it basically up stations the system automatically with little to no effort on your part and so the default setup for automatic updates is that it only updates these security packages however I actually wanted to get it to update everything on the system and so what I'm gonna do is actually run through a number of steps and these steps are available on my website as well as the Ubuntu - Help section of the Ubuntu - website on how to configure some of this so the first thing you'll need to do is to run sudo apt-get install unattended upgrades and I already have that installed it's pretty common I think it's installed by default when you install Ubuntu 18.04 so if you don't have it just run the install command it won't hurt if you already have it it'll tell you you already have it alright so the next thing you go to CD Etsy apt apt Kampf daddy alright and then in this directory there are two files that we're going to edit so the first one is going to be the 50 unattended upgrades and then the next one is going to be the 20 auto upgrades so you're gonna need to sudo for this so 50 unattended upgrades looks like I have a whole backup file I'll probably come back and remove that point so alright do VI and as you see here so there are comments in this file and so basically by defaults like I mentioned it will only install security updates but I want to actually install like general updates as well so I'm going to remove the double slashes here and then do WQ actually gonna go out and open nano you can still do this in VI but nano I'm more familiar with the shortcuts for nano so alright so we've removed the comments for the just standard updates I don't want the proposed or backports consultant unnecessarily stable updates so you only want the stuff that's actually stable so going down if you there are packages that you want to exclude you can uncomment these usually I would leave these as are as they are because you never know when update may happen for those you want the latest version the next option mentions whether you want the development release of Ubuntu to be automated oh great I'm going to leave that at false I want to make sure that I have the latest stable version not the development version so again I'm leaving that one at false all right the next option says that it allows you to control if on an unclean dpkg exit understand the upgrades will automatically run the default is true to ensure that your updates keep getting installed so I will leave that at true so I'll relieve this since this mine is coming it I'll leave that as is alright split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that they can be interrupted with sig term this makes the upgrade a bit slower it has to benefit that shut down while the upgrade is running is possible I'm gonna leave that at false again it's not necessarily but if you need to have that done you can uncomment this and go forward the next option install all unintended upgrades when the machine is shutting down instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running this will obviously make shutdown slower I'm going to leave that commented because I don't when I shut down a system I wanted to go ahead and shut down I don't want it to continue to go ahead and try to install the updates while shutting down all right the next option is to send the email to this address for problems or packages upgrade so basically if there's a problem you'll get an email which also means you also need to have a mail server setup and so since I do development on this particular machine I don't want to setup a mail server to prevent some of those development actions from sending out emails because sometimes you know when you're developing you build our email functionality and the last thing you want is to have a email going out to a actual human user you know in your development face all right so removed used kernels you'll want to let's see I want to uncomment this one and the reason I'm I'm coming this one is uncomment and gonna set this to true and the reason I'm doing that is because of the fact I want the kernel packages removed if you don't remove kernel packages what will happen over time is that the disk space will eventually started getting used up significantly because kernel packages are relatively big on a Linux system and so I went through one day and I actually had about 15 or 20 gigs of packages just sitting that were no longer the latest version so it's like if it's not the latest version why do I still have it and so I removed it so this will handle that automatically so you don't have to manually do it alright the next one do automatic removal of new unused dependency after the upgrade so which is the equivalent of running app get out of remove I do want that and I'm going to uncomment it and then also set it to the true automatically reboot without confirmation and so basically if it finds the reboot file then you wanted to reboot I am leave that one set at false well actually I take that back I'm actually changed this to true because the system does need to reboot I wanted to go ahead and reboot to apply those changes and then the next option I wanted to reboot to am is pretty decent for my particular situation you know at 2:00 a.m. I'm usually not doing anything there may be a chance where a automation of some sort is running in the background not on this particular machine but just in general so this should be sufficient in my opinion all right if you want to set a bandwidth limit you can uncheck this setting frankly I do not care about the bandwidth limit so I believe that as is if you want logging you can set that up I'm gonna leave it as false same thing for the syslog facility download operates only on AC power this particular machine only runs off of AC power there is no battery connected to it so no sense of setting it up because it will always need to be run and then last option is to download and install it grace only on non meter connections I believe that one commented if you're using like a Wi-Fi hotspot or something of that similar nature you'll want to consider enabling this option that way you're not installing you know updates in using all of your allocated bandwidth all right so I'm going to save that file now and the next file I will need to look at is also in the same directory it is the 2002 upgrades so open nano again if you want to use VI you can use VI but I'm using nano alright and so per the documentation on the Ubuntu website it mentions that there are a number of options that we can add in here and so update package lists that the one is already added and recommended to be done also the same thing for the unattended upgrade value set to one alright so the additional options are to add apt periodic and then Auto clean interval and set that a value to seven and so what this will do is it will clean up old download archives every week so again that's about the maintaining the space on the file system keeping it clean and then download upgradable packages is the other option that it mentions that is advisable to be included so you do a periodic download - upgradable packages and set that by you equal to one with a semicolon and then that is it for that one alright oops save then exit alright so once you have done that if you are using like version control for your SC directory you'll want to commit those changes so I'm going to go ahead and do that now at - ooh sudo get status just to confirm that those are added and sudo get commit and then we're going to do updated the unattended upgrade settings actually I need to change that to updated so go back alright and then for safekeeping I need to push that up alright so my commit has been pushed up so that this configuration change has now been saved and if something happens to this system in the future all I have to do is pull that configuration back down and it is good to go so hopefully this video has helped you in configuring your unattended upgrade set up on your Ubuntu to 18.04 machine if you have any questions or you know have any differences in the process of how you use unattended upgrades leave a comment in the comment section below also please be sure to check out my website they almost engineer comm

(Unedited)","text":"<p>WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANKS TO YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO AND IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION ON WORDPRESS HERE WE GO Music ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK SO IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS VIDEO SERIES OF ME MOVING MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE PROGRESSION THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO AS FAR AS CONVERTING THE EXISTING SITE OVER IT'S A WORDPRESS MOVING CONTENT AND SO FORTH ONE FEATURE I WANT TO ADD IS TO HAVE A MAILING LIST FUNCTIONALITY ON MY WEBSITE AND SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO USE CP CRM I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING WHY DID I NOT USE LIKE A MAILCHIMP OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF SERVICE THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE I DID THINK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO WHEN YOU'RE USING THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES ONE OF WHICH IS COST SO USUALLY THERE IS A THRESHOLD OF ONCE YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU HAVE TO START PAYING ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR DATA AND SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN POINT AND SAY WELL TO PAY TO GET YOUR DATA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW SO IT'S EASIER TO COME OUT HOST YOUR OWN THINGS USING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M USING SEVERE CRM FOR THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE SO AS I DISCUSSED IN LAST VIDEO SEVERE CRM IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE SOME USE CASES FOR STUFF OUTSIDE OF A NONPROFIT ARENA ALL RIGHT SO SWITCHING OVER TO THE COMPUTER I DID INSTALL SUPER CRM IN MY LAST VIDEO SO IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THAT GO BACK AND WATCH THAT THERE WILL BE A PLAYLIST TO ALL THE VIDEOS OF THIS WEBSITE CONVERSION SERIES DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW SO WHEN YOU GO INTO CIVIC CRM FROM THE DASHBOARD THERE IS A OPTION TO DO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND SO YOU CLICK THAT IT BRINGS YOU TO A LIST OF ITEMS ON YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLED AND SO WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS WHEN I'M SETTING UP A CIVIC CRM INSTALLATION I START FROM THE TOP AND JUST WORK MY WAY DOWN AND MAKE SURE I HIT EVERY SCREEN EVEN IF I'M NOT CHANGING ANY SCREENS I JUST MAKE SURE I JUST GO DOWN A LIST AND COVER EVERYTHING BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS LIST I BUY - I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR SCREEN BUT IT'S THERE SO I'M GONNA START FROM THE TOP WE HAVE LOCALIZATION ALRIGHT AND SO HERE WE SET THE LANGUAGE I'M GONNA CHANGE THIS DEFAULT EXCUSE ME INHERITS EMS LANGUAGE WHICH IS CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - YES AND THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE WILL SET THAT AS A SITE LANGUAGE AS WELL CURRENCY I AM IN THE UNITED STATES SO I WANT TO USE USD AND I'M GONNA LEAVE THE AVAILABLE ONES - USD I'M NOT SURE HOW WILL THEN WILL CONVERT BUT YOU KNOW IF I'M USING SOME KIND OF PAYMENTS I BELIEVE PAYPAL WILL HANDLE THAT PRETTY WELL SO NO CONCERN IS THERE MY DEFAULT COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES SO I'M GOING TO SET THAT THERE AND THE DEFAULT PROVINCE I BELIEVE THAT ONE BLANK FOR THE CONTACT ADDRESS FIELD SO I WANT TO DO THE AVAILABLE COUNTRIES ARE CANADA AND GOING TO DO UNITED STATES OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO DO THE COUNTRY THAT YOUR HAND AND SPACE AND PROMISES YOU GOT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THOSE SO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES AND YOU'RE ABLE TO JUMP AROUND HERE BY USING THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THAT BUT LIKE I WANTED TO GO TO A COUNTRY THAT STARTED WITH L I JUST TYPE SELECT AND CHECK IN THE BOX AND THEN HIT L ON THE KEYBOARD AND YOU CAN EVEN TYPE OUT THE NAME IN HERE AND IT'LL JUMP DOWN TO THAT ALRIGHT AND ENABLE MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I WILL IN DUE TIME BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING IS THE ORGANIZATION ADDRESS AND CONTACT INFORMATION SO THIS IS LIKE I SAY IT IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS THE OXYGENATOR OKAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR LIKE YOU KNOW BUILT BUSINESSES THAT I'M SORRY I'LL PUT THE WRONG THING THERE ONCE YOU PUT A MAIN STREET HERE AND A CITY AND MAKE UP A ZIP CODE AND THERE ARE NO COUNTIES FOR THE UNITED STATES I DON'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY HAS CREATED A COMPONENT FOR THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE COUNTIES FOR OTHER LOCATIONS MORE SO OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE I AM THIS WILL BE BLANK AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE ORGANIZATION CONTACT INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW EMAIL ADDRESS EAR AND IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION PUT THAT IN THERE AND SO THAT INFORMATION WILL ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN THE EMAILS THAT YOU SEND OUT ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST IS THE ENABLE CIVIC CRM COMPONENTS I AM ONLY GOING TO BE USING MAIL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS EVENTS GRANTS PLEDGES CASES REPORTS AND CAMPAIGNS I WON'T ELABORATE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BEANS IN THEIR FUNCTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO TO SEE PCRM ORG AND READ UP ON THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THERE ABOUT THAT SO I'M ONLY USING MAIL AND REPORT SO I'M GONNA JUST GO AHEAD AND SAVE ALL RIGHT AND SO REGISTER YOUR SITE SO CIVIC CRM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THEIR MODULE OR SO SO YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE MAILING LISTS AND THAT THEY NOTIFY YOU OF WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING I'VE ALREADY DONE IT SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU IT TAKES YOU THROUGH THEIR SITE AND IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU THERE ALL RIGHT THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY PREFERENCES AND SO WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FIELDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WELL AS TABS I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M GOING TO UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING SO LIKE CONTRIBUTIONS MEMBERSHIPS TAGS I'LL LEAVE THAT CHECK EVENTS CASES GRANTS PLEDGES I'M NOT USING I WILL LEAVE MAILINGS CHECKED AS WELL AND SO THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT WHEN YOU ARE EDITING A CONTACT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF FIELDS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED I'M GONNA LEAVE THOSE SELECTED FOR NOW I MAY CHANGE IT AT A LATER POINT WHEN GOING TO DO A SEARCH FOR A CONTACT YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF CRITERIA HERE THAT YOU SEE I LIKE I SAID I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING THIS RELATES TO THE CONTACT SEARCH AND THE CONTACT DASHBOARD AGAIN I'M GOING TO UNCHECK SOME OF THIS STUFF HERE BECAUSE I AM NOT USING IT ALL RIGHT CIVIC CRM ALSO DOES HAVE A WYSIWYG EDITOR BUILT INTO IT THAT'S JUST SELECTING SETTING THAT AND THE DISPLAY NAME OF EACH PERSON IS ALREADY CONFIGURED IN HERE BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I BELIEVE THE THEME THE WAY IT IS YOU CAN SET IT TO A DIFFERENT THING BUT LEAVE IT AS IS ALRIGHT NEXT IS ADDRESS SETTINGS AND SO IT HAS THE ADDRESS AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULTED TO THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT OTHER DETAILS IN HERE USING THESE TOKENS OR TAKE THESE SOME OF THESE DETAILS OUT I AM GOING TO UNCHECK LATITUDE BECAUSE I HAVE NO NEED FOR LATITUDE AND I'LL LEAVE I'LL UNCHECK COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRACKING THE COUNTY IN HERE AND IF YOU WANT TO USE A ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION PROVIDER YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN YOUR CREDENTIALS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM THEM THIS LINK HERE WILL TAKE YOU THERE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SETTING THAT PART UP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT SO I'MA LEAVE IT BLANK NEXT IS MAPPING IN GEOCODING SO IF YOU'RE TRACKING ADDRESSES YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THESE MAPPING PROVIDERS HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THE SETUP IT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A KEY AND YOU CAN PUT THAT KEY IN HERE AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING THOSE ADDRESSES YOU CAN PULL UP THAT CONTACTS INFORMATION HERE AND IT WILL SHOW YOU ON A MAP WHERE THAT ADDRESS THAT THAT CONTACT HAS IS LOCATED IN THE WORLD AGAIN I'M NOT USING THAT IT'S JUST I'M ONLY DOING SENDING OUT EMAILS FROM HERE NEXT IS THE SEARCH PREFERENCES SO PRETTY MUCH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY IN HERE I NEED TO CHANGE SO ALL OF THE DEFAULTS ARE FINE BUT BASICALLY THIS ICON UP HERE IS SEARCHES AND YOU CAN CHANGE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR JUST BY SELECTING IT ALL RIGHT SO NICKNAMED A PAGE ORDER QUICK SEARCH OPTIONS I'LL LEAVE THOSE AS IS AND TIM RESULTS ALL RIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUST SAVE IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING I ALWAYS MAKE IT A HABIT OF WHEN I EXIT OUT TO SAVE JUST IN CASE I DO CHANGE SOMETHING THEY FORGET ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ONE IS THE MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS SO CONTRACT CONTACT TRASH AND UNDELETE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT AT YES THAT WAY IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY DELETE SOMETHING YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TRASH AND RESTORE IT DON'T NEED TO DO ANY LOGGING AND I DON'T WANT TO ATTACH PDFS TO THE RECEIPTS THAT MAKE YOUR EMAILS UNNECESSARILY BIGGER AND ALSO MORE LOAD ON YOUR SERVER IF YOU'RE GENERATING LETTERS LIKE IN BATCHES YOU CAN HAVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE THAT HERE I'D RATHER HAVE ONE PER CONTACT SO THAT'S FINE AND THESE ARE OTHER SETTINGS RELATED TO VARIOUS THINGS LIKE SENDING EMAILS AND SO FORTH AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS RECAPTCHA ON HERE IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THAT IT WILL BETTER PROTECT THE FORMS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR SITE OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE AN ERROR HERE SO I BELIEVE MY MAX PHP AND MY EXCUSE ME MAX UPLOAD SIZE AND MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS SET TO 2 MEGABYTES SO I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I ORIGINALLY HAD 3 HERE WHICH WAS THE DEFAULT ALL RIGHT SO NEXT IS THE CONTACT TYPES SO BY DEFAULT THERE ARE THREE CONTENT TYPES BUILT-IN ORGANIZATION HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL DEPENDING ON YOUR USE CASE YOU CAN TURN THESE OFF AND AND OR AB OR OR DELETE THESE THAT ARE HERE FOR RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO DELETE THOSE THAT ARE HERE BUT I AM GOING TO EXCUSE ME DISABLE THOSE NOT DELETE THOSE THAT ARE HERE AND THAT WAY I'LL JUST STICK WITH THE CORE CONTACT TYPES I MAY A LATER DATE AND MORE TYPES HERE BUT FOR NOW JUST HAVING INDIVIDUALS AND HERE IS SUFFICIENT ALL RIGHT SO I'M DONE WITH THAT LET ME GO BACK TO THE CONFIGURATION PAGE ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE DONE CONTENT TYPES NEXT IS THE FROM EMAIL ADDRESS SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE SET WHEN YOU'RE SENDING OUT MAILING LISTS EMAILS THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD SET THAT INFORMATION I'M ASSERTED TO NO REPLY YOU KNOW MOST ENGINEER COMM ALL RIGHT AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT A DESCRIPTION IN HERE YOU CAN ORDER AND WHETHER IT'S THE DEFAULT OPTION ALRIGHT SO THAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA GO BACK THIS TIME TO THAT CHECKLIST BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT SAVE ME TO THE WRONG PLACE OKAY ALL RIGHT OUTBOUND EMAIL SO HERE IS WHERE YOU WOULD SET WHETHER TO SEND EMAIL USING SMTP SO IF YOU'RE WANTING TO USE A GMAIL ADDRESS YOU CAN USE THE SMTP INFORMATION YOU CAN USE THE SMTP OPTION AND THEN PUT THE SMTP INFORMATION IN HERE TO BE ABLE TO USE A GMAIL EVEN ADDRESS OR SOME OTHER SERVER THE DEFAULT OPTION IS THE MAIL BUT YOU COULD ALSO DO SMELL DISABLE ABOUT EMAILS OR HAVE THEM WRITE TO DIRECTLY TO THE DATABASE YOU MAY WANT TO USE THESE LAST TWO OPTIONS IF YOU ARE USING THIS IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT OR YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE EMAILS YOU PROBABLY SEND IN PAPER LETTERS INSTEAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NATURE SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DO REDIRECT TO THE DATABASE BECAUSE THIS IS MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT AND THEN I WANT TO SAVE ON THAT ALL RIGHT PAYMENT PROCESSORS SO IF YOU WANT TO COLLECT PAYMENTS YOU CAN ENTER THAT INFORMATION IN HERE IT HAS A DUMMY PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOU PAID ATTENTION TO THE LAST VIDEO THAT I DID YOU'LL SEE WHERE I WENT IN AND SELECTED THE LOW DUMMY DATA AND SO IT AUTOMATICALLY PUTS A DUMMY PROCESSOR IN HERE HOWEVER I CAN ADD INFORMATION IN HERE FOR PAYPAL SO USING ANY PASSWORD AND SO FORTH AND MAKE THAT ACTUALLY WORK LIKE IT SHOULD AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE WEB PAYMENTS PRO STANDARD AND OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT ALRIGHT SO THAT COVERS PAYMENTS GO BACK TO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST AND THEN NEXT YEAH THE TAGS OR CATEGORIES SO YOU CAN SPECIFY THOSE MANAGE GROUPS SO LIKE LIKE IT GIVES AN EXAMPLE STEERING COMMITTEE AND IF YOU HAVE CUSTOM FORMS OR SCREENS YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN PUT THOSE IN AND THEN LASTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVILLA CRM YOU CAN GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE AND CONFIGURE THOSE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT AND THERE'S PLENTY OF DOCUMENTATION ON THE SAVVY CRM WEBSITE ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THESE ITEMS AND SPECIFY THE OPTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO DO

(Unedited)","text":"<p>AS PART OF THE CONVERSION OF MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS I ALSO INSTALLED CIVI CRM AND SO SYMPATHY RM REQUIRES A CRON TASK OR A ROUTINE SCHEDULER THAT KICKS OFF VARIOUS MAINTENANCE PROCESSES WHETHER HOURLY OR DAILY AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE A SHELL SCRIPT AS WELL AS DOWNLOADED THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE TOOL THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO ALL OF THAT SO I'M GOING TO COVER THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS VIDEO WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO ONCE AGAIN SO HERE WE HAVE THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I CREATED FOR RUNNING CIVI CRM CRIME AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IN SUPER CRM YOU HAVE A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE PROCESSES THERE PREFER TO AS SCHEDULED TASKS AND THE SYSTEM EXCUSE ME SCHEDULED JOBS AND SO I'M GOING TO ADMINISTER SYSTEM SETTINGS AND SCHEDULED JOBS WILL BRING YOU TO THIS PAGE AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS TASKS SUCH AS CLEANING IT UP TEMPORARY DATA CHECKING FOR UPDATES CHECKING EMAILS WHETHER IT'S PROCESSING EMAILS OR FETCHING EMAILS THAT HAVE BOUNCED FROM YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SO THEY RUN AT VARIOUS INTERVALS AND IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CIVI CRM REQUIRES THAT YOU SET UP A TASK SCHEDULER OR A CRON JOB AND SO WHAT I DID WAS I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT THAT COULD BE DONE USING THE CIVI CRM COMMAND-LINE TOOL AND SO IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CIVI CRM WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS CV DOT FAR FILE OR CAR I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PH IS FAR FAR FAR AWAY AND SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN VARIOUS THINGS IN CIVI CRM AND PERFORM VARIOUS ACTIONS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE THE WP COMMAND LINE OR WORDPRESS COMMAND LINE INTERFACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO RUN IT AND IT GIVES YOU A NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO IF YOU RUN IT LIKE I JUST DID HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN PHP AND THEN PASS THE FILE NAME AS A ARGUMENT TO THE PHP CALL BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY A PHP SCRIPT OF SORTS AND SO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE YOU CAN MAKE CALL TO THE APIS YOU CAN CALL THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS HERE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RUN THE CRIME PROCESS AND SO I HAVE THAT POOL OF DUCK AND SO HERE IS THE SHELL SCRIPT THAT I HAVE IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION YOU CAN GO TO THE REPOSITORY FOR MY WEBSITE I HAVE A LINK TO THE POSIT OR E DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW AND YOU CAN MAKE A COPY OF THIS SCRIPT AND SO BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHECKS IT STARTS OFF WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THIS URL PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I GOT THE CONCEPT OF HOW TO BUILD THIS SCRIPT OUT BUT IT STARTS WITH THE CURRENT DATE AND THE REASON I PUT THE CURRENT DATE IN HERE IS SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN IT STARTED AND WHEN THEY END IT I'LL PROBABLY MAKE SOME MORE ADJUSTMENT TO THIS BEFORE ACTUALLY ROLLING IT OUT TO MY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ARGUMENT ONE IS NOT EMPTY AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE ARGUMENT 1 IS GOING TO BE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY OF WHERE THIS WHERE YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE WORDPRESS IS ON THE FILE SYSTEM IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO FROM THERE DOWN INTO THE FILE SYSTEM TO THE CIVIC CRM STUFF TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE NECESSARY COMMANDS THAT IT HAS TO RUN AND SO WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES IT JUST PRINTS OUT THE PATH THAT WAS PASSED IN AS ARGUMENT 1 TO THE SCRIPT AND THEN YOU CALL THEM PHP AND THEN THE CB DOT FARM FILE AND THEN THE NEXT PART IS YOU'RE MAKING AN API CALL TO DO JOB EXECUTE AND YOU WANT TO RUN THAT JOB EXECUTION AS USER CRON CIVI THIS USER WILL DEPEND ON HOW YOU HAVE YOUR SETUP BUT YOU NEED TO CREATE A USER ACCOUNT THAT WILL BE USED TO RUN THE CRON JOBS AND THEN YOU NEED TO SET THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE LOCATION THAT YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALL IS LOCATED ON THE FILESYSTEM AND SO IF YOU DON'T PASS IN THIS DOLLAR ONE IT THROWS AN ERROR BASICALLY SAYING YOU NEED TO RUN IT AND I ACTUALLY NEED TO UPDATE THE SCRIPT NAME BECAUSE I HAVE CHANGED IT BUT BASICALLY THE SCRIPT NAME AND THEN THE FOLDER ROOT WHERE FOLDER ROOT IS THE TOP LEVEL OF YOUR WORDPRESS PROJECT AND THEN THAT IS IT AND SO WHAT YOU DO RUN THIS AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND RUN IT FOR YOU NOW ALL RIGHT SO GOING TO DO DOT OR I CAN DO BASH EITHER WAY WORKS BECAUSE IT IS A BASH SCRIPT AND SO IS CIVI CRON EXCUSE ME CBC REM UNDERSCORE CRON DOT S H AND THEN I AM GOING TO DO THE PATH TO MY WORDPRESS DIRECTORY WHICH IT IS AND MY HOME AND SO I HIT ENTER AND YOU GET THIS OUTPUT AFTERWARDS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS THE START DATE AND TIME IT'S THE END DATE AND TIME THIS IS THE PATH LOCATION THAT I PASSED IN AND THIS SECTION RIGHT HERE IS THE JSON API RESPONSE THAT CIVI CRM HAS RETURNED BACK AND IF YOU GET A IS ERROR IS EQUAL TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN ZERO THAT MEANS SOMETHING DID NOT GO RIGHT AND YOU'LL NEED TO CHECK UP BE LOGS USUALLY IF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUTPUT THAN THESE LINES THAT IT DID RETURN THE LOG ERROR WILL SHOW UP IN CBC RM SO YOU COULD JUST LOG INTO SAVVY CRM AND LOOK IT'S THERE TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE SO THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THAT PART OF THINGS AND THEN THE LAST THING IS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO RUN THIS SHELL SCRIPT BEING A CRONTAB OR SCHEDULER TASK SO NOW I WILL COVER THAT PARTICULAR PART SO ON MY SYSTEM I HAVE CRONTAB SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN THAT UP AND AS YOU SEE I HAVE THE SECOND ITEM HERE WHICH RUNS THAT CIVICRM CRON SCRIPT AND I HAVE IT RUNNING EVERY 15 MINUTES HOWEVER IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IT RUN IN 15 MINUTES AT A MINIMUM I WOULD SUGGEST YOU RUN IT EVERY HOUR BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME HOURLY TASKS IN THERE THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED AND THAT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME OF TRAFFIC ON YOUR WEBSITE IF YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF VOLUME HOUR IS DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VOLUME YOU COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH 2 OR 3 OR EVEN 12 HOURS FOR THE FREQUENCY AND SO BASICALLY IT IS THE SAME COMMAND THAT I RAN SO I AM USING THE FULL PATH TO THE EXECUTABLES AND THE REASON BEING IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU START A CRON JOB DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM IT STARTS IN THE ROOT OF THE FILE SYSTEM IT MAY START IN THE HOME OF THE USER THAT IS RUNNING THAT CRON JOB IT ALL DEPENDS SO TO BE VERY EXPLICIT USE THE FULL PATH BECAUSE DEPEND ON WHERE IT STARTS IT MAY OR MAY NOT LOAD THAT RC FILE AND THE PATH VARIABLE WHICH WILL HAVE THE REFERENCE TO /BIN ALREADY POPULATED SO THAT'S WHY IN THE COMMAND LINE YOU CAN TYPE BASH AND IT KNOWS BIN BASH BUT IN CRON IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY LOAD THAT SO YOU IT'S BEST TO TYPE THE FULL THING SO IT'S NOT GUESSING AND SO GIVING THE FULL PATH TO THE SHOW SCRIPT AND THEN I'M GIVING THE FULL PATH TO THAT DIRECTORY AND THEN I AM OUTPUTTING ALL OF THE RESULTS FROM THE COMMAND THAT'S BEING RAN INTO A LOG FILE THAT IS IN MY HOME DIRECTORY AND THEN I'M COMBINING ANY ERRORS INTO THE STANDARD OUT AND ALL THAT GOES INTO THAT SAME LOG FILE THAT WAY I DON'T HAVE TWO FILES THAT I HAVE TO CHECK IT'S EVERYTHING IS IN ONE FILE AND IT'S IN THE ORDER THAT IT OCCURRED AND SO I WILL ALSO SHOW YOU THIS LONG VOWEL SO GO HERE AND DO CATS BECAUSE THE CONTENTS ARE NOT THAT LONG AND SO HERE YOU SEE WE HAVE THE SAME THING FROM WHEN I RAN IT ON THE COMMAND LINE DATE THE PATH AND THE JSON RESPONSE AND THEN THE END DATE AND TIME SO THAT WILL WRAP IT UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO IF YOU NEED HELP SETTING UP YOUR CRON JOB ON CBC RM FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER YOU CAN ALSO REACH OUT DOWN BELOW BY LEAVING A COMMENT WITH WHATEVER ISSUE THAT YOU'RE HAVING AND I'LL BE SURE TO RESPOND BACK TO YOU WITH ANY ADVICE OR SUGGESTIONS THAT I CAN OFFER ALSO FEEL FREE THAT IF THIS VIDEO HAS HELPED YOU GIVE IT A THUMBS UP AND YOU CAN CHECK OUT MY WEBSITE BE ALMOST ENGINEER CALM WHERE I'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS AND

Thus I had to make modifications to the code that provided in the two examples above.</p> <p>I was able to accomplish the needed output with almost the same amount of commands as the 24-hour clock. However, the commands did have to be modified. For the PM times, I changed the loop to go from 13 to 23 for the option values and to use the same, but subtract 12 from each of the display values. For the AM times, I did have to the time with the leading zero so that it would align with the value being returned from the database.

(Unedited)","text":"<p>welcome back i am continuing the process of the update on the website and i know you're probably thinking like how many parts this is going to be well it's going to be a is it it may end up being a lot of parts and the reason being because i want you to be able to watch this in smaller segments instead of trying to do the entire project in one large long video um that way it's easier to you know stay track and pick up on things and so forth you know so you can take breaks in between kind of like how i am taking breaks in between and recording each of these video segments where we last left off we did some updating on the carousel and put some images in so i've copied some more images over to this repository i've also made some changes to the footer and i figured it would be a little bit better to have this the same color we're going to make some additional changes to the footer though on video so that you can see those how you transition from this format to a different format without further ado we'll go ahead and get into it welcome back to the almost engineer channel if this is your first time checking out this channel please be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button below each week i come with new videos and discuss how to do technology on tuesday and how to do diy projects on saturday so if you're interested in those topics be sure to subscribe this week is a special week because it is engineering week and so as part of engineering week i am actually doing my national society of black engineers website over during this week and i'm doing it as a coding session so that hopefully you the viewer can learn something new about programming when it comes to website design or just how to code whether css html or bootstrap even so picking up where we left off i did make some changes to the footer in the previous video this was black in the background and i've changed it to the same color as the nav bar because i saw some designs that were set up that had the nav bar and this bottom footer the same color so next what i'm gonna do is actually change this from a single color layout that goes all the way across the screen to a four column layout i'm not sure how that's going to work with this banner here but we'll go ahead and convert it and then figure out the banner part at a later point so i'm going to go ahead and go down to the bottom where my footer is all right so here's the footer and in visual studio code you can actually put breakpoints here i think there's another way you can actually do a bookmark but i'm not sure how to do bookmarks in here so breakpoints help out because ebbs you wear keep track of your points in the various places in the file and what i'm going to do is actually can change this container to a we're going to go with a row and i believe that padding there and i believe that twitter class there but i'm gonna change this to a row and then on the next section i'm going to do all of that with a column of uh for anything that is a large screen or above it'll be a column of three otherwise uh calls i think it's sm will be 12 and yes so that's how i want that i'm going to remove the horizontal line and put that back and then we're going to do the same thing for the remainder of these divs and we'll also need to add an additional div and remove the footer excuse me remove the uh remove these additional containers because the parent container will address everything else that i'm doing in here and so uh so i need to put one here and i need to add one more i believe or do i have four on this page let's see so i have one two three four so i need to put this into a footer and i'll probably leave this copyright down here at the very bottom but put these links off to the side in a vertical lock if you will all right so the last item this will actually need to go into a div because it does not currently exist in one or yes it does well the whole thing doesn't so right so do a uh div here and remove that so-called intelligence from intellisense trying to figure out what i want to type all right and we'll close the existing div that's above and so that should if i remove these horizontal rows and let's see all right so that should be it let me go ahead and do the formatting on here to make sure my indentations are correct and it looks like i might be missing a div somewhere but let's go to the page and check it out just to make sure all right so everything is in a single uh well that's not in there all right um we got div container and we want this all right so we know this is the closing container i need to move this one and a corresponding div and this one with the corresponding div out of the way if you do format let's see how that lines up it does not line up for well yeah it does okay let's move this down here i think that might be correct all right so we got uh the four cards within there and they are set up correctly i know they're not centered like they should so let me do a margin of x auto hopefully that'll center there we go all right and this one is outside of the car like i say we'll address that in a little bit and then the last thing is i want to put these links up here i also need to change the anchor text for hover event to be some other kind of color or just to stay white whichever the case may be so what i'm gonna do is go ahead and copy the existing copy the existing card here and i'm gonna restructure these links here and um comment that one out do i need card text card text card text art text so actually i do need this one and i'm gonna change this to links and then card text i'm going to leave that paragraph there i'm going to copy these unordered lists and put those inside of the paragraph and well maybe not put them in a paragraph let's see how they do without being in the paragraph going to go current um that out all right so what do we have okay so we have some links over here which look good like i say this will be corrected and i actually need to remove those down at the bottom here so we'll take this entire div comment it out uh let's uncomment this one first and then i comment that or comment that rather okay so now we have what we're looking for and this footer with the copyright in it i guess that looks fine might need to change the footer up here uh class footer so it's probably something in the css i think that's what i said um in the pre in an earlier video where there was a margin yeah padding and margin at the bottom so we'll comment those two out for now and so that should be uh save it yeah so that should be closer to the bottom i think i need to run the minify okay if not that's fine all right now the next thing is to so i like this particular setup right here i may want to take this border off of the cars or put some margin in between each of these and to do that let's go back to base and i want to do a m x of 1 that's a margin on the x axis of one all right and so what i have to do is actually so when you do a column of three and you have four of them then when you try to put margin in what happens is one of those columns get kicked to the next row which is not what i want so what i'm gonna do is actually change some of these to a column of two and remember all of your columns are supposed to add up to a total of twelve so two two two well actually we'll leave that one as a four and then i'm gonna leave that one as a three and i know you're thinking 4 2 and 2 is 4 plus 4 is 8 plus 3 is 11 that is not 12. and that is correct and the reason being is because i want them to be on the same line here but also want to have possibly a little bit of margin in between and that may be a problem so i may end up having to take this margin out let's see what happens if i put padding here instead okay and padding may be the way that i end up going i i'm kind of hesitant at this point so let's take that out okay and so i have a three all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to change this last column so that column is three the amazon is four i need another one so we'll set this donations one two three and okay so that looks fine not really so three and three so three and three is six plus no yeah three and three is six plus four is ten plus 2 is 12. not sure if i want to leave it that way i may make the links a 2 and make the join today a 3 so let's give that a go so links can become a two that way all the links are in a single column and then these others are in a wider column which is fine and then i'll probably separate these links out um that's what i'm thinking maybe maybe not if you have any questions about this design drop a comment down below um i would love to hear whether you think these should be wider or narrower that's a difficult word to say narrower um but yeah especially with these because these links actually have multiple are broken across multiple lines so while i'm at it let me go ahead and change the css for these so the footer [Music] what is it something that turns red the default text is a hover event all right so we have the footer line yeah so here we go so the photo links don't need to do that so on hover i'm going to do a font weight of bold on those and so when you mouse over now they kind of jump up and i think that's better that may work for now i may change it again later on but for right now i think this does the job cool all right now this banner here i think i might just get rid of it all together and we just put something here that is slightly different um trying to find that code for that better which is so that's the page here we go we got the blocks or did i wait a minute where's the bookmark at there we go okay so and see again this is where bookmarks come handy you can just look for the bookmark you see it over here on the left but it's not so much as evident on the right as it is on the left um in some i believe is visual studio it actually will make a when you have break points on the left-hand side it will actually show them on the scroll bar as well on the right-hand side so it's a little bit easier to identify but this here only has them showing on the left so you kind of have to scroll i do believe there's an option or there may be an option you um i guess not sometimes there is an option let's see jump to breakpoint uh so you got enable audit point there you go so go to the next break point so that kind of helps uh if you're by just stepping through the code and as you see it jumps down there um so that when you're doing debugging you can utilize that all right coming back to what we were working on um so right now i'm going to [Music] so what i'm going to do is change this right now because i don't like that banner and at some point i have to log in and get the things for that banner to be able to officially do it a different way what i'm going to do is go what i am going to go ahead and do now though is to put a plain text uh banner here that represents that same piece of information for amazon and while this may not be the best way of doing it it will work now and maybe i'll take this javascript that they have as well as this iframe and give it a page by itself on the website that way the site will still blend in together but then for the amazon small it has its own page and we can refer to that page directly in our promotional items and so forth to uh that way you know people don't necessarily have to go to the site they can well they can go to the site still but then they can use that as a place to jump to a different page very quickly without having to go through multiple steps to get to it because that was one of the complaints that i had uh received about how like you got to go to our site to get to that every time and originally yeah that was the case unfortunately that's how i was set up but i there's a different way that that can be done now so amazon smile all right so there's that and if i go back to our current sites um got it all right so uh shop and i'll change this so since we have this here i can actually go back and change this to all of these to threes and or maybe even yeah so i think i can change all of these to threes and so they're equal now we'll get each of these on a line these links that is on a line by itself may even put in the bullet points as well not sure why that careers link is not showing up on the line by itself that is kind of oh well okay that makes sense because it's listing each item as an inline item which it i don't want it to now so go ahead and take those inline item text out save so now each link is being displayed there and broken the cm css board which is uh slightly inconvenient but that's fine um and i'll come back and do that one later okay so amazon smile is here i need to figure out some text to go on the amazon smile thing so i'm just going to say if you job with amazon um please consider using for your purchase and all right that fills that text in i'll go back and re-agree to define it and clarify it at a later point but that's enough to at least get started for right now and then uh i guess i can go ahead and take that page content so this right here and um well first let me uncomment it and then go ahead and copy it out and create a new page in the not the theme so we want that in the sites directory and call it um i want a separate page all right so we can do that here so i'm gonna just do it here if i think it needs to go on a separate page i might give his home page but for now this will work and there we go all right so and i think i want to put this amazon smile thing up here first granite we get more from directly from direct donations over amazon smile but i think a lot of people will be more inclined because of the fact they're using uh they're using this information to purchase then go from there and actually i'm probably going to reorder this because i want this donations text to be up here this is what we do with the donations we provide them use them into other programs so scholarships community awareness and outreach such as our engineering day at the park um yeah so go ahead and save that and [Applause] save the page itself and so if i go to the what is it donate yes go to the donate page the amazon smile thing is there got to figure out how to get rid of that white space but for right now it is fine since i am still testing things out i'm not too alarmed about it but long term this will move up or we even have a different banner here going back to the amazon smile thing let's go and in the base need to add where is that link um so amazon smile so just copy what they have here and and so this particular set of text was provided from the template so i'm just copy that and do donate with a pound sign of amazon smile in here and that will all right so with that this will take you to the donate page as well as jump down to this section of the page so to demonstrate that let's go back to the homepage and scroll down past all this text and hit shop today and there we go we jump down to the bottom where it says amazon smile all right next let's go and fix the css for the links over here on the right hand side so that will be in the what i take out the left nav item list item i think that was this you know footer yeah so i took out this class but that should address that problem i think okay so it is bolding so i need to do also um the ul footer i don't need the hover event i need the other pieces of the event here we go all right so now my links are again white so that's what i want next i need to go back and fix the links at the top part of the page that have this class this class needs to be removed is there a more efficient way of doing this yes you can do find and replace and in that find and replace you can do [Music] for it to search only the selection and then do a find and replace based on that selection um but i didn't do that in this particular scenario as you saw uh it's not that many items and sometimes crafting that uh find and replace expression it takes a little bit longer than just going through and doing each line that way all right so we have our bottom section here of our top section there and there we go all right any point i could change this to black but i chose to go with the red it seems to be a little bit more of a subtle color and i may even just change this back to black though who knows all right so we have all of that there let me go ahead and change these to buttons i think it would give a better visual appearance if they were buttons so we just do a btn on the not that that's the wrong button a button as far as each of those because it i think it will look better that way but if it doesn't um it can easily be undone if you think it would look better with buttons feel free to drop a comment to say yes or no and in addition to the buttons i need to also do a class that corresponds to said buttons because i want the buttons to stand out and so if i have let's say btn and then btn footer there we go and then we'll do another class btn footer with a background color that is black and text color that is white semicolon all right and i need a border around this thing so border with um gotta type it right we'll go with uh 1px and order color and we'll do black save all right so we got that and then there's another thing i thought it was the background color but i guess it's not um let's see if i can do this so btn dark let's see what happens uh oh okay so on mouse over it's working not quite want it to look like this without having to be moused over and so let me see what other attributes it is setting bottom border which is fine left border top color i don't know what's doing so how about this let's disable the css for the moment and see how it looks once it or if it'll refresh all right so button start okay so it does that right now if i wanted it so the background color is dark red i think that's because the css for that is telling it to be that way overwriting it's not an inline style but if i do an inline style it would overwrite so i need um btn footer uh yeah let's just stick with btn footer re-enable that and yeah there we go i want the text to still be white so i have a hover event that is changing that text to black not sure where is that on hover on hover on hover vtn homepage so we got a black with a body div dope footer footer photo photo sub footer um the background color is dark red ah so here we go i think that does that have cart link on it yes it does all right so let's take this out and see what happens once it okay so stop today has btn and btn footer um and the footer is defaulting to white well that's just a general um [Music] all right so let's do inspect element on this item we got div card body let's see if there's a card body in here spelling helps no okay so the styles that is inheriting so you gotta border background color i want the background color to be uh if we can change that one two three all right so a b t n i'm trying to see where is btn ah there we go all right so black text is white there we go now on hover or a um and i may have to narrow this down a little bit because that is not doing exactly how i want all right so btn footer so let's do a dot btn dot footer all right and change this abtn back to dark red and save okay and so now that is more specific to what will show up here and this and that's what i want all right so coming back to the base uh template going to change all the class cards or class excuse me change the class on all of the links over to btn btn footer and that's what we want we want these buttons to kind of or we want the links to appear as buttons and that they stand out and so when click they still go there which is cool all right so close the dev console and make sure all the links are working as it should be which they are um maybe want to add a little bit of flair to that where here so let's do a card title so we can extend the card title i don't think there's one already in here title no good all right so we do card title and div dot card title with a text uh decoration of underline and it did not do what i thought it was going to do all right so what other classes do we need to add to make this possible so i did a div i don't think i need to do a div let's come back so there's really a h5 not a div that explains why that didn't work all right and so now we have that there and i really don't want that just on that part so i may go with a border bottom of 1px or 3px and then border style of solid all right and um border bottom style i'll play that century there we go and so now we have our length uh line that goes all the way across the bottom here and um i would say that's pretty decent for the bottom um close dev console i may want to let's get rid of this border that is around the card so coming back to the css i want to do card and set the order width to zero so i'm going to do div dot card border width width spelling okay 0px and save all right and so now we have cards for each of these as you see there is no border here and if you really can't see i'll zoom in so now you see there's no border also when we get to a certain size that the divs go from side by side to stacked on top of each other which is the behavior that we want all right and i'm probably going to put another i put a horizontal rule down here at the very bottom to separate the bottom of the page that copyright information out so come back here and the copyright information is down here so we want a let's just do a hr i could do a border in in that div but hr should be sufficient hr by the way stands for horizontal rule and that needs a class with a background color of white all right and so there you see we have that stretched all the way across and so we are good to go on that aspect of things okay next step or next item i have some pictures brought in and they are sitting waiting to be leveraged so what i want to do is to fill some of these pages such as the membership page that i was on previously up with some content and to also work on some of the other pages i think i had a scholarships page yes and so i'm going to put the picture that we have from previous scholarship years up so that people i guess you could say no that is real and they can see some of the scholarship recipients and i'm not sure which photo is which um i could actually pull up these images in visual studio code if we do a refresh on that directory and here we go all right so and i loaded several images in here because i want to be able to do this so this is one of the community programs that we did we had a number of people here myself back here in the very back and of course my traffic light all the way up here in the front on display um so i'm not sure which of these may use let's see when load the image that's convenient uh that's myself with some other gentlemen who are also in nsbe or where at least when they were in college all right so we'll go with this particular photo here and so this will be a community outreach photo and if you go to programs i want to put this photo on the top of this page so from the previous video we talked about uh having alts yeah having things that uh images on here and using that in the metadata uh photo with participants t-i-c-i-p-a-n-t-s all right so we come back to the programs page so i should have okay so i have a bad link here that's not what i wanted oh images is plural save all right and so what i'm gonna have to do is to go to my css and i'm gonna ultimately have to resize this image because as you see it is super large um it was that's the original file so i'm gonna have to resize this for the web but as a quick and dirty way of doing this uh what i'm going to do is to want to create a uh class some create a class for image and we call uh head image all right and we'll save that and then we'll come back over to the css file and do dot uh head image age parentheses and do a width of um let's say 100 i think that's what it's supposed to be and height of auto i think that's how you would get that to resize yes so what will happen is what it's doing now because i put this css here is that it's saying take 100 of the width of the page i mean excuse me 100 of the parent container and then the height being auto means that this image will resize itself to fit that same space so for instance let's say the width of the screen is 500 pixels and so it will resize the height based upon that and so when you resize it like this right here to that nine through the smaller space the image will automatically resize and will not get cut off that's how you avoid getting that right hand scroll bar now ultimately i'm gonna resize this again so that it's not as high resolution because if we do the image info this is 4 000 by 2 000 approximately pixels which is a pretty large file for the web and as you see is scaled down to 1080 by 608 all right so um just keep that in mind but i wanted this particular photo here because it does relate to some of the community outreach programs that we do and the participation that we've had in doing some of the things that we do here um so now that i've got that one there we'll come back over here to the abouts and that's kind of scaled incorrectly too and i maybe i may have to just do this one individually and when it comes to scaling uh these particular set of images and uh maybe there's a different way of doing that so i auto maybe i'll just do height auto and with auto and let's see what happens then all right so that resizes itself accordingly this one is still too large there's a way to do it so that it fits um so actually come think of it so let's do a max width of 100 that's what i'm thinking and so that will fit there and then if we go back to the about there we go so that resized accordingly to the way it should be so that way you don't have these ultra large images stretching beyond the screen and so again max width will make sure that it doesn't extend beyond the container that it's in and this is in particular two images so what i really can do is actually do image img dot head image so that i know that that's specific to images all right um coming over to the membership page i do have another photo that i would like to use and the goal is to not use the same set of photos over and over again um and then the ones i do not need i will take out uh let's see okay that's a lot of the same photo all right so here's one that we do for our toy donation that we do all right so this one is the one that i want to do for the scholarship so because this is the scholarship banquet that we had some years ago and let's go back to let's go to the scholarship page and then we'll put in image url of slash images with the file name and i notice this is uppercase so let me fix that right quick because while some sys like if you're your server if your website is hosted on a windows space system it will not make a big deal if that file name is uppercase or lowercase but on a linux based system it will make all of the world of difference if that is not done correctly all right so the image alternate tab tag rather is the scholarship recipients um scholarship recipient spell check does not help that's the thing s-c-h-o-l-a-r all right so that's there all right so now if we come back to [Music] if we go to scholarship so we go to programs and scholarship boom we have an image that is fairly again fairly large but it can be resized a little bit better i can actually set the max width so let me go to the css i'm going to set the max width to 75 with the height of auto and so that's a little bit more realistic and where it should be i mean you can even go down even further to as fifty percent of the max width of the screen of that transparent container and to get this a little bit smaller but i'm okay with 75 percent depending on some of the other images i may need to adjust it accordingly and this is kind of similar as well as far as that percentage goes alright so that photo looks great and i need one for the membership i think i have enough uh photos six eight i use that there uh three six one that's a different one okay so maybe i need to go copy a few more photos because i think i might be missing some from somewhere all right uh yeah so go back to programs right quick and we do have some engineering photos i think i actually downloaded some hold on i did download some here i believe this is one i just need to copy it over okay so there we go all right so this is another one i actually just need to move them over to the appropriate directory because i forgot about those so copy and open containing folder because easier to go back alright copy images paste there we go all right so now that we have those two images in here we can come back over here and refresh and make sure that they work so use this path um that's a very long file name that's what happens when you download images from that particular social media site that starts with f i'm not gonna call the name because they may be listening but we can rename that at a later time uh let's see we have membership programs scholarship engineering day ah okay so what i want to do i need to go find a few more images but what i want to do is also add some images to this carousel which is what i previously mentioned in the last video so we'll come back up to the carousel and i need to get this image off the clipboard so i don't erase it all right so i'm just going to copy a carousel item well before i do that let me go up here and i'm gonna add some slides so i got zero one two three and four all right and yes that's good all right so we got a div and we need to go from that div to i believe is this one or the next the next one okay i think that's correct save all right and we'll run well probably don't want to run the formatting on it just yet all right so copy that and i'm going to remove that paste and i'm going to check to make sure it didn't break anything in process okay so the image is there and i got a couple of i got one more or two more that probably want to drop in so that's that one that is a i guess i can use this one on the membership page granted all the people in that particular photo are not members but majority of the people in that photo are members so image url and do slash images slash that dot jpg and image alt um uh members uh that's all right so there goes that and so if you have that here boom so cool for as the images go [Music] all right that needs to really be a h3 tag so since i'm here change that to an h3 uh all right now back to the carousel i think i had a cup one more or two more photos not that one this one yes all right so we'll put uh that down here and then there's another photo that's it [Music] yeah that's it so we'll go with this one and put that one down here as well and we come back to the carousel item and scroll down to the div there copy paste and paste and we'll take this file here paste it there and take this one here and paste it there and save and now i think i have all of the carousel items correct all right so like a mist type the jpg is it lowercase jpg and so this is what i was talking about when you go and do file names and the file names are either lowercase or uppercase and they don't quite match that you have that problem looks like the url is correct 12 54 17 jpg saying that the file might be corrupt which is weird um because it just got through showing it so i'm not sure how it's coming to the conclusion that is corrupt all right so that's what i copied that one works that was worse okay um so save again and see images images got it all right so scroll through scroll through woo that is massively large and then that one doesn't work okay how convenient all right so the width is auto and the height is 100 uh percent of the parent and looks like i'm missing the image all right so we got how many so let's collapse okay i don't want to collapse that one two three four five six okay so i got one too many images up here let me take this last one out and save so i got one two three four five and the number of images you have needs to correspond to the number of indicators on your carousel otherwise you're going to get a carousel image that doesn't have well it's going to scroll to the carousel item that doesn't have a corresponding image which will be a problem uh looks like i might be missing a something on a div somewhere not fully sure all right so let's take one of these out see i think that's correct all right so if i do that and three four and it should glitch which it's doing that's fine with me all right so this image i probably don't maybe i don't need to use that particular image um all right so let's put that there well that's the same fault how convenient 5459 okay so let's try this one instead all right and with that there that should work carousel next and first okay okay there we go all right so one two three four five i think this because this image is so large it's not really sure how to handle it which i don't quite agree with why it's not sure with how to handle it um so let's do this let's take well that styling probably doesn't need to be in line i think i need to put a class there instead so let me do a style on this last one so let's do a style uh but that's not going like that can i do that nope doesn't like it got it all right so we'll just cut it put it on the line by itself comment and then do a class of head image it's what i use technically i'm not trying to use this on this line but trying to see if it will actually make a difference and make this fit or not and it doesn't look like it will make it fit um which is fairly weird that it wouldn't want to fit there so let's uh we'll go ahead and do style equal width of 100 percent and heights is auto for this and see what happens with that particular image okay so it's a little bit better uh than what it was before still not scaling the way that i would like it to 75 on that one and see what happens a little bit i'm not sure why still trying to scale because it's supposed to scale to let's take this one out it's supposed to scale to the parent container which is still not there okay and i might just have to just ultimately resize this image all together to 50. all right go back okay so now i have the whole image but i'm not sure why it's not trying to fit to this container here um usually that doesn't happen or at least in my experience it doesn't happen but uh yeah there's that at least it is scrolling all of the other images and they're fitting for the most part let's view this image so okay so the bottom part of this one is also being cut off i didn't realize that um so if we go back so you see here the desk and the floor are not seen in this part and i may need to make some alignment adjustments to this particular photo so i'm actually probably going to do a text was it text line center on that one and see if it moves it up or not okay so it didn't move it up a little bit tricky to deal with but uh yeah we'll go with that for now and so actually i did the wrong image or did i okay so we're going to change i think i did do the wrong image and yeah so let's trace this to about 60 of the width and height auto and if we come back so 60 percent is still within reason for that so all of the images are now looking fairly good in my opinion okay that being said i'm going to do some cleanup here so don't need these h1s anymore worst case scenario go back and copy them out of their respective templates so i'm going to leave that div there in case some text does need to be put in in the future but as you see right now i really don't need that all right so there's that there's that whoops three and all right and i know i mentioned in a previous video that sometimes i leave code in like commented out until the very end as i just absolutely certain that i'm not going to use it but this i know i'm not going to use so i'm just going to go ahead and remove all of this out so again at any point that you're watching this video you know or even after you get done watching this video feel free to drop any comments that you may have or any questions about how i am doing things in here and so once you remove all your comedy code make sure you haven't broken anything in a process because yes while the code is commented out sometimes you actually can break stuff in the process and that's not a good thing so all right so we have our images up here at the top and we have membership has a photo programs as a photo the events pops to another site photos i probably get another image there and then we have this uh city image here and we're going to get officers listed as well as their positions i'm going to do that later i may or may not do that particular part on camera so continuing on the next item i want to work on is the home page so what i did was look at some of the other chapters websites and they do have the these header items here that i commented out so i'm just going to go ahead and restore this particular set of items and go ahead and fill it in so let me go ahead and format this section here or format the document um it may have formatted the entire section though and i think i don't have a corresponding item all right so and i have a container at the top i believe no i don't so um [Music] so this does not need to be in the co well yes it does okay so i only want these heading i guess they call them featurettes or something of that nature you only want those on the home page so i'm going to extend my if condition for my carousel the image thing that at the top of the home page so this thing here is called the carousel so i'm going to extend that or loop include this part of the uh header thing to only show when this down here is not showing as well and [Music] then yeah we'll leave it at that and so for the page body of the index home page i don't need any content so what i'm going to do is to say adios to everything in here delete save and so all of this text down here the bottom should disappear which it has and then all i have now is the headings that are hardcoded into the page which is what i want all right so let's do another formatting of the document to make sure everything is in alignment and it looks like it may or may not be i think i actually don't have i need a closing div for that container slash div all right and so now i have to do a format i think that's correct now yes and all right so i want to highlight certain aspects of the website in this heading section and to do that i'm just going to pick out various things so one of our signature programs is engineering in the park we call it e day at the park all right so i typed that in and looking at it making sure that it actually fits in this space looks good the other thing i want to do is ask people to join so that will be the left block and then on the right hand side i think i'm going to go with programs all right and there we go so we have drawing either at the park and programs should be plural not singular looks like we might have caught it there we go all right and so next we'll have the links so this will go to the programs page plural this will go to the eday page and this will go to the membership page and we'll need to put the leading slash on there all right and so if we test these out they go to the membership page which is correct go to the e-day page which is correct and goes to the program page which is also correct and then i got to figure out some text to drop in i may just do like some preview text so we already have some text here i may just take this copy it and for this particular paragraph drop that in paste and obviously it doesn't like that long line format and let it wrap on its own and there you have it for yes so whoops no not down here here we go right here all right and so i'm gonna put a end container tag of uh and headings and that way as i scroll through this template because this template is fairly long um it's 450 lines exact and that is because of some of the comments are still in here and so forth but i still want to be able to scroll through and be able to find like the beginning and ending of the divs and not have to be like tracing like i've kind of been doing as you've seen me do so this is a little bit easier way just to put a comment there at the end of it and the same thing with like your closing conditions so like for instance at the top of this file here i have several uh conditions here so like this one so for instance this meta tag so at the end of this one i could actually do this in title condition or something like that nature and that helps you be able to find uh that in the file so when you're scrolling through you know if you have five or ten conditions in there that you're looking for it helps you find that ending fairly quickly so you know where to start from and where to scroll back up to all right so i did that for that one let's copy the text for engineering date at the park and i'm gonna just put this here at some point i probably will go back and refine this set of text not while on camera though uh because you know sometimes you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to put here and it's still not come out right all right so and i like when i have paragraphs i like the text in the paragraph to be on its own line that way when i start if i were to add like classes those classes could take up this entire line you know depending on how many you put in here i know some people they rather have their paragraph as concise as possible but i am not necessarily that way readability of the code is more important to me than being concise but there are different schools of thought on that so think about it as you may all right so for this last thing uh we'll go ahead and copy and paste and i'm actually have to change the text i don't know if you actually read it before i saw complete all of these steps listed on the membership page all right and so if you come back here to the home page now all right so we have joined asby we have programs and i'm gonna like i say redef refine these paragraphs here um and also try to make a little bit more even than what they currently are and there's that okay and so uh yeah this is coming out pretty well i did not need to click that page all right so so far so good like i say depending on the feedback i get from the other members in the chapter this color scheme may change as it stands right now i'm sticking with this dark red but it may change to black um at you know a later point so if you're checking this at some point in the future after this video has already been released just know that it may change from the way it looks now and so when you look at it don't be like hey he's got red in the video but black in actuality or green in actuality and that is probably going to be the reason why so just keep that in mind all right so that will wrap things up for this video series um as you see i've taken if you have not seen the other videos in the series a link will be in the description below uh starting from the beginning to the end this you know has been a very week uh education for me because uh in some of the other videos i actually learned how to do things myself for some of the css items that i was not familiar with so it's kind of surprising but you know as i'm teaching others the good thing about it is when you teach others you also learn something yourself um so you're able to even further that advancement of the knowledge that you have to other people so any questions drop those down in the comments section below if you have learned anything from this video series i ask that you please give this video and the other videos in the series a thumbs up if you have any questions comments if you don't want to put your question in a comment shoot me a message on instagram or twitter at almost engr the handle is up in the upper right of your screen i do respond to messages that i receive i do reply back to the comments that are posted so it may take some time for me to do it but i do see it and i do respond alright until next time peace out and hopefully you have a good engineers week </p>"},{"location":"technology/2021.02.26-website-coding-day-6%2C-engineers-week-2021/","title":"Website Coding Day 6, Engineers Week

(Unedited)","text":"<p>i have the contact form created and the only way to access it is to click down here at the bottom i also have some links within the pages themselves that will have a link to the contact page so i want to show you how i'm about to do this form now i could put the email form in the markdown file but i don't want to do that because i tried my best to avoid having html in the markdown file i've done this here but when it comes to an entire form that is a lot of content to have in there so what i'm going to do is actually kind of copy some existing code that i already have and so on my website what i did was normally you cannot submit with a static website submit data so uh and that's kind of a bigger problem because there you have to have some kind of server side processor that will have the ability to be able to handle the data that is being passed to it so what i have done was on my website i created a php file and this is it so i'm just going to go ahead and copy it as is and put it in over here so again i talked about in an earlier video about reusing code that you've already written nothing is wrong with that some people frown upon it but i enjoy it because hey it saves me time like literally i am not having to write this over again and uh visual studio code is trying to be intelligent right there with all of that but i have no um no need to try to fill all of that out all right so what i've done is i've actually copied this code and what it does is you're basically checking to see if a value is set and if it is set you're going to take all the content that is in that form and so here we go so it's a post array and you will literally split that array out into the message body of the email and then you will add the date time to that email as well as uh the service type which i'm gonna have to change to customize to this form with the current time and then the headers which is the from address and then i have a helpdesk email which is a variable that is being sourced from the environment variables which i will show you how to do that here shortly i do not put my environment variables in the version controls it's just a file that sits on the server in production and then a different file that sits in development so it's kind of like a i treat it like a configuration file and that way it's not ever committed to the code base that way i'm not sending emails when i'm trying to test my code i'm not sending those emails from my development environment to actual email addresses that would be bad um so by making this environment file uh that works there so basically you got the helpdesk email which i have an email dedicated to a dedicated email address in production for my particular website on this one it will be a email that is dedicated to the organization kind of a generic email and then that email has forwarding built into it so that you send it to one address and then that one address forwards it to i think it's like four or five different of the executive uh officers of the chapter so uh pretty much want to level that setup and if the mail was successful then redirect to what is a submission page if not then you do a unexpected error and fail out and then if somebody tries to come to this page directly then it redirects back to the home page by default that being said all right so i have my submit.php and so what i'm going to do is to add a condition in here that will check to see if we are on the con contact not contract contact page so if page.url is equal to contact i believe that's how that's set up with the there and then i also want to do a else and then so if we're not on the contact page show the page content if we are on the contact page show this particular form that i am about to code out format all right there we go so that being said you want to have you want to have some information in here let's see you want to have the form in here so that uh it shows only on that page okay so do form and we're going to have the method of post and the action will post to the submit php page that we just created and close that form out cool now i recommend having recaptcha on your forms i'm not going to cover how to do that or i may come at a later point and cover how to do that but uh recapture basically you go into google then you do a search for google recaptcha and they give you a key and token and so forth and then you copy the text the copy what they give you to paste it on your page and that verifies it somehow magically hooks i think with the use of shell script i mean cell scripts javascript it will hook into your form and so basically if the recaptcha is not completed then your form is not allowed to be submitted so that's a you know helpful way to prevent from getting spam all right so pretty much i'm going to replicate what is already here on the current form that we use on the website and so go ahead and start out trying to see let me look at the source for this particular page um curious on how this was set up now mind you this is a drupal form and so uh the drupal way of doing things may not be the most efficient way of doing things but it is here nonetheless okay so they have a form id with the method of posts and the form post back to itself and then it looks like each element or each field on the form is contained within a div and they have a label as well as a input for each of those items so that is very doable here so we'll do a label and we'll do a label for and the uh we'll call it uh requester name i try not to use keywords in my labeling or uh attributes if you will of the page so that's where that comes from all right and so we'll call it name and the next one we'll do an input of type text and once you have it with a placeholder it says enter your name there we go and this field is going to be required and i know some people they just like to do the single attribute so they'll type required like that personally i hate this because when you look at it if you're just scanning and looking at the attributes it looks like this particular attribute does not have a value associated so what i usually do is required equals required and i know that's like well but that's that is valid html um believe it or not so when there is a attribute that has that really doesn't have a value usually the attribute is also the same thing as that value so required equals required and um i think there's a yeah mainly so instead of just people just typing two or three letters for the sake of this you should want to try to get them to type their full first and last name in here so i'm gonna set the min link to four and so that way if they try to type it in and it doesn't uh it should not pass for that reason all right so i also want to include the form control on this particular form and the reason being is because the form control provides some css styling that is built into bootstrap and so i want to be able to leverage that i also need to set a name in here and i probably need to wrap this on the well probably wrap itself so set the name to request their name on this and i mean you could just set this name set the label for equal to name and then name equals name but that in my opinion looks rather weird so i tried to avoid those type of setups i know some people they don't mind it nor do they care they're more concerned with if it works it works and i shouldn't be concerned with what it actually says but you really should be concerned with what it actually says all right so the next one is the email field we're going to change this to email address likewise email address and i don't know what i just did there email address the type is email and yes that is a valid type enter your email address that field is required and a main length let's see is really a one two so even if you had a at b dot c a at b dot c so it's at least five characters so we're gonna set that to five that way the forum won't just be submitted um it'll probably be a pain for some people that are just trying to get through this form really quickly but we're really trying to reduce the amount of spam submissions that are being submitted so uh that's how you do that you set them in link all right so phone call is what i'm gonna call this instead of phone number um because some spam box can figure out these things so or uh actually we'll have a little bit of fun here so i'm gonna name this field call tyrone and the label is actually going to be phone number and we're going to call tyrone oh type equals phone i think there's a type uh is there a type of telephone so let's see uh input field types phone number all right so for phone number you have a telephone type and hey well why not just go ahead and copy this piece of snippet here i didn't there we go all right so paste use that pattern and that pattern is a regular expression um depending on where you're at that may or may not work uh so just a placeholder and do it five five five five five five five five all right um we'll set this to required uh and then length is uh let's see that is ten digit phone number with two extra characters so a min length of 12 and close that out in that div so div class form control and we have another which i'll go ahead and copy copy paste say form control and if you come back to here we have subjects i don't really think we i mean short summary may be helpful but i think i'm gonna go ahead and inject my own summary here uh when the form processor so i'm actually going to do this last one as message comment or question not request and we'll do this as message and actually probably want to do this as a i believe that is a text area not a input yes it is all right so we're going to cancel that i mean not cancel comment that for the moment so text area and name is message and let's see what we have so we have 5 rows in 60 columns and the placeholder is messaged with the name and required okay all right so we'll do uh required is equal to required no not requester required there we go all right name rows is five columns we'll stick with uh well we're not gonna specify the columns we'll see how that plays out without that piece of information being present and let's see placeholder uh enter your message text all right so if we come back and refresh the page we do not have the page body and it's probably because of this url all right so there we go all right so we have our page body it looks weird because well it is weird nonetheless all right need to see where things may be going a little funky with this um so we have a div that's inside of a container we have a form and a form has a form control uh maybe that form control is the problem because hey my message message message okay that's there um all right so let's take these divs out matter of fact let me start at the top and work my way back down to see if that will make a difference in the presentation of it okay so that works um and i was going off of what existed previously but you probably should not have dev okay all right so that being said now i need to i'm going to use paragraph tags instead that way i don't have to do line breaks after each one and it should automatically break yes there we go all right so uh that's a closing okay there we go that there that there that there and that there all right safe all right and so now to get our labels above um do line breaks on each one you could put your label on the line by itself to be honest and so instead of this do that and then do that whoops there we go safe now how does that look so that looks pretty well and if i put the class uh form control on here it should do some styling here yeah so it stretches it out the entire width of the screen which is what i want all right so to do the same for the other elements some have to oops copy yeah there we go and go ahead and move this up paste and while we add it remove that other code that is no longer needed so that there right save so now um the next part is to actually i didn't do that for the labels like i should have so we'll come back here and drop that in behind each of the labels and then we'll save and then come back and put the label excuse me the class of form control on each of the labels copy paste put that in there paste do a format right quick because that's a little iffy looking all right and now we have our labels accordingly so if we come back again to our labels i want to make sure that people know that they are required so there's a label attribute called required um or is it is required maybe this is required okay that's not there i may have to come in and define that we also want to do font weight bold on this all right so that is bolded and that's what we want and so come over to the css uh that's bmp css there we go all right and i'm gonna go down here at the bottom and do a dot required and i want to is it after something uh let me see how i did it in here because there is a way that you can have your page excuse me there's a way that you can have the css to add characters to the beginning or the ending of an element and i'm not sure if i i know i've done it on other sites i'm not sure if i've done it on this one yep here we go so label required and literally i can just copy this and paste that in required after and label that required and i want to use the um we'll go with the nesby red on this one since this is a brighter red color so if you come back to the page uh not required the required is a class and that class is on that label it should accept oh it doesn't accept that because i need to minify the file and there we go all right and so my metaphy file is being referenced in my html here so that's why that did not work all right the next thing um these attributes look a little bit small compared to what they probably should be on the page and also kind of look a little bit spaced out in my opinion so let me do this with the line break instead and that's a little bit closer and then i think i'm gonna make this a little bit bigger so we can just take out each of these paragraphs and replace them with line breaks and sometimes you'll have to do i know you're thinking well you just typed that code in now you're taking it back out yes because sometimes when you're designing things you run you know you type it initially and then when you actually look at it once you've implemented your light that doesn't look right it needs to be fixed and so that's essentially what has happened in this case for me is i didn't like the way it looked so i went back and redid it being very proficient with the keyboard and the shortcut short keys or excuse me the short being proficient with these keyboard and the shortcuts on the keyboard for the application that you are using helps i use visual studio code for my personal development but i also use uh visual studio in my day-to-day work and so sometimes that has a tendency because i'll type the wrong shortcut in and get either no action or get an unexpected action and that's always interesting to have to deal with after the fact all right the last thing i need is a input button of type submit with name submit and value of submit that is proper cased and saved and then also need to add the class of vtn and the btn um there's another btn i'm not sure what it is hold on all right so i got to input let's go to the css and look for the dtn classes so we got a btn got a btn footer you got a regular btn for the links all right so whoops and that's associated with that all right so coming back so let's do btn.dark for the moment and see what that looks like so that looks fine um i don't know if it's black or not let me see inspect element and pcn dark is dot black all right so what i think i'm going to do is to go ahead and overwrite so btn do a class btn-dark and um we'll do a background come on color that is black and save and so re uh modify the file that will update the css for it and if we refresh the page and do an inspect element this should have all zeros which it does so that is good to go all right so we'll close out the dev console and come back over here and copy the text off of the uh wait a minute oh i do have text on this page okay so let me do come back to the page because i realize now my if condition is incorrect so i don't need this else here but i do need that page content because the page content and actually in this particular scenario the page content comes above this if condition because i want the form to be at the bottom of the page not at the top all right now we have everything on the compact page correct so we have our introductory set of information along with social media and email at the bottom and just a basic form message comment question now the submit handler is set up it should not do anything well yeah okay should verify that this field is not blank all right so you type that in there it's still blowing red for the uh the phone number which is should because it's not in the expected format all right so if we do submit so at least 12 characters you are using eight so let's see all right okay so we're still complaining that format does not match which is great and this one is already being validated because if we come here should be being validated as an email address if not i need to um i'm not sure if i have a email form so i can come back to my partial i have a contact i don't think i have a contact i do have a request service page that has a form on that emailer placeholder you got emailer men link is equal to five on the form that i use and the placeholder text is there um i don't think i put it placeholder text in here so user add i'm gonna do an sbmp.org to place that and we'll do all right so formats of each of those and we'll change this here to i have a question about svmp and so if i come back to the site and so placeholder text is filled in behind here and if you actually go ahead and click contact again that will clear out the entire form the placeholder text is there if you try to submit it by default obviously it's not going to do anything but that is how that works and then our submit function which will be called by this particular url we'll send it over to our submit page and then we need to have a page that the submit page or the submit script rather redirects to so we're going to call that submission and so name that submission.md and looking at my existing code i think the only thing i have in submission is that that page is not indexed and so if we go back over to the docs folder and mine i actually think i have it submit slash index no that's not it okay so here we go submission and so my submission has a redirect built into it and that is it so let's look at the raw text and literally just copy that and paste that in here title submission successful and it needs to redirect back to the root page i also need a [Music] as you see in the submission page i do not want google to index this nor do i want it to follow the links on this page um it could follow the link because this link actually just goes back to the home page but i don't want it to follow the link and i don't want it to index it so i've added this robot's uh attribute in here and in my base template file i have in the metadata as soon as we can get back up to the top of the screen here i have a robots attribute here that says that if the robot's file if the robot's keyword is in the metadata of that particular page then you follow what's in there otherwise you can do it index and follow for whatever it is so uh no concerns would this be an index and should not be to further make sure that that doesn't happen we can come actually come down here to the robot.txt and come think of it i actually need to move this so we're going to cut that from right there and put that into the docs folder um there we go so we have a robot txt and you can have a disallow attribute here and do a slash submission be that and then um there's also slash submission slash index.html all right and so that way it ensures that no crawler will run across this file and put the submission page as a page on a google search result or go or bing or whatever you use for your primary search engine and then the submission page um this submission script rather it should email out and if you want this you can just copy it out of the repository the link is down in the description below where you can view this repository you will need to define some variables here i have helped this email in here and i think i'm still going to leave it at that and then that will be sourced in a configuration file this path may need to change depending on what it has or where it's located on the server in production i haven't logged into the production server in some time so i will need to figure out where i can stick this outside of the web route so that this can be called as neby so that is essentially how i do forms within a mk docs website so if i come back to the contact us page so as you see we have a full form here and ready to go i know some people they put the submit button as the uh well submit and then there's usually a link that goes to cancel or something of that nature i usually don't do that usually i figure if somebody's going to go to a page and they don't really want to submit it they'll find and go to wherever else they need to go so they may click the contact page again and that will clear that out for them or they'll go up here and hit refresh and which will also clear that out for them too all right that being said move on to the next item and i think i have all of my pages covered so my social medias are working and they are referenced on the contact page phone number is working for the chapter we have our links that point to various aspects of things on nsbe and what i want to do that i'm just now noticing is like i don't have the https on all of the urls that reference some of the other sites so i want to go ahead and put the https in there does it make a difference maybe maybe not but if the https does not work that's not my fault that means the url on the other end is not using https and while it may penalize my site i'd rather redirect users to another https site instead of just the http due to uh demand in the middle of the tax that exists as well as the google you know factoring in https for its own site and for its own purposes so here we have all of these things corrected let's do format on this uh uh actually do a trim on this thing and then do format all right and so i notice it's weird i was doing some of these paragraph tags on one line and some of them not on the other so let's do format again all right so i like to see consistency in my work and because i like to make sure that it is readable a little bit of ocd if you ask uh me in some regards but i do believe that neatness is helpful and a little bit of spacing is useful like as you see i use one space between blocks of code i know some people they'll use four or three or two after that but i just go with one because obviously everything else is bumped up next to each other so i know that's one grouping same thing here with this particular card i know this entire card is grouped together because i have a separator of white space or blank line if you will in between the two all right so contact form is done with the page content showing and just to verify that i haven't broken anything else again go through your site checking looking at the various pages make sure everything is still the same images are not you know sideways or anything of that nature buttons are still appropriately displayed and links are still working and that's not the link that i wanted to click all right program so we come over here look at some of the stuff here at the scholarship and so forth and so um yeah so there's that i may do another role of these blocks here that also highlight the scholarship program that we have some other information maybe about the chapter and maybe another block for membership um so matter of fact i guess we can just go ahead and work on that now and as soon as i can locate the text alright so here we have a container and a row so what i'm going to do is actually just go ahead and copy this entire row from get her here copy enter paste there we go all right and so for this one want to we'll do join nsbe on this one and i know in the other video you probably like from the other video you probably may have remembered if you have watched it it's like did we already do this yes and i went back and changed them because i thought that it would be more appropriate to highlight the involvement of the kids and there as well as some of the other things um first instead of what i originally had which i think the first name was join so we'll put this scholarship and what's the other thing i can highlight uh so i have joined scholarship and let's see programs professional development we got our nesbi jr already highlighted about and i guess we could do meetings as the other thing because we do have meetings every month so we'll do meetings here and i'm actually going to take this and put the meetings up here before programs and cut that programs off there and put it down here at the bottom and save and so yeah all right and so meetings so and i'm [Music] actually okay for the meetings i really can display all of the information here for meetings and it pretty much is that uh tuesdays first of each month all right so if we come over here to got that we got the first three and then we got the um so i'm gonna do like i mentioned earlier uh have a closing tag so end of first row and then come down here to the bottom well end of headings is fine so scholarship programs meetings so in the meetings block we'll put that there save come back to the home page and so we have meetings um clean up this text meetings are held the first tuesday each month at 6 00 p.m central time there we go all right uh and so now i'll come back at some point later and update this join i can go ahead and do the links right now at least so the join will go to the membership page the scholarship will go to the scholarship page and the programs will go to the programs page which is good and then the meetings will also go to the programs page as well and so if we do meetings and scroll down and i actually want to do a uh so we do programs with uh i guess the jump to professional development we'll save that and so if we go here and then back to meetings it should jump down to professional development which it does so that's good all right and um a membership that goes to membership all right cool and the scholarship goes there and so a couple of things i want to get is a sign up mailing list sign up page uh we'll actually get have to get the information or a piece of the information from mailchimp because they provide a like i think a form builder in their site that you can use and that form builder will spit out whatever it spits out and then all you have to do is copy and paste that into the page itself and it should be good to go all right so if i have some additional uh i guess call out actions here i can add that here but um it looks a little bit better now that i have more items here because originally i was just thinking that there was a few items um here and it was not very much white space to be honest and i wanted a little bit more white space taken up or more things that's taken up in the white section of the page so it's good to have a little bit more content here on the home page for that um so if you come back over here uh so your jump down links work as well there like you should if you come over here so this is one of the contact pages links that i was talking about so you click that here and it goes to the contact page and all the contact information is here melon dress phone and so forth all right so scrolling through everything else still looks like it works like it should this image here i'm not sure why this image is still acting the way it's acting but it is active when the way it's acting and so um not really much i can do about that at this time but hopefully i'll get that addressed so these buttons are turning gray when i mouse over not sure if i'm okay with that let's go back over and look at so we have the secondary button class here on those um is that right yeah i got the center secondary button class on here i'm not sure if i want to keep that secondary button class or not i guess it wouldn't hurt that that's there um the worst case scenario again and probably just have to take it back off and change it to something else maybe change it to black so instead of secondary we'll change this to btn dark and if we come back up here which one did i change so the join all right so that turns black and it kind of coordinates with the buttons down here at the bottom so i guess i'll go ahead and do that with the rest so btn dart btn dark dark dark dark dark and dark there we go all right so when you mouse over now they all turn black well i forgot one oops which is fairly easy to do sometimes all right so now that one turns black all right so we are good on each of those and then it's good to see that each of these headings are lined up across even though the items above are not necessarily the same height that these second row of things are aligned because of the fact they are in a row um so going to resize this just to show you the resizing of the items so let's say you're on a phone and you're looking at this this is what it would look like so you have this navigation here and that's not centered but um and that's really not centered so that's something we have to address as well actually none of these photos are centered so uh i had to see how i can address that so that at least the center of the photo is there and it is being resized accordingly because that is not resizing like how i would like it to or it to be the carousel but these the individual heading or subsections down here on the home page they look pretty decent to me as well as the items in the footer they are sorted how i would like them to be with the copyright down at the bottom so if we click the hamburg icon and just go to the other pages and see how they look you want to check to make sure that when you're building a website that you resize it now you can use the dev tools it's the dev tools it does have a mobile setup so if you hit f12 and come over i believe it's over here there you go so and you can change it to the corresponding device that you want to use but my personal preference is just to not do it that way instead i rather take it out of mobile mode and i'd rather just resize the entire screen over here and then you're able to see it how things will look in that resized uh position and so so far everything is looking all right to me and i gotta learn that that the events goes to a different page not here all right so this page is pretty straightforward i'll probably i actually will put a heading or header graphic there just like this has a heading graphic and to complete this section here of the executive board and all the scroll bars and everything else um but what you don't want to have is a website that has a horizontal scroll bar meaning a scroll bar that goes left and right because personally i hate having to scroll left and right even when i write my code i don't have it in a way now because i have it zoomed in it's going to have the scroll bar here when i pull up this uh left sidebar but when i do that it is resized and it doesn't have a horizontal scroll bar and just to make sure my lines don't get too long to prevent that i have this character line set at roughly about i believe 80 uh characters or something like that nature or this it says a hundred and it says 111 so it's probably setting like 110 or something like that nature and that way you get a decent amount of line you know all the way across and uh it works but not so far of a line that it just keeps going and going and going because i know some people they like to write their lines as very long and they end up having to scroll left and right up and down that's very difficult in my opinion to manage it's easier if i can see like for instance this could easily span this text area could obviously run off the edge of the screen if i would have put another attribute in here as you see is right at the edge but i'd rather be able to see this entire thing on a single line i mean excuse me on a single screen versus having it on a single line but that is a prep prince that is usually determined by each developer all right yeah so let's see what page i am missing i have a photos page it'd be kind of ironic to not have a photo on the photos page maybe that's just me so let's fix that right quick so i have some existing photos in here uh let's copy we'll go with this one so we just copy it and on the photos page here we go so using our metadata image url slash images i wish we would have copied that didn't i believe this is this is this one or this one actually i'll yeah so let's copy that all right so that slash jpg and image alt all right and so now if we come back to the photo page yeah there we go and alternate text so we do view image info we got the alternate text it did not say that is it not there that is weird all right new page source if i can do that um i actually do i'm gonna do inspect element and use the inspector to so the alt tag did not show up i wonder why oh cause i mistyped alt and this atl versus alt that's a big difference all right so now there we go so we have our alt text and if we do image info oops image info there we go we have the associated text there all right f12 on that so that's good and i'm gonna have to come back and resize that image anyway because when you do the full size of that image it does blow up to mass proportion um because it's in this original size and so i need to scale it down so that when i run the speed test on this site once it is deployed to us in production environment that i get a good speed test rating a lot of times you will get a bad speed test rating not because of the number of images on the page but because the size of the emerald images like resolution size of the images are way too high like they're in their original format and so you have to scale them down otherwise your speed scores particularly for the mobile devices speed score will be very low or medium to very low desktops are usually more tolerant of that larger file size because they usually have higher connection speeds so usually a 100 megabit or even gigabit internet versus a mobile phone that does not necessarily have that type of connection speed so there's the difference in that regard that will wrap things up for this video going back tomorrow for the last part of the series where i discuss the automated deployment setup as well as do a final review of the website after it has been deployed into production until next time peace out

(Unedited)","text":"<p>continuing with the next step in the process what i'm going to be working on is to do the automated deployment now what i'm going to actually do is leverage the existing automated deployment setup that i have for my website and pretty much copy it tweak it as navy for this website that i'm building let's get into this after this intro all right what i have here is i've already set up the host name the private key and the username for this particular repository the credentials that you'll need are the credentials that you would normally use to ssh into a server the private key is what you will need to create you use the command on linux servers called ssh keygen and it will ask you a series of questions such as where you want to save the file and if you want to put a passcode with that and what you will get is two files you get a public key and a private key the public key is what will need to go on the github side and excuse me the private key is what needs to go on github which is this here the public key will need to go into your authorized keys file on the server so i've already done the step because these keys have confidential information in them you know if you're able to see the key then you can log in i did not do that step on camera if you're interested in learning how to do that uh drop a comment down below to let me know that you're interested and i could probably do that in a future video that is not as critical so that you can see the entire process from beginning to end that being said so i have all of this information here so what i'm going to do is i'm coming to the repository of my personal website and i'm just going to copy the yaml file that is in here and come over to the repository uh for this particular project and create a new folder first i need to create a folder and the way github actions work is you have to create a github folder and then underneath that folder you have to create another folder called workflows and then underneath that you will create a file that does the actual actions and you can name this file whatever you want and so i'm going to do uh let's see we'll go with uh deploy to production that's the name of the file and the file needs to end with the yml extension so i'm going to go ahead and remove the stuff that i know i don't need i also need a port number i forgot about that because the production web host does have a particular port number that is not the default port number that has to be used so i'll have to go back and add that key to add this secret to the repository and then so add that secret here and then this will work but right now it almost works it's just that part is missing okay that being said um the branch so we're going to stick with master on this one right now we're the at the time of the release of or the recording of this video uh ubuntu 20.04 is available but 18.04 is what i am using and i know works with my website as far as this script goes so i'm not going to change that you know in the future i may change it to uh when you know 1804 is not the i guess the main thing that's being used also just remove the spelling because i'm not going to do spell check on this content i want it to be able to go through if it has spelling errors uh they'll just have to be fixed when they're fixed all right and uh pretty much everything else in here is correct as is so you do a checkout of the repository you do a install of the various python 3 modules then you do a fetch so you get all of the branches that are available in the repository and then deploy do a build of the repository to the website branch and then after that you'll do a uh you'll do a log into production and then have production do a pull of the website branch and so before i do that though i'm going to have to make some adjustments on the server because right now it is looking at the main branch i believe and there are some files that have been updated so if i try to do this right now is not going to work it's going to complain that there are some issues because i saw in the logs on the server that it was complaining about trying to commit something and it did not know what commit was and it wasn't pretty error messages all right so i have my file here set up and i want this to pretty much deploy on when any branch well i only want this to deploy when the master is touched and so uh right now everything is not ready to go so i still would like it to potentially even try to build though at least just not necessarily deploy so i may create another workflow that only does build without the deploy but i only wanted to deploy from master and that's it okay so let me go over here to the commit or the version control screen and so i do need to add this particular file here and let me pull up another window that shows the commits for automating deployment to production so that it looks like i created two of the same thing all right so items 22 and item 20 the workflow file has been created okay and we'll do enter on that and the rest of that is doesn't need to be touched so we go ahead and push this up to the repository and it doesn't like that so i'm gonna have to go to the terminal and do this and that's for some reason in visual studio code sometimes i have issues with pushing up to the repository and so i have to go over to the terminal and mainly push like the ubuntu terminal not the visual studio code terminal because of the credentials that it's using it will still try to use those same credentials if i use the visual studio code terminal all right next thing up is like i mentioned i need to fix that port number so i'm going to do that off camera i have now added the port number and again i wanted to do that off camera so that you know i don't have the site being hacked and so i have all four of the secrets that i need to use and so just to talk a little bit about the secrets files if you want to have like secrets or environment variables in here uh basically you code a variable name or if you will in your github workflow and when your workflow encounters this it knows to go over to the secrets and pull that secret out and you can't see what once you put the secret in you can't see it like you need to update it or remove it but you can't do and edit so just keep that in mind that like if you're doing like a private key or something like that nature make sure you have it already staged and everything before you drop it in here because once you drop it in here it will not allow you to visualize it any further you know not be able to see it again so just keep that in mind the as far as the actions to build this site and ubuntu 18.04 it does not have the necessary packages for python 3 and thus why i'm having to run each of these python commands so i want to do the upgrade of pip but sometimes pip the depending on the docker worker that you get pip may or may not be up to date so update pip and then for mk docs you need to also have setup tools you then obviously install mk docs and install the manify plugin come to find out i don't really need the rss plug-in because i'm not using this for vlogs so i can remove that out and then i'll commit that on the next go-round the next part is that i want to do a fetch and i'm just going to uh put a name with this as well and stated that it is fetching all of the branches there we go and then going to deploy to the website branch which is doing python 3 mk docs with github deploy after that you're going to do the deploy step so if any of these steps here fail then the deploy step will not run and the way that is set up is all of these steps have to succeed before this group of steps can run and use the needs attribute for that and so i say needs mk dots and i group this set of steps as the mk docs so that's how it knows hey if this doesn't fail don't run this one uh the same set of commands are going to run you on ubuntu 18.04 and then i have a github action by fifth sky i assume that's or f if sky i don't know how you say that username um but he has a ssh action that will run a set of commands that you specify so what i have it doing is going so once it logs in it will cd and then change to the www directory and then do a get pull of the origin website branch and that is it and then it'll log out and so let me go ahead and go to the server now i need to go to the web boot directory and remember i mentioned that there's an issue with the get repository because it says something i saw in some of the logs about the commit message and i'm not sure how long this is going to take to run i see it says refreshing the index all right so i have some civic crm files and there's some other files in here that it is complaining about that i'm not too really particular of so what i'm going to do is to copy the so i'm going to go ahead and stage the existing files that is talking about and then do commit on those files all right and there we go and these additional files i believe they could also be staged as well so i'm going to do get add sites all modules cbcrm there we go i don't want to commit the settings file or that other directory because they have some database credentials and other things that i don't want out there on the open internet so i'm not going to do that added civi crm files all right and we don't we have civic crm installed but we don't use it so i like i say it's still installed here but it's not used all right so if i do a git pool like it's mentioning because my origin and master have diverged like first i'm doing get fetch and it should refresh a whole lot of stuff which it did all right now i can do a get cool well gift status and so i am on the master branch get cool and i'm going to go ahead with that merge exit get push and it sends all that back up and i don't believe there's a lot of files that it needs to push but there may be a lot of files that it needs to push uh like i said i haven't updated this site in a while because i knew that this update was going to be coming and drupal 7 which is what the site is currently running on is slated to be retired and so it's like why bother updating it if i know it's going to be retired really soon all right so for the sake of in case something goes wrong i'm going to make a backup directory and then i'm going to move the well go ahead and make a copy of sites and connect as well as sites default cbcrm over to that backup directory all right and so if i do a ls of the backup directory [Music] uh no ls of backup there we go so i have it should be two in there i think i need to la yes there we go so we have a backup of those files that i did not commit now if i do a i believe it will work now so if i go ahead and do a pull request for this repository uh in the worst case scenario i'm gonna have to come back and save some of the files but i think i have all of that covered so i'm gonna do uh not sure why it's not letting me go ahead and do that because i base that branch off of the master so the entire version history is there if i did do some enhancements and some bug fixes so we'll just go ahead and mark those two create the pull request and let's see what it does not like about this pull request so there are some conflicting files i need to [Music] all right resolve the conflicts why are there conflicting files because what i recall i deleted those files or maybe because it when i did it i probably just because i committed those files just now that might be the problem with that all right so let's follow the command line instructions and i'm going to come back to my local and do a get fetch as it's suggesting and so it really said get fetch origin but i'm already set up on the origin so there's nothing else to fetch and then get check out some already so do well i already have good status um all right so let me go ahead and whoops all right so let me go ahead and do get at this existing file uh i think that was item 20 believe it was item 20 yes items 20 and 22 and 20 pound 20 added updated workflow config gotta type it correctly work flow config all right and then do a push of that all right so that has been pushed up and it's checking obviously that issue still exists and so now we'll do uh get status to see which branch i'm on and i really i don't know if it's going to make me move these files but i don't need to necessarily commit those files so since i already have the mk dot branch checked out i can do a get so let's do get merge master um okay i already have it why didn't it not okay so get fetch all right get uh let's do get check out get check out master and be more specific get cool origin master all right get check out mk docs which is the where i put the thing is now if i do get merge master all right now i have my conflicts and so i can do get status and see the two conflicts so deleted by us so i still want to remove those files so get rm includes common and includes uh includes form dot inc all right get status and so those files have been new changes to be committed so i also want to go ahead and remove these out and so if i do [Music] a um so to get rm sites all i guess those files can go ahead and be staged and then i'll probably have to come back and uh remove those again forget status get commit without a message and it's going to automatically create a message and then you can look into the history of what it's going to do so it's going to add these files that i just recently submitted but i can come back and remove those later so that's fine with me all right so master has been merged into mk dots get status not sure why maybe do it that way um all right so now it says for step two check out master get merge dash dash no ff mk docs all right that is done get push origin master and provide my credentials all right so that has been updated should see it refresh and now that has been addressed and i can delete the mk docs branch i'm not going to do that just yet so let me go over here and check my github actions and i do have my deployment action running and so if we come over here i probably don't want to show this while it's running so wait till it gets done so come over here to the master branch and all right so i do have my mk docs branch i do have another branch in here that i attempted to redesign the website and uh i never used so while we're waiting on that action to complete i can go ahead and remove this unused branch so bye bye to that all right still waiting on a github action to complete as you see that's indicated by this yellow arrow here and if i come back over to actions um i'm not sure what all is going to output onto the screen that's why i don't want to show that right now uh but i can't show you that everything in here so i added a readme file to this particular project and also since i'm from switching technologies i guess i can go ahead and update the tags that are over here so we are no longer let's see so this site is no longer using drupal so i'm going to go ahead and remove drupal here it is non-profit we'll do a static um what was that tag let's see stem non-profit a non-profit website from google seven okay so static and static sites also static sites static site generator and then um static maybe website yep static website generation um got nsbe that is a tag or uh engineering engineering organization we'll put that there okay and so the reason i am doing it this way uh of adding these topics here is because that helps you know with this repository being able to be found and we don't have any packages we don't have releases and i'm gonna uncheck the environments too because it's designed in a way that the environments will work uh without any issues so the deployment failed and i'm sure it has something to do with the ssh keys no okay so there's a refusal to emerge unrelated histories cool all right so if i come back to the production and go to the web root directory to get status and i might have to mainly do a get check out uh no i'm sorry do get fetch uh there we go all right and it should update this master branch and maybe i need to go and update the commands that is executing on the server as well all right so now if i do a get pool and then it should update everything now there we go all right so now if i go to the website i should see the new website up and running which i don't or oh three that is never a good thing that you want to get is a 403 and just to make sure all right so it checked out the master branch which you should not have so get check out website and then from origin slash website get fetch let me see hold on this is not auto completing so that's slightly concerning get branch dash a not double a single a all right so get checkout i guess this won't do it website origin slash website [Music] that should work here shortly might take a second what i missed was the dash b command because this branch has never existed in this particular server it when it tried to do that automated deployment it failed because you can't check out a new branch and so forth and so uh yeah that made sense why it didn't work all right so now i do see my files and so if i do a refresh i should get a page yes so this site is now working in production um from the last set of videos there you probably noticed there is some changes here i did a lot of minor tweaking such as getting this carousel to not stretch the image and a number of other things on here off camera because it took it took me a while to get all that done but if you want to see all of those minor changes or how they're implemented you can easily go check the repository that contains this information and you know all of that there so now what i'm going to do is to actually go through and check to make sure that everything looks correct and so far so good there may be some minor changes that i may need to make at a later point as i can you know continue to do a deep dive but for the most part it looks like all of the links are working like they should be working and so there are no concerns with that so if you come back to the github repository i mean excuse me you come back to my local setup and i do a pool uh excuse me do a fetch not a pool all right so the 960 branch got deleted and we now have a new branch called website so at no point should you ever have to update this website branch this branch is specifically for the deployment and the static html css and javascript files what i do want to check though i think i need to check a couple of other things such as the make sure that i am using minified css and javascript files i believe i did put the minifi for well nope so it looks like i missed one here so let's reference that and then while i'm at it go ahead and open that file and do the minification on it as well as go ahead and trim this one do the arrow trim there we go to make sure and i'm also going to come back and format this uh format document there we go and trim volumetic two all right so all of that looks good all of that looks good and so if i come back over to the terminal and do a get status i do have my base html and css files that have been updated in particular the minified file and let me see just one more thing before i do a commit and push this up because this commit when i push it up will actually deploy up to the production automatically it should not have any issues so this will be another test of that before everything uh before i call this a close to the project um all right so yeah we have all the css files minified if we go down here there's a script so that's also minified so should be good to go so if you do get status status all right hit commit and we'll do i'll go ahead and close out the issue that i have open here so let me go back to the repository and so i still have open 24 and 22 and 20 23 is i'm still waiting on some more information for that one so i won't be doing that right now but that's simple when you for payment buttons you can uh depend on the platform that you're using you can get those if you're using platform like we use uh you can just go into clap paypal and request those buttons to be created enter the necessary details for those and it gives you the html code and all you gotta do is copy and paste html code into the website all right so updates completed all right get status and do get push and then i'm gonna remove these images that i did not commit to the repository out of here and that way these errors this red uh set of files so these untrack files will be removed all right so that branch has been updated so if we uh come back to the code you should see the automated deployment running which it is and so it is preparing that push and um there are some other minor tweaks that i'm probably going to have to do such as the hd access files uh get those staged in the appropriate places because one thing that i've noticed with mk docs is the mk the hidden files usually it will not deploy those to it will not consider those when you do your deployment and so what you have to do is you have to stage that file make the necessary updates stage it manually um since it won't automatically stage it for you and then just have an exclusion rule and uh on the server i believe where it ignores that if it you know encounters it or anything of that nature one other thing i'm going to also have to do i did not test this locally because i do not have php set up on this particular computer but i want to set up the uh confirm that the email setup is working correctly and that the php script that i have is working i need to implement those variables here so i will do that off camera pretty much i have the help desk email so where is it going to email this form to and i think that's pretty much it because everything else in this form because i've copied it from what i currently use is pretty much straightforward so keep in mind like i've mentioned this before but i'll mention it again when you write code especially code that you're writing on projects that you are doing for whatever personal purposes then keep in mind you know be able to reuse that code if you're building code at work you know you're not necessarily going to be able to do those things but you can kind of reference what you've already done and use that to your advantage so it's kind of a similar system scenario but you is you probably won't be able to copy your code that you're doing at your job to your personal projects but you can kind of structure it in a similar manner for that you know site to be able to achieve that same goal all right so the automated deployment did complete successfully as you see there is a green check mark here as denoted by the uh for the action that it did perform so all of those are good and so um there's no i don't think i made a significant change on here that you would actually be able to see it one thing i have considered doing is to make sure that my deployments are making making it to production without actually having to log into production and check the date and time stamps is to be able to check have a bill date somewhere in the either in the bottom of the footer or somewhere in the source code of the webpage and that way i can look at that as well as a kind of a confirmation because github will report success but sometimes that success may not actually be successful depending on if you type the wrong commands in or something of that nature so having that bill date in here would help with that confirmation but i'm not too concerned with that like if i see something that's just like really really far off then i know something's probably going array or not quite right all right that will believe we'll cover this part of the video series where we i set up the automated deployment again it's very straightforward if you want to you can copy this particular workflow file i have a link to all of this information for this entire week series of videos down in the description that way you

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on good people so this video will be another coding challenge this coding challenge will be doing the fizz buzz you've probably heard of this one before uh believe it or not i've actually done this in an interview before i think it had different words with it but it was still the same concept without further ado let's go ahead and jump it right into it [Music] all right so here is the coding challenge for this video and it is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 or for multiples of 3 print fizz instead of the number and for multiples of 5 print buzz for multiples which are for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print fizz buzz that being said uh is pretty straightforward as you see there's an example here so let's go ahead and get right into it as like with the last coding challenge i will be doing this in net core and all right so now that my system is decided to start responding once again um what i'm going to do is i'm going to open a new actually i need to create a new project i've created a repository with all of these coding challenges in it so a link to that repository will be down in the description below if you've missed a previous coding challenge all that code will be in the same repository i figured i would put all of these coding challenges into the same repository that way um they have a central location for where they can be easily found all right so i'm going to create a new project so again using the.net core we're going to do net new console and we're going to give it a name of fizzbuzz all right and that should create a new folder called fizzbuzz as well as set up everything we need for the project so if we cd into that directory we have our project now let's go ahead and create a uh get ignore file for this particular directory that way we don't commit our project files such as the actual executables to the repository now that we have done that we can go into visual studio code into the appropriate directory and open the project that we just created from the command line and then we can open our program.cs i'm going to update the namespace to customize it to my particular setup or how i prefer to do things and i'm also going to remove the hello world out of here and it wants to reboot through the assets required so we'll go ahead and click yes on that and now so we have a program that prevents prints the numbers from 1 to 100 so what i will do is to create a for loop we'll do it i starting with 1 and while i is less than or equal to 100 we will increment i um this is your basic for loop and this for loop replies to regardless of what language that you're doing um the next step so we need to determine whether the number that we're currently on is a multiple of three a multiple of five or a multiple of three and five so the way i'm going to do this is to do a uh we'll call it a string with output and we'll set it to an empty string and then if i is divisible by three then we will add to that string fizz all right and uh also do i know you're thinking well should you do it else if no so what i'm going to do is i is divisible by 5 then whoa all right we'll do an output of we'll do plus equals here buzz and looks like i'm missing some quotes all right and let's see if i okay i think i may have missed done this so if we do i divided by five and that equals zero that should work maybe i have the wrong type of slash there we go all right so i had the wrong slash on there all right and so what we're doing is we're basically doing division so if i divided by 3 equals 0 which i don't think this is quite right i want to use the modulus operator but it seems to be complaining about the modulus operator so we'll go modu modu lust operator c sharp all right and so we'll go to the internet and kind of look into this a little bit further to make sure we're actually using the right thing um because what i want is so let's see ah okay so we want is we want to do the modulus so we want the modulus is basically the uh mathematical representation of the remainder so when you're discussing um so let's say if you have 15 15 divided by three would be five with a remainder of zero and so that's where the modulus comes in and so uh i i think originally when i was typing this i did have the i percent three but i didn't have the equation of what to check and so it kind of flagged that let's see if we go back here um yeah so i didn't like that because it couldn't convert that type so this is actual condition so it can convert that and so the reason i'm doing it this way is because i want the fizz buzz to be able to show up so you have to do it in a certain way like i mentioned i've done this in as an interview question once before um so it took me a little bit moment but once i worked with the interviewer and discussed some things then we did get it correct and uh outputted all right so now that we have our fizz buzz portions what i want to do next is check to see if the output length is greater than zero and if it is then well excuse me correction let's do this so we want to do if the output link is equal to zero which means that none of these conditions were returned true then we want to set the output equal to the i dot tostring value and then we want to console.writeline uh the value of output all right and so don't want to remove too many braces so if we do format and trim if i run this in the terminal and it may ask me to do some other stuff before it actually runs off maybe not all right so it is building it is now running there we go all right so we have one two and if we come and pull up our image to kind of do a comparison so we have one two fizz four buzz is seven eight fist buzz 11 is 13 14 fizz buzz and that's where our example stops at but the pattern continues forward where it does the fizz buzz so let's come back to this code and do a little bit more elaborate walkthrough so we're basically we're do looping over the numbers one through 100 and we're initializing every time we start with another number we're going to set the output value to a empty string which is this here just two votes with nothing in the middle and then we're going to check to see if the number is divisible by 3 and if so does it have a remainder if it does have a remainder it will not output it will not add fizz to the output if it is if it does not have a remainder it will set that to the remainder will be zero then it will add fizz to the output then here we're going to do the same thing as we did for three but we're checking for five instead and this time since we already we may have fizz in the previous check we want to if this condition is true we want to add buzz to the output so we're going to do the plus equals operator now this operator is the same as if you were to do output equals output plus buzz all right as soon as i can get it type so that's the this condition is the same as this condition this is just a more concise way of typing this same statement all right and then the last check will be if the output length so the length of this variable is equal to zero which the length by default would be zero then we know that it does not have a fizz or a buzz contained in it and so based off of that we can set the number equal to i mean excuse me we said the output equal to the number that was currently being done in that for loop and then the last part is to print out that number to the console all right and so uh that being said i'll run it once more again just so you're able to see it um if you have any questions regarding this particular project drop those down in the comments below a link to the repository where you can find the source code for this will be available also and until next time peace out oh and well as you see it ran successfully again the 99 100 there you go all right peace out

(Unedited)","text":"<p>what's going on good people this video will be a coding challenge video the challenge is actually a little bit more difficult than what i'm used to this particular challenge is to create a hangman game and as you see here there is some criteria of the to do items and pretty much what the objective is on how to build out this game this core example starts off with python but of course like in convention we will do this in c-sharp using.net core let's get into it all right i have visual studio code already pulled up and all of the existing or prior coding challenges are available on github in a repo called coding challenge link will be provided to that repository to get started we're going to create a net core console application and i'm going to name it hang hangman no sense of overcomplicating the name and once that project is created i'm going to go into the hangman directory and dot net core uh get ignore and that's going to create a get ignore file uh oh sorry i forgot the new keyword so it's dot net new cool dot net new get ignore mess that up too all right let's try this one more time dot net new get ignored all right there we go so next i'm going to open the repository or excuse me open the project and i'm going to create the programs here open the program cs file and then we're going to remove this statement as well as update the namespace to my personal convention uh you can update the namespace to your particular convention if you have one for your applications and while we're at it we're gonna go ahead and let visual studio code build out the necessary files to build and launch the application all right next thing up is we're going to take the word list that is provided in the example code over here and we're going to type it in here um let's see if we can get both of these kind of yeah that works all right and the word list is an array now mind you this is in python so i'm going to stick with an array with this but i'm going to name the variables according to the c sharp syntax so we got aardvark got baboon got camel and that will be the end of that and then we have our to do one which randomly choose a word from the word list and assign it to a variable uh let's see if we can stretch this out a little bit or assign it to a variable called chosen word all right to do two says to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess and that probably should be in quotation marks make guess i think that's the non-quotation mark version of it lowercase and to do number three says to check if the letter the user guest with the guess in parentheses is one of the letters in the chosen word all right so a little bit complex a lot of comparisons that will have to be done to make this doable um i'm gonna go ahead and make this wrap so i don't have that horizontal scroll bar and that should be it okay i'm gonna do format and we'll trim any trailing spaces before we get started that being said we need to randomly choose a word from chosen word so we're going to create a random object and using the random class we will place that there and then we need to get a random and i misspelled answer here we will need to get one of these three words at random from the list so we will call a integer or define a integer wordless [Music] ant i think that's we'll stick with that name may not be the best name for it but we'll stick with it and we'll do a random dot next with zero being the lowest number and the max being word list dot leave this link yes all right and so that make sure that and this here will ensure that the wordless.length that is will ensure that we are not getting a word that is outside of the index of the array that is defined up here on line 9. next we need to assign the word to a variable called chosen word so create a string called chosen word and set it equal to word list with word list ant embraces and that will get aardvark baboon and i misspelled baboon babin isn't i don't believe is a word but it might be hard baboon and camel will be placed into the chosen word item all right task number two is to ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess make guess lower case so we're going to do a string of inputs input is equal to console dot three line and we're gonna check that to to lower and we're going to up here console.writeline and set this to enter a letter there we go all right and make it lower case so we've done that and the variable needs to go into actually it needs to go into guess instead of into a input and since it does say one letter what we could do is actually use a char called guess and because chart will only hold one letter or number or character and so that will minimize and make this a little bit easier to manage to get um so it does not like that so we may have to take this to lower out so let's go ahead and do that there and then uh really okay so uh well maybe not since it does not like that being done that way unless i can convert this read line to a char which i do not believe is possible i can do a char array and then get the first item out of that array so i may do that instead um yeah so to get the chart array and then we'll put that into a um char open close and then that'll be called yes that should be sufficient and then for each um var guess letter we're going to guest letter in guess we're going to do and actually that may not be the right way to do that so we'll do for it i equals 0 i less than um guess dot length i plus plus technically you should only be accepting one letter in here um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take whatever the user types in but then what i'm gonna do is actually only handle or process the first character that's in the full input so if they type 50 characters i'm only going to count the first one and that will prevent it from trying to compare a lot at once or um having too many values trying to come through at once all right so we want the first item out and so we want to set the we also want to change this lowercase because that's the other thing that we have to do with this so guess i equals um guess i dot two doesn't have a two lower case on here which is uh i believe is because the lower case only applies to a string and so what may have to do is to temporarily convert this to a string and make it lower case then set it back to a car [Music] so we'll create a string uh for now and then do temp equals temp dot to lower there we go and then we will set the oh and also need to convert this dot to string and then let's see can we do guess i is equal to temp i may have to do converts on this one dot char 2 char yeah and [Music] no it's not what i want convert dot sh [Music] oh i had to convert the um so temp dot string all right two two string two char array i'm sorry all right so now that we've converted everything back from upper to lower we converted back to our array and this may not actually even need to be done this way um because [Music] we're trying to do a single charge to a whole thing that may be a problem so i need to do a um let's do a char array that is actually so if i read this and then do temp plus equals now that resets every time so that's not going to work all right so i need a temp string outside of this yes so we'll do temp there do a temporary thing here set that to no value actually set that to an empty string to start with and then yes i said to string equals 10 plus equals temp and no actually i need to change that to a lower and then add it to the variable and then outside of that to attempt to back to guess and handle that so uh essentially this for loop will loop over every item in the array in the character or the guess array and from that change all of the values to lowercase equivalence and then turn around and put that into the char array i'm thinking that's probably the best route to do this may actually want to change this up though to be honest because it probably doesn't need to be a char array probably just needs to be just getting the first one so if we get the first um item out of here and put that in then we won't need to convert everything we just need to convert the zero index uh assuming that the zero index is well assuming that there's something that has been typed in because if there's nothing that's been typed in then that doesn't matter um so we can just do that instead of looping through the entire list of items so we'll do a string temp let's move this here and change adjust the indents um better yet i'm thinking well since we're only supposed to store the guess and that variable name guess um what i'm gonna do is leave that there so we'll call this a uh char i can't change a chart to a chart array so we'll change it to a string for the um wait guess and no so we'll call this input then we'll do input of zero is assigned to the string guess and then from here yes equals guess dot to lower and we can do away with that now that seems to be a little bit more simplified for what we're trying to do all right so now that we have the first character out of our string we actually probably want to check to make sure that the string is actually has a value here so i want to do input dot length is greater well yeah greater than zero then we want to do the stuff inside the if condition otherwise when you go to run this and the length is equal to zero then it will throw an exception for an index out of bounds and so obviously knowing that you don't want to code that in all right so that should do that particular part all right so the to do for number three is to check if the letter the user guest is one of the letters in the chosen word so to do that we'll do if um chosen word dot contains and guess yes okay and actually guest needs to come outside of this uh if statement so we'll do string guess equals to an empty string and so if that contains then console right line the letter you guess is contained in the word all right and obviously there's some more logic that needs to go in here um but i'm just putting these statements here for now so that we know what should go in each of these statements the letter and then i can do a uh the replacement string here is not contained in the word and then we'll do guess as that value then we'll come back up here guess and letter there we go is contained in the word got it all right so now that we have this existing logic well this logic in place what we want to do is to go ahead and build it and make sure that what we have is running thus far and also that it will build thus far but you will know though is that this will not repeat um once i put a letter in so if i type a letter um we'll do a capital p and for some reason i have issues with this working in visual studio code so let me open a terminal and run this application all right so i want to do dot net run from here and it should present the same information of asking for a letter to be entered i'm gonna do an uppercase p and it says the letter p is not contained in the word um we do not know which word that it picked so we probably want to add that piece of information to the output as well as the application uh that we're running because that's not also being output so we'll say welcome to hangman will be a capital h and we want to say [Music] all right so we have the chosen word so we can do console.writeline and say that the word has and we'll do a replacement there characters and with that we'll do chosen word dot length for the substitution value so now if we come back over to our terminal and run this again before enter a letter shows up on the screen it should say the word that we're looking for and so given that we only have three words it's pretty obvious which word that we're looking for and so the last time we typed p and we confirmed that p was not in the word uh whichever word it was but this time we actually know where it was which word it is because we can see the words and so we can type a letter in here uh we'll go ahead and type a and actually i'm going to type uppercase a just to make sure that the lowercase comparison is doing correctly and so the letter a is contained in the word and as you see it also dropped the lowercase or got the lowercase equivalent of that so that is working i did notice that the punctuation was missing so i'm going to add that in right now while i see it all right now we need this to continue to loop over instead of exiting like it's currently doing so what i'm gonna do is to include a while loop and i'm going to wrap that while loop around this to do and for starters i'm gonna just default it to true just so that the error messages go away but i'm actually going to fix that here shortly so that it um only actually is a legit while loop condition and so what we need to do is that we need to normally in hangman you have a number of tries so to do this number of tries you need to find a variable that does the number of tries or counts the number of tries we're going to call the int tries spelling this are uh yeah we call it entries and um or guess attempts would probably be more appropriate and we're going to initialize that to seven and then so while guess attempts is greater than zero because once you hit zero then you're out and we want to see that if the guess is not uh if the word is not correct then we want to remove the guess remove one of the guest attempts okay so since we also have the guest attempts we'll want to print the number of guesses remaining to the screen so we'll do console.writeline remaining attempts and we'll do the placement of the variable in there and semicolon and actually i'm go ahead and rename this to remaining attempts because it seems i'm trying to get away from using the same uh variable because we already have guess as a variable down here so when it comes to typing you'll try to make your variables fairly distinct that way if you have for example if you have string guess 2 well when you go to type somewhere down here guess it's going to auto auto excuse me it's going to uh use the intellisense and intellisense is going to throw whichever one it thinks you might be trying to type which in most scenarios for me uh doesn't necessarily make it to the correct one so i'm going to rename that for that reason all right now if we um come over here and run this and it will build all right so we have all the information welcome to hey man the word has six characters and enter a letter so we have let's say we're looking for t letter t is not contained in the word and as we also see the remaining attempt has dropped down by one to six and if we keep doing this and if you don't put anything in there the remaining attempts remains the same which is what we want um letter is not contained in the word and if we exit the loop we need to put a condition there that checks to see what happens after we exit the loop because there should be two conditions where you exit the loop if you run out of attempts or if you get the word correct so right now we're working on the attempts portion all right so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and we want to console.writeline you have ran out of attempts you lose and i know that's kind of a crude error uh it's a crude message but that's essentially what has happened all right that being said um the next part we can work on is actually doing the comparisons for if the guess is contained in the word so how do we do that um so we need to get the uh we need to also be able to display the word to which is a little bit complex um but i'm thinking we probably need to do the display in a separate function so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna build it out within this if condition and then take that statement once it's built out in if condition and move it over to a function where that would make sense and so i'm gonna go ahead and move this over to a function as well so we're going to extract a i believe it's extract method so that will take that to a separate method and [Music] pass that in and so if we come back up here and say exit game as the name of the function and we'll put all of the stuff that needs to be printed out to the screen inside of this exit game function and therefore you get a more concise uh loop and or main we'll continue that a little bit further and then um we could also leverage some class variables here too because we're using this function instead of passing these arguments in so what i'm going to do is actually make this remaining attempt into a [Music] if it'll let me do a cut it's not a constant um well one move it near the reference because it doesn't make sense that it's that far up uh all right now let's see if it'll let me do a not letting me do it so i'm just gonna have to force my way to do it we're going to declare a static variable with that in it all right and therefore if i have a static variable i do not need to pass the value in because the function the variable is because it's in the class it now knows what it is and so i don't have to do that um but that also means any function outside of domain can modify this value which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you're writing your code but it's fine in this case all right so now that we have our remaining temps configured correctly um the next step is to handle the correct guesses so we have it checking that if the letter is there then that is correct so we need to do a comparison of the we also need to track the letters that we already have guessed so let's do a um i want to declare another thing i want to declare another string array that says already guest letters and actually no that can't be an array so it have to be a list and the reason being that it would have to be a list is because that if it is an array that array will not uh hold the values in place so what i need to do is to do list of not word lists string and we'll call it already guest letters equals new list of string [Music] and we need to import a collection statement there for that which is [Music] system.collections.generic and let's see what else all right so we have that so we want to anytime we type a letter in we want to add that to the list of already guest letters so we're going to do already guess letters dot add and we want to add after we drop it to the lower case or convert it to lowercase then we want to add it to guess or add guess to it excuse me all right and let's see so that is correct um one other thing that i noticed that i probably want to go ahead and make it a little bit more difficult to make this a problem in the future is so the word list is already lower case but let's say somebody comes up in here and types a capital a in here instead well then we still wanted to remain lower case so i'm gonna do dot two lower on this uh setting of the word to chosen word that way that ensures that even if somebody does type a uppercase letter here that it is handled properly all right so we're adding our already guessed letters to the list and then we need to do a comparison of the already guessed letters versus the um not already guess letters what i'm thinking so um let me change this back for the sake of uh the way it should have been and already guessed letters so i want to i think we need to do a for loop on um you probably also need a variable up here that call uh that is a string that is called visible letters and we'll set that to that and then we want to set the divisible letters equal to wait 1 2 a 4 each var letter [Music] in uh actually no yeah before each in chosen word we want to set visible letters plus equals to star and that will be our masking of the letters um trying to think is that the correct that may or may not be the correct way to do it but this is one way that you can do this what i'm thinking is we may just need to cycle through each of the letters and if the letter has not already been guessed then that letter is replaced in the output before it is displayed to the screen and that way we know which letter um we don't have to keep track of the word in multiple well we may still need to do it in multiple variables won't be as difficult all right so let's see oh for each letter in chosen word uh or for each um yeah so for each letter um in already guessed honestly we want to start with the letters that are already visible and create a temporary string that will set so we'll do a um call a string display word set that the empty and then for each letter in chosen word we will do a comparison so if letter is equal to letter let's see no if trying to think already guess letters dot contains and then letter then and we'll make that a if statement i've already guessed letters contains letter uh with the letter passed in is that correct then we will add letter to the output so we'll call this uh or display so display word plus equals letter and if it does not else we'll do display word plus equals asterix and i think that's the proper way of doing that um what is wrong with this letter can i convert char to string got it so convert that to string with the parentheses that should handle that all right and so let's see what this does i want to remove this for the time being because i know i'm not going to need it and we'll come back over to our terminal window do clear and then do dot net run all right the variable visible letters is never used hmm okay that's fine i noticed i misspelled it too so uh we'll comment that out for the time being as well all right so our letter excuse me our word has eight letters uh we will have seven attempts enter a letter um so let's do an o all right so o is not included in the word six remaining attempts now i noticed something that the display is not printing out which it should be so that is a problem so let's move the display word um the display word needs to be reset every time it also needs to be visible where it could be fined [Music] so this way word contains guess as i'm looking at this i think i actually have the same condition in here or than i should because the same function is going to be called in either scenario [Music] and i need the display word to be kept in between cycles um so we'll do display word and i need another console right line because what i want to have happen is see how these are all crammed up right next to each other i don't want that to happen so what i'm gonna do is to after each attempt um so remaining attempts is six remaining attempts remaining attempts so i'm gonna add another console.writeline and just put a blank line there actually i don't even need quotes there just do it empty and that should do the same thing all right um now you could do all kinds of other kind of formatting like separating it with equals or not i'm keeping it simple so blank line will do in this particular case all right so now that we have guest letters and so chosen word contains yes then um and we may need to change this logic all together may rather need to do it this way instead of the other way um i'll leave it there for now all right so we need to reset this way word each time we come through and guess the right thing so what i'm gonna do is do display word it's equal to empty string um because if you keep appending to it then it won't be pretty after the second go around and at the end of the loop need to do console dot writeline and display work and that should be that all right so let's try this again clear the terminal run the application and let it build so now we have our space there so let's go ahead and type and oh all right so the letter o is not contained in the word got it so let's type in a it's still not printing my the actual word so that is a problem because it should be still displaying actual words so we may need to copy this here and put this there all right so let's exit and try that run again oops close ring let's run again let's put the letter o all right so now we're getting our word here so let's put the letter a and see what happens all right so we got the letter a and our attempts remained the same that's correct so we put the letter d we got our d what is it aardvark goes r we got our r and then we got a k and a v and we've spelled our word now only thing is a display word is the same as the actual contained word but we don't have a condition in our loop that would exit out that being said so we need to do if remaining attempts is greater than zero and if display word is not equal to uh nachos yeah chosen word i believe this is the correct way of doing this and then so if remaining attempts is equal to zero and then i want to put another statement here and have it say it could be an else statement here but i'm gonna do it this way if display and i don't have display word there so i probably will use an else statement here just to simplify this so if you're exiting the game that means you've done one or two things you've either gotten it wrong or you've gotten it right right line so you have won the game um and say you have yeah you have won the game that should be sufficient all right so coming back over here let's do a clear dot that run and hopefully this time uh get it right so our six letter word in our example is baboon so we can put a capital t in here for the sake of it and the letter t is not contained in the word now one thing we did not test but it should still work is if we put a number or a special character and i know you can't make letters and numbers out of special characters and there is a way to check that and make that possible but for the sake of this we are not going to add that logic we pretty much figure out if you put something in here that you shouldn't put in it's not going to work or it will be wrong so i put a pound sign in here and the letter pound granted that's not a letter um so we may need to change that output statement is not contained in a word so now that we have that there and i'm noticing something here is the original word has six asterisks here now this word has six plus six which is 12. so the condition to uh if your word is wrong is not doing something correct now i believe it's because it's not resetting the display word here so we needed to reset the display word regardless of where it's at so we need to move it up to here instead and i'm going to comment that out for the time being and then this here really needs to be a function because it is the same logic for both statements so i'm just going to go ahead and select that now do control dot and do extract method and so we're going to call this method um check this way i guess we call it um not check display let's see uh [Music] process display word all right and i know that's a mouthful but essentially that is what it's doing and so since this is the same as this down here it's going to go ahead and copy paste that there format and trim and then save so if we go back to our terminal and we'll try to run this again and make sure that that is correct all right so we have a five letter word a five-letter word in this example is camel so camel does not have an r in it so if we type r uh we get our five asterisks which we still should still have and then also have one less remaining attempt camel does have an m and we'll put it uppercase m in here for the sake of it it still should pass and it does and we still have six remaining c a let's do uh q for the sake of just because and e l camel so we have gotten the word and we have won the game um now if you want to you can take this a little bit further and actually do the drawing of the hangman part um i mentioned that earlier but i probably won't do that on this particular video because of the fact of drawing characters or ascii characters does take a little bit of effort um so let's walk back through the code one more time before we close out the video all right so we have our welcome to hangman opening here um we have our word list this word list can be longer just add more animals so dog you gotta do it in quotation marks dog elephants um ferrets uh efg so um giraffe there we go all right so we have one letter for the first one two three four five six seven letters of the alphabet that should be sufficient and then we did our two do one which is randomly choose a word from the list and assign it to a variable called chosen word so that's what we've done with these four lines here um we've had to add some additional variables here because of the fact we need to have those for our while loop and we also added the uh remaining attempts so that you know how many times you have remaining before you lose the game and then enter a letter so we need that information to prompt to the user for what for them to do something then you take that guess and process it accordingly get the first letter out of there if they put multiple characters in there it is possible you could handle that but for the sake of simplicity in this example we're only going to handle that with the by grabbing the first letter out of this string and do already guess letters with ad and um i actually come think of it i may actually have made a mistake i realize this condition may actually take [Music] um an error message i mean excuse me blank string and decrement the steps or decrement the remaining attempts but we'll have to test that again so already guess letters you add that to the guest the letters that have been guessed and then if the word is chosen contains the guess then that letter is contained in the word and we will process the display word so that is a number of arguments that are passed in and you loop over each letter in the chosen word and to see if that's there and so if if it is there you display that letter if not you show an asterisk in its place and then return this back to the caller um and then inside of that that would be it if you're doing this same set of stuff inside of the else condition you would decrement the remaining attempts and you would display the word uh regardless of you know asterisk letter combinations or just asterisks only once you get done with the while loop you will exit the game and that exit game comes down here and it determines whether you had zero remaining attempts and if you did have zero remaining attempts that means you ran out of attempts and you have lost the game um if you have remaining attempts that means you have won the game and one thing you probably want to also do here is do a console.right line and say the word was and then print out what the word was so um because usually if you lose you find out what the word is and so what we want to do is we'll probably have to set chosen word as so i set that one as a class variable i don't know if i want to do that well i'll go ahead and pass that in here as a class variable so um string um the word that's what i'll call this one here we'll wrong function all right so that there so therefore if you run out of attempts you do still find out what the word is and so now that we made that one adjustment let's do uh net run one final time so we have seven a seven character seven character word and seven remaining attempts so to enter a letter we're gonna do uh we'll put an h in there the letter h is not contained in the word um so most of the words if not mistaken all of the words well most of the words have the letter a so we can put a letter a in there all right so the letter a is in the word and i think i know what the word is based off what i've already entered letter g i r a f and there's two of those and we're gonna intentionally run out of letters even though we're so close and i kind of noticed something that well that's working correctly so if you put the same letter in twice uh as you see here i have a and i already had a in the previous go around it does not count off against your attempts because that letter already existed so that's something to keep in mind normally if you already guess a letter that's already been guessed then you have a output that says that letter has already been guessed and that logic can be added in here too as a if condition all right so continuing on let's finish out so that we run out of attempts and just gotta make sure i type letters all right so here we have it you have ran out of attempts you lose the word was giraffe and as you can kind of figure out that's kind of what it was based off the other guesses so that wraps that up for this video this video took a little bit longer than the previous coding sessions all the coding sessions won't necessarily be quick but um yeah this one hopefully you have learned a little bit um i know there are some video tutorials on hey this can be done in 10 minutes and more than likely those 10 minute videos are because of the fact they've already practiced it a number of times and they're just regurgitating that on video to have it done in a concise manner as you can see it took a decent amount of time and a lot of walking it through to get it to do what it needs to do so while you see those tutorials that may say i can do this in five minutes i can do it in 10 minutes actuality they probably practice it two or three times beforehand and then was able to go back and record it in the five to 10 minutes that you actually ended up seeing so any questions drop those in the comments this will probably not be the last of the coding challenges that i face and uh want to share with you so any questions comments comments uh the repository information will be provided so you can look at the source code for this until next time peace out</p>"},{"location":"technology/2021.04.01-git-local-branch-cleanup/","title":"Git Local Branch Cleanup","text":"<p>After you create a number of branches with git, it

to have this password generator be able to spit out multiple passwords at one time so basically you call the program with define some arguments and then it will give you know an output without you having to manually interact with the program the reason i want to do this is i want to be able to uh extend the functionality of the existing program but then also be able to do give it everything it needs in a single command and then it gives me everything back and then from there i could potentially use this in let's say a automation script to create users or use it in a script for like web driver for creating accounts or something of that nature and then also when it comes to the length of the password in the original coding challenge we had to specify the length of numbers letters and symbols this video i want you to try to get that so that if you don't provide or if you provide a argument it will just automatically come up with those numbers within a given range and then continue with the rest of the process that being said let's get started [Music] all right so this code will be available on github so if you want to have a copy of it by all means you can go to my github in the coding challenge repository this will be the password generator project and what i want to do so this code has not been changed it may have been modified a little bit i think i did add a function here to process the inputs and what i want to do is actually change that so that the if a value is not provided or if an argument is not provided for it to randomly figure out a number for each of these types then it prompts the user for the value that should be used so what i'm going to do i'm going to go ahead and copy um let's see want to copy these remaining lines here and not do that all right and let's go ahead and do format to rearrange that so i want to do a if um and i guess we can specify the arguments here and what i like to do is when i do my arguments i have a function that handles the arguments and based on those functions it based on what arguments are set it defines some variables in here so i'm going to create a pra private not practice private static [Music] um we'll call it void for now and then we'll call it process arguments and we'll do a string of args and this is literally being called after the password generator so we want to do process arguments and we are literally passing in what is being passed into the main so this goes into our process arguments function from this uh we'll probably set some class level variables because um well let me write this function out here because i probably don't actually even need a i'll probably put it into a function after i get done with everything but to initially write all of this out is not necessary so what i want to do is loop over every argument that is being provided so i'm going to do a for each bar argument in args and then for uh so what we want to do is if argument is equal to and we'll do a double dash um now you can do a single dash or double dash i'm using a linux computer and normally when you're providing if you're doing shorthand you do a single dash if you're doing the long hand version of an argument you do a double dash and to further demonstrate that example so let's do a grep and dash h which is shorthand and so it gives you that but as you see here even in this shorthand help it says try grep with the double dash help for more information and so if i do double dash help it gives you a whole lot more output so um that's kind of the way you could do it so i could do it with the shorthand i could do it with the longer hand or i could do both um another example of this since we are coding in net core so dot net core dash h gives you the help information here and as you see here it has two options so it has the dash h for the shorthand and then the double dash help for the long hand same thing for diagnosis you got the dash d and double dash diagnosis so like i say i'm gonna i'm gonna do it with the double dash i can probably go back and code it later with the single dash as an option as well so this argument we want to do uh we'll call it random length and i guess we can go ahead and do the single option as well so if argument random length or argument is equal to dash r we'll just call it that for short all right then we want to do um i have a random down here so what i'm gonna do is actually move this up in the code and i'm going to put it here and that way i can leverage it within my for each so we want to do want to copy [Music] let's see so i need these four items as well so what i'm gonna do is delete these and copy and move these up here and so i will so we'll initialize them to zero um let's see formats there we go all right so we'll initialize them to zero and then in here if we got random length what i would do is do number of letters is equal to random and we want to set the min range um i'm going to define this as int and the mid range we'll set it to 3 [Music] and then on the same line do max range and we'll set it to six all right so that being said with mem range and max range um what i'm going to do with those values is set the range for the random so the minimum number and i may need to change this up a little bit for well i'll take that back out so let's do this so we want our password to be a minimum number of letters but we also want to have a maximum number of letters numbers and symbols usually not just letters so what i want to do is do random.next and um ideally we can use symbols in there but we want to have a minimum length so to get uh ideally from my experience systems have a minimum length of 8 characters as a password and a maximum length of like 20 or something like that nature so i want to do a combination that would be on the low end eight and on the high end let's say we'll actually go with 16 because 20 seems while that would be a more secure password 20 is kind of pushing the limit of a lot of systems so to get uh so we'll do next for so we'll do a min value and um we'll do eight on this one plus letters so next we'll do symbols random dot next and we'll do two and uh four and then of numbers random dot next is two and four see this right so four and four is i can highlight it correctly so 4 and 4 is 8 and 8 to 8 is 16 so we have our max of let's do this again all right so here we have 4 four and four is eight and then you have eight onto that so it max length of 16 on the minimum you have two two which is four and another four which is eight so it will pick a password between 8 and 16 characters if we have the random length argument specified all right the next thing we want to do is to specify the number of passwords and so in order to do that because right now the way it's currently set it will only generate one password per run so what i want to do is to expand this and so we'll say if argument is equal to um let's see really let me change the code up a little bit so what i think i want to do now to make this a little bit easier i'm going to do a switch statement instead of if condition you can do this with the if condition but i think once you get to a certain number of if statements it becomes more efficient to use a switch statement instead of an if statement so that's what i'm going to go ahead and switch so i'm going to take the same functionality up here and just move it and put it within a case so we'll do random length and then we'll do a another case statement with uh dash r and then we will paste our numbers and so forth here and then we'll do a break and then as always you'll want to specify a default condition even if there is nothing to do with in no action to actually do in that default condition i would always make it a habit of specifying it so then the next case will be a um we'll call it dash in and above that i'm going to do case and put a little bit more space in here so we'll do uh num uh we'll do count we'll call it count and then we'll do this as dash c that way it makes a little bit more sense and so we will want to do the and i have a process input function [Music] um i don't want to well i want to be able to use this logic here uh to make sure that it is an integer um but i don't want it to prompt so what i may do is for the time being i'm gonna copy this out of here and paste it back and then when i get to a point of refactoring i'll probably uh modify the code accordingly so that it does uh a more valid uh it doesn't right have the same code written in it more than once all right so we're not writing an input and we are taking the arguments um for this i actually need the argument plus one so uh i'm gonna have to get rid of this for statement and do it i equals zero i less than args dot length i plus plus and for this you want to do [Music] args i and if when we come down here so we want to do args i plus one and so what the what this will do is so if the current argument is da double dash count or dash c then we want to get the integer value specified with the the integer value specified after these arguments so that's where you get the arguments which is the current argument plus one which would be that specified number and then we want to convert that into an integer and then we want this to be um we want this to be a variable so that needs to be [Music] password gen count i guess or uh pass yeah password you can count is equal to zero and then we'll set password gen counts or set the out the number specified to password you can count assuming that it does not throw an exception if it does throw an exception [Music] um you don't need a break statement there if it does throw an exception you want the program to exit [Music] so see uh not sure how to do that here um so what i'm gonna do i know i want the program to exit if they throw an invalid argument so what i'm gonna do is actually just take out the try block for the time being until i have a little bit of a moment to go back and research that all right so just to recap what we've done thus far so we have a for loop and we can get rid of that statement i have a for loop that will loop through all of the arguments that have been provided and from here we'll have the each of those values for if you provide the random length argument we'll do this here if you provide the count it will do this here and we need to do one more um option here and so that case will be if dash h and then we'll also do another one here where the case is help because we want to provide some help output and so i want to call a function print help and do a break and then here we'll do control dots and we'll create a method called print help and if we go to that definition so this will be a combination of or well it will consist of not a combination of console write lines that output the usage so for example how we have here this long output for the net that's h similar in nature for that so what i'm gonna do is actually kind of mimic this so we'll go with on this first line usage and then we'll say um password [Music] generator t or spelling is critical and then um arguments that's on that line then another console right line and you could do this console.writeline as one long string uh to make it easier to manage and come to think of it i probably will just do that so let's take this back so we'll do a string of help outputs and we'll do that and then um let's see so we have that one there do that one plus that's not right um wait a minute yeah that's okay so i am missing a um a new line i think is that correct let's see console. no okay i'm getting my technologies mixed up here all right so to do that so slash r slash n and that's a difficult thing to type so what i'm gonna do is because that character turned it's a difficult thing to type i'm going to type a new line and put that there and then so that new line and if i do a semicolon here that error should oh i'm missing that at the end that error should go away there we go all right so we have that and then plus new line intellisense helps makes things a little bit easier all right so the next thing in this part so they have a description of what the application is so i'm going to call it generate a password with the new line rocket type there we go all right and then we'll do another blank new line plus new line all right the next one is runtime option so we have to provide our arguments so we have a um what do we have we have the uh dash h or whoops need to put it in quotation marks so dash h or that double dash help and provides um help out well we'll say displays this screen um i've seen this done before i know it's kind of a rudimentary way of what the help is but essentially that is what the help is is for it shows you the current screen all right the next one will be the dash r and i think that's what we called it dash r yeah r with random length and c with count all right so random length display uh generates passwords uh put that in parentheses of random length and then the last one is dash c with a count um generates one two three uh specified number of passwords there we go all right so after we do all that then we do help output and remove that last one now we could do uh formatting of this these here so that they tab up um kind of like how this is tabbed up but that's a little bit more advanced so i'm not going to get into that with this particular video um but what you could do it's a cheap uh like not necessarily cheap way but a quicker way of doing it is you space out everything so that it lines up here and then when you run that it will line up correctly all right so let's give this program a go and um actually need to do net run with i believe i can pass the arguments here um no okay so i need to let's do dot net build and once it builds all right so do clear and then cd bin debug net core app 3.1 and then do dot slash password generator double dash help and there we go so we have the help information here um now what should not happen it should not prompt you for that information there so we're going to have to fix that particular part um so where are we so we are here with the help um what i'm going to do is to actually move the remaining parts of the current main uh the current code in main and we will move this highlight the code use control dot and call uh extract method and then we'll say um password let's see um generate password that's a very good not well i mean that is what it's doing but probably not the best usage of that um all right so we'll go with uh generate password all right there we go so with this if um does not need to return that value all right so we'll also need to update this here and what's this needs to do is now so if we're generating the password then um this function needs to be called here as well as no take that back um so if we do a break uh okay this is an interesting setup that i got myself into um all right so outside of the for loop if the so it needs to go outside of the for loop because we want to go make sure that we go through all of the arguments and um if we do go through all the arguments and let's see if we probably need to set another value here and if help is so we'll do a boolean and call do help and set it to false and if come down here and if we print the help then set do help equal to true [Music] and if we did the help so if do help is equal to false then we run the generate password if it's equal to true we want to skip over that all right and so that will i think this will address that issue um as for these if let's see so we need to have so the random numbers at the random numbers so if all the random numbers are equal to zero then yeah so the random number is equal to zero we want to skip over the processing of the input so i'm just going to add if um really you don't have to check all of them because if one is equal to zero is not equal uh no if it's equal to zero then we want to prompt for all of the values because by default these uh variables will be zero all right and then i did it right yes all right so oh so that's the output variable i'm not sure why it specified it to be a oh i know why because we're passing it in but it doesn't need to be an out variable so let's change this these outs to just be variables passed in because what is happening is the it because i use the extract method thing it assumed that these would be out variables and would be reused in the main function but in this particular scenario that's not true all right so we're only checking the number of letters so um because we're only checking the num of letters uh yeah that should be sufficient all right so let's go back so we're here and we want to if we're just performing the help test then we want to skip over that um i know some people are you're probably watching this and be like why is he having set that equal to false well you could also do this because i know some people prefer to do this with their code and it's essentially the same thing but my personal preference is when you're doing these type of statements um it's very easy in some programming languages this one net core not necessarily being one of them but it's very easy to see what i have highlighted here as a single variable instead of an exclamation point with a variable next to it so i try to refrain from doing that and i prefer to write my when i have these type of conditions i prefer to write it equal to false to make it clearly evident that you are looking for a false condition here instead of this uh exclamation with a variable name which is basically a not statement so if do help is not equal to true which is basically saying if do help is equal to false um so you know i try to avoid what is known as uh i think it's called like an inverse condition um that's one of the if i recall correctly is mentioned in rob robert martin's uh clean code book about using inverse conditional statements because the logic behind it is kind of confusing like you can see it and process it when you're actually trying to process your you know think your way through it uh it can be rather confusing to uh process and try to get correct so now that i've done with that spill all right so everything else should be working as it should so if you come back here and do uh i don't know if i can do net build from this directory and i can't all right so we'll go back to the password generator and do net build and i'm going to do is open a new tab in my ssh session and then we'll go to that build directory so dotnet bin all the way down dot slash password generator double slash help and there we go and then if i do a uh dash h it should give me the same output and it does so we know that the help screen is working the way it should be [Music] um yeah there we go all right so the next part is to [Music] we're going to double check your logic right quick and then try to run this and see what happens when we run it um so just to make sure so we have our number of letters all being set so we have here the number of letters is equal to zero but because we're giving it random values if the argument is passed this should never equal zero um it well all of these should never equal zero but in specific specifically we're checking the number of letters because that's the one that we're just only checking um you could write this if condition to check each one of these values to make sure that they're not equal to zero but because of what we have here if the number of letters is not equal to zero it is very unlikely unless something you know uh memory exception or something else occurs that these other two variables would be zero and even if then that something like a memory exception would occur it would throw that exception and probably wouldn't even execute these last two statements um when generating those random values so the rest of this code wouldn't even run all right that being said um the other thing we need to do is to have uh so let's set password drink out to one because not a think about it the you want this to run at least one time um and so if i do this here so a for statement and i want to ant equal zero while i mean excuse me not it um let's call this so we got password gen count uh there let's see we'll stick with i i don't think i have an i in this i do have an i in this so i can't use i well nope i'm sorry so this i is for that loop so i can do i here again um so if i equals zero i less than uh password gen counts and i plus plus and then we want to do the generate password and do format and also do trim real quick all right and so just to recap so when if a user passes in the argument of double dash count or dash c we wanted to convert this to a n32 and what i'm gonna do here is so i'm gonna re-enable this try catch and we'll say invalid input and what will happen here is we'll default the password gen count to one if an exception occurs and i'm gonna do the same thing here um could i have put this statement here in a finally block yes um am i going to do that no because then i'll have to have a condition that will check to see if the password jan is equal to one or greater than one and that's a little bit extra code so it's easier just to drop it and set this value here that if you have an exception of if you throw an exception then just default it to one and that ensures that even if the value that you're typing in for the count is mistyped or uh if if it's not an integer or if it is a it's not entered like if you type the argument but don't type the secondary argument with it that it is caught um and i guess the other thing with this is to also catch i guess a general exception with this particular value because i'm not um i think it's argument null uh or argument exception i'm not sure which one it is so we're gonna go to an argument exception for this and when we test it if it doesn't work the way you would think it would work then [Music] we'll just handle it accordingly and still set it to one that way it will be it won't cause any other issues um and we'll say error occurred because most users don't understand exceptions but they do understand error um so i'm gonna type that there error and then do uh open brace zero close brace with ex dot message as the value to replace the zero placeholder here and we're still going to set that to the password account to one that way we still get a password even if we throw an exception um all right this looks like it is ready to go uh the rest of the logic for actually generating the password is not changed um we just added other things around it to process or you know address what needs to be done and that being said let's go back to the console and we'll do another net build on this console tab all right bill succeeded so let's clear the screen and i'm going to do dot slash password generator and this time i'm going to pass in uh let's see we're going to do a dash r and so it should just give me there we go so it works so we have it generating a random password and i can do this as many times as i want as you see here the length of the password is changing uh each time this these two times they got the same length which is still acceptable um this one is a little bit longer if you kind of draw a line straight down you'll see that it doesn't quite hit and this one is clearly shorter uh i think this one is actually this one is the minimum length of eight characters as you see one two three four and then five six seven eight all right so the next thing is to try out the count and so we'll do dash r c and we'll give it a count of five so this time we should get five passwords there we go and so we have our five passwords and they're all the same length um and i think that has to do with the random generator uh because the random function when you initialize it it i if i'm not mistaken it uses the current time to get a random value um so that is probably playing a part in the length of the password um well i'll take that back no because we're actually setting so we're setting the random link in the beginning and because it's set in a random length in the beginning that means when it does that count then it's going to do that each time okay so what may needs what may uh let's see so let's change some of the logic here so that we get a different password length each time that we do multiple passwords uh so what i want to do is actually to move this um so we're going to move this to a method uh control dots extract method and we'll do we'll leave that there and we'll rename this new method to get random links l-e-n-g-t-h-s there we go all right and so if we go to the definition of that it will set the it will get the random lengths and then return those back to their respective values but that function does not need to go here it needs to actually go down here in our four and so we want to do if random lengths is equal not the function call come on l-e-n-g-t-h-s is equal to well we'll just leave it there so it is understood that if that is true then we want to do this function call and set that here and then we need to define this as a [Music] need um generate a variable and we'll call it a not a property it's not a parameter or is it a no it's not a parameter so it's a it's not a field either okay um not seeing what i wanted to see so we'll do bool random lengths is equal to false and then here we will set random lengths is equal to true and not double equals that's comparison operator all right that should work there and then so when we come down here if get random lengths is yeah so this is true then it will get the random lanes and then we will get random values for our passwords each time so let's go ahead and do a build and if we come back over to our console and do a run with five passwords all right and so now we're getting five passwords with different links as you see here yeah so we're getting five passwords with different links and that's what you should get out of a random ising function [Music] let's see are there any other scenarios that we want to test so we're getting five so let's see what happens if we do the r without let me excuse me do the c without the r all right and so um because we're not doing random passwords but we are doing the count it will prompt five times all right so it gave that password and so it's going to ask again five times how many uh letters do you want in your password and then we'll just keep going all right and so it asked us five times how many letters would we like in our password this does work but i do not see a use case for just this dash c5 option but i'm going to leave it in there just in case um you know i may have a use case for it i don't foresee a use case for it but it is useful to have it now that we've done that let's go back and demonstrate the full values excuse me the full length name of the arguments so we're going to do the same function with the double dash random length as being passed in as an argument and there we go so we can confirm that that works and then if we do just dash r we can also see that that works and then if we do the same thing before with a with the count fully specified you'll see here we get our five passwords with the arguments the full length excuse me the full name of the arguments being specified here too so i believe this works the way that it uh is intended um it's still saying your password is for each of these what could be done is if you are specifying the if an argument count is greater than zero you could possibly trim this out that way you know uh is being you want the program to run in kind of a headless type mode [Music] but i'm not going to do that right now that may be a future enhancement to this uh coding challenge and so you're probably asking well what happens if you don't pass any arguments so let's go ahead and try that option as well and as you see it works as it did in the original coding challenge where it asks you how many of each that you want and then it spits out a password in the end so that will wrap things up for this particular video uh this uh i'll continue to add on to these existing coding challenges that i've done so that you

The reason that those challenges were being posted in the group was so that those learning Python would have a reason to gain some practice. After all, those challenges were targeted for Python programmers. I took it upon myself to participate in these challenges, but instead of doing them in Python, I did them in C#.</p> <p>Why would I do a challenge in a language other than what was asked? I should be doing the challenge in the language asked so that I can expand my skillset right? Not necessarily. In 2019, I had an interview. The interviewer said that he knew that I could code based on me solving the coding problem that I had did in the interview and my skills listed in my resume. However, he offered me some career advice and said that because my skills were in a number of languages and technologies, that I should narrow it down and be more of a specialist instead of knowing a lot of languages.

so that value does exist it will put the it as the jumbotron and the only thing is i'll just have to make sure that there are not two pages in here that have the feature tag as the jumbotron uh i mean excuse me there are not two pages that have the featured uh meta attribute set and that should be fairly difficult to do just got to make sure you got to remember what's there and remove the other one so i'm going to say feature true it could be yes it could be one whatever value goes there because they're not going to actually display the value we're just putting a value there so that it knows that something needs to be shown there all right and so here we have our one piece of content here now let's go back to the page here and we're going to actually change the title and we're going to say nav child i'm going to nav child title and actually need to put that in braces title and i want to also put in the link to this particular page so we're going to do nav child dot url we're going to pipe that to url which is a special filtering mechanism that is used in the ninja templating engine and then for this one i'm going to actually use the um i'm actually going to make this an if condition here and what i want to do is actually put in the description for this page so we're going to take that out and we're going to check to see if the uh actually don't need two braces we just need one if nav child dot description excuse me now that meta dot description then you're going to display the dab child dot meta dot description and if there is nothing else there then we're going to do what was done down here with the truncating of the nav child content and i need to close this out so do and if with the parentheses there all right now here we have it and it's working correctly so we have the title of our post as well as the description of said post and how we're triggering that is again in the content we have a true flag in the meta here for featured and so with that there anytime that flag is there it will show true so the only thing is you just got to make sure that you don't have it set in that featured meta attribute in multiple places otherwise you will get multiple jumbotrons showing on the home page all right and to check the link so it does point to the red mountain park post and and going down you'll see at the top of the page here we actually have the post show the title of the page showing up twice and that's something i'm gonna have to fix next so if we go back to the this particular section here and here we have the page title and what it's doing is actually the page title is in the body content or the page content of that page and so what's happening is it's pulling the title and saying okay i see the title but then i'm posting it again because it's in the content or the body of the page and that's how we are getting this double page heading so what i need to do is actually to put a condition in here so that this does not happen and what i need to do is to actually so we need a if condition and um so i'm actually going to surround this block here and the reason being i'm going to do it this way is because if the page title is not in the metadata then it's going to show up in the body and what will happen is that actually will show up kind of weird in nature on the page so i want to actually enclose all of that into a single block that if the title is in the page itself and not in the metadata that is not showing all of this and coming out with a weird output like this the long-term fix would be to actually go back and correct the content that is set up this way so that we don't have that problem going forward but right now i'm gonna go ahead and code this fix in as i want to be able to show you all how to do this on your particular setup what we're going to check is if the page dot meta dot title attribute does exist and [Music] we want to do page dot meta dot title and then we also want to show the metadata and i'm putting all of that the h2 and everything else in here inside like this for a on purpose um really this actually should also come think of it should be a h1 not an h2 because it is the page title so now that i've corrected that i'm going to go ahead and get this to correct that and i have saved the page so if we go back and refresh it let's see did i mistype something oh so i have the title here as well as that so what i need to do is also make another condition in here that will uh if the metadata title is present and [Music] i guess that's that yeah what i actually need to do is just remove it here from the page and that should correct that issue that with the title showing twice and as you see it has now what i was talking about earlier is let's put that back temporarily and remove this one and it should now not show the credits and it doesn't as you see it just only shows the title and that's what i want it to do all right so let's remove this and we also need to [Music] change this to posted i like to also have updated on here updated 2020 what's today 20 20 uh 09.06 is the current date and time and if we go back to here so we have the posted date and time and then i also want to include the updated date and time because sometimes you'll write a post but then that posts you something in that post is incorrect or the data in there has changed or something of that nature and if that's the case i want to make those necessary updates so i'm going to do if condition meta dot uh updated so past tense and then i want to do similar to how i have the above element with the posted date so page.meta.updated and then do a closing and if on this the jinjo2 template does have a date time available in here where you can do a filtering of a time pattern i don't do that but if you wanted to you could do that and i'm also going to put updated here so that you clearly know that this is the updated time and i want to put yeah okay so if the updated time updated date rather that's been provided then there it is all right and let's see i think that is sufficient so should be good so here we have the date posted by who yours truly and updated on today at the time of this recording and so here's that full post that you have there all right so let's go back to the home page so we have our featured content up here which is pretty great and we have our list of posts down here um i actually think i want to get rid of this sidebar and probably actually move this to a separate page that way i have a single column website that is capable of well it's already bootstrapped so it can already resize for any type of device that is being used for but i wanted to be able to have a single column website that way it's less to manage because when you have the sidebars over here it's somewhat a little bit more complex but not severely complex bootstrap makes it a little bit easier to deal with that being said i'm going to actually move so we can move this elsewhere block down to the bottom of the page so let's go and grab this content block here or this div and i want to move it within the nav so here's the closing div for the main navigation section or excuse me the main page body and i'm going to take this class off because i don't well i'm going to leave that class there and i want to actually add a horizontal row here class uh call it order border danger i believe is what i'm looking for here with this one and let's see if we get a red line there yes so now that i have that there i can actually go and take these two blocks off the side and just comment that section and i actually need to let's move that down a line and now see there we go comment that section almost not quite okay i guess because i have the commented section in the middle that when i try to hit the shortcut it's not liking it so much so now that we have that out of the way we need to actually come up here and change the div on this container [Music] to take up the full width of the screen and there you have it all right now if i have some additional blocks i can drop these down here at the bottom if i choose which is what i think i'm gonna do i'm actually going to uh spaces out and put a bg we'll go with light on this one just to see how it looks and i'm probably going to do a empty div [Music] between the main and go back to class with a i believe it's a margin if not is padding to get kind of a gap yeah and it's kind of difficult to see let me change that to vg dark so you can see it a little bit better all right so you see there's white space in between the x the footer and then this next block or section of the page another thing about it i don't like that red line there if i have this darker background here and so that will get things through this particular page i mean excuse me this particular section um the next thing that i'm gonna have to do is actually go back through and check the links on the page and the reason being is because i move the content around that's kind of more of a manual process you could write a shell script that would be able to handle that and i may actually end up doing that in this case um but it's a little bit more difficult to do and whatnot and so i want to test out the bootstrap part of this where it may show where it will resize and as you see it's resizing pretty well and let's open this back out all right so for the there was a nav section up here at the top that was commented out earlier i'm actually go ahead and bring it back okay not sure what i did all right so here we go so let's try to bring this back and in case you're wondering i actually use visual studio at uh sometimes and so as you see me typing this some of the shortcuts in visual studio are slightly different than those in visual studio code and so you'll see the screen randomly jump is because i actually hit the wrong shortcut and so it's doing something completely different than what i intended um just know i'm not just messing up things on purpose here all right so next i'm going to disable some of this stuff here for right now and i'm going to actually go ahead and change some of these uh links that are here so go about and do contact on this one and just as a helpful tip if you do not have about or contact pages on your website google will actually penalize you for the lack of those pages because it considers those two pages to be critical for every website again about and contact pages are critical for every website according to google that being said create them even if you don't have a lot of content on them you need to create them and have links to them from pretty much any page on the site because as google crawls the site it will look for those pages and if you're trying to come up in the blogging world those two pages and seo will be a critical factor in what you are able to get in terms of seo rankings as you see i don't have any contact on i mean content on my contact or any content on my about pages i will be fixing that but not in the video all right and if i wanted to add other categories or sections to the site i could do that i'll probably go back and tweak this so that i have pages for each category and have them to be able to be accessed from the navigation bar up here as you see but right now the remaining text will remain there it'll just be commented out and i really want to i don't want to have this justified with the content in between i really want it centered so i'm going to change this to text center and if i come back uh looks like i got the wrong bootstrap [Music] class is it centered i believe it might be center oh okay uh a line item center maybe that's what it all right so yeah justify okay it looks like i'm missing i have somewhere i thought i had it maybe i don't okay let me go look back into other code and see this is one of the main reasons that you want to be able to keep your existing code so text center does exist okay maybe it's just not working for this this is one of the main reasons you want to be able to keep your existing code and be able to reference your existing code because sometimes you may make a mistake like this or you know have some uncertainty like this and it's still justifying which i'm not sure why and it might be because of this flexboxes here and that's fine i will just remove that for now um well worst case scenario you can go to the bootstrap website and reference the information that they have there about the classes and so forth so if you go to documentation text alignment is what i am looking for and text center is the correct thing that i should be using but for reasons that i don't understand um and it might again might be because of this d flex let's see what happens with that if i take that out and take this out and replace it with the text center all right so it's still justifying to the left and if i do margin auto margin x auto i believe this is okay still not doing what i wanted to do that's fine i will actually just undo this for the time being because i do have these other links that i also want to leverage in here so it'll be fine if i put those more links in there but right now with it spaced out you know all the way across the screen like that it's kind of a looks kind of weird that you got those two links so far apart from each other all right and let's see what else can we do so i do want to monetize this site what i will do is i will put another block down here i'm not going to do that on video because of the amount of stuff i had to go through to get to the monetization code but it essentially would be another block that goes down here on the page or even at the bottom of the page here that you can put a ad banner there if you have a blog i do recommend suggesting monetizing your blog and that way you're able to make some money you may not make a lot of money off of it but you are making some money off the content that you are creating however if you're not interested in monetization don't worry about it but it's an easy way to make a little bit of passive income you know even if you're only getting five bucks a month five bucks can probably get you a lunch or a snack or something you know for your efforts and your knowledge sharing and it's also kind of uh in my opinion a good way of using that to your advantage because you're able to the more the more content that you create that is useful to the community whichever community you're in whether you're in technology whether you're in gardening the more content that you create and the more people you bring to your site the more money you get in return because of that and so i just kind of see it as a positive picture for that so in the end i'm going to go ahead and close out this series if you want to check out the sites once i finish everything completely completely like the bulk of the work is done if you want to see final tweaks and so forth that i've done you can go check out this particular blog it'll be a link down in the description below this blog is hosted on my github page or github on my github pages and you can check it out you can also look at the finalized template that source code will also be available in the uh almost encr.github.io repository again the link to that will be down in the description below hopefully you have good success in building your site out and i've given you some insight into how to build a template using mk docs with the ninja templating engine if you have any questions

Since the tech field is very wide,  the options that the individuals that I have spoke with have different paths. Thus it is still difficult to give them a trajectory or guidance on how to progress to achieving their career goals.</p> <p>Some do not have an answer to this question. They just know that a lot of people make good money in tech and they want in on the money.  Problem with this line of thinking is that some want to chase the money and not have a career objective. When you chase the money and not the objective, it shows up in other areas.  You lack knowledge that similar individuals have acquired and are well versed in.  You lack drive to make yourself a better candidate for the job you desire.  All this lack shows up in the lack of skill and experience. This why they have a hard time breaking into tech.  This leads me to tell people to find out what they want to do in tech. Once you discover that, then getting into tech will be easier. Reason being is that a network engineer doesn't necessarily need to know the same stuff as a Linux administrator. </p>"},{"location":"technology/2022.02.02-breaking-into-tech/#presenters-about-breaking-into-tech","title":"Presenters About Breaking Into Tech","text":"<p>One of the presenters drew the diagram on the board and elaborated on how to get into tech.

It also depends on the type of filament that  you are using to print with. There are two different temperatures that you have to keep in mind.  The extruder temperature and the bed temperature. The extruder temperature is the temperature that the  print head needs to be to turn the filament from a solid to a liquid and create the object that you are attempting to make. The plate temperature is what your printing will sit on as it is being printed. This  is critical because too low of a plate temp the print wont stick to the plate or will move around during printing and too high of a temperature means that what you printed may not properly cure.  </p>"},{"location":"technology/2022.02.24-got-a-3d-printer-now-what/#make-and-model","title":"Make and Model","text":"<p>The printer that we received was a Sainsmart Ender 3.

Each programming project will have different requirements, and as a result,  will vary in what is needed to meet the project goals. </p> <p>I will say this, there are times where a standard should not be done or applied. There are times when they  should. Based on the technology, framework, and design pattern, it is best to do the strategy that fits  the situation instead of saying to never do something or making blanket statements about  programming concepts.</p>"},{"location":"uses/","title":"Uses","text":""},{"location":"uses/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Browsing around on GitHub, I found that developers create \"uses\" (or /uses) pages that detail the tools that they use do their work.
