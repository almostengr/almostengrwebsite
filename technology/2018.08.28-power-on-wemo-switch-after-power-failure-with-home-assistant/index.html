When a power failure occurs, the Wemo switch will default to the Off state. I'm using the Wemo switch to be able to remotely restart the router if I have internet connection issues. A power failure recently occurred before shooting this video. This resulted in the internet connection being down until I was able to return home and turn on the switch. By having Home Assistant switch on the modem after all connections and power has been restored, I don't have to worry about not being able to access my network remotely after a power failure. Video If you have comments or questions about the video, please leave them on the video's YouTube page.", "copyright": "" }
