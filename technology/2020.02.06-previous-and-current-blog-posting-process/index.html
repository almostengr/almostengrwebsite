Here are some of the main reasons for making the switch: Drupal 7 has been replaced with Drupal 8. That means the content would need to be migrated to the new platform. However, all the functionality may not be available, as some modules are still being converted to work on Drupal 8. Blogging with a static site puts you at less risk of hacking, encountering database issues, and page load speed. I discuss this further in another post weighing the pros and cons of switching. Old Process with Drupal Login to Drupal Had to login to Drupal each time that I wanted to make an update to my blog. This mean that I was less likely to make that update over public WiFi, because public WiFi means that your site could be a greater risk for being hacked. Ignore that Message About Security Updates Available Now I did not always ignore this message, but majority of the time I did. Why? Because when the thought of a new content came to mind, I wanted to get as much of the thought out of my head and onto digital paper as possible. Fooling around and trying to get those updates installed before getting the thoughts out meant that I would risk loosing the thought, thus no new content. On the other prospective, not getting those security updates in place would leave the site at risk. Write The Content... In A Word Processor I know it does not make sense, but let me explain. While some browsers do have spell check, I have not ran across one that has grammar check. That said, I know that I make mistakes typing and have to go back and correct those mistakes. However, I would rather to get it right the first time than to have to correct it in a future update or somebody telling me about my mistake. Move the Content to the Website Once I have done all the grammar and spell checking in the word processor, I would then copy and paste that content into the website and preview it. With previewing, it would allow me to see that the content was formatted correctly before publishing. Once I would confirm that all was well, then I would publish the content. Take a Backup Since things could go wrong with Drupal when performing the database updates, per the Drupal documentation, it was recommended that you always backed up the database before running the database updates function. I have had a few sites go wrong when performing the database updates and it was not easy getting them back online since I did not have recent backups. In some of the modules, the maintainers were not using database transactions in their update functions. So if part of the update ran and failed, you would have a partial-ran database update but Drupal would see it as if the full update had completed successfully. Problem with Drupal seeing it as the full update running, is that it would not let you re-run that specific update again. So that meant that you had to either tinker in the database and manually update the version number to the previous version so that the database update could be ran again or restore the database with the backup and run the update again. Either of those options were not ideal and definitely were time consuming. Those Security Updates If I was using the right computer, I would then download the available security updates into my development computer. Confirmed that nothing blew up in the process with Drupal's database updater. Then commit those updates to my website's version control. Then pull the latest version into my production environment and run Drupal's database updater and prayed the entire time that things would work as they should. New Process with MkDocs Fetch Latest Repo On any computer of my choosing that has git installed, I can get the latest the latest version of Markdown code of my website and make updates to it. Edit in Text Editor or Word Processor Since the content that I am going to edit is already on the computer, I do not have to do anything special to get them into a word processor for editing. It is just as simple as File > Open > select the file > start typing. Save and Commit Once I have made all of the edits that need to be made, I can save my changes in the word processor and then commit them to my version control. Then push that branch up to the origin. Generate Static Files and Deploy I have my development environment set up with MkDocs. So I login to that server and run the git pull command followed by mkdocs gh-deploy command. The static HTML, CSS, and JS files are generated and committed to a local branch and then I am prompted to enter by GitHub credentials. Automated Pull in Production My production instance has a cronjob set up that does a pull of the branch that contains the static website. It does this pull several times per day. In a sense, it it like having a CD (continuous deployment) set up in that environment. Future Considerations Expanded CI-CD Setup One of the future goals that I have is to expand my current deployment set up so that it will periodically pull the master branch and automatically run the gh-deploy command on it. I looked into having all of this done in my production environment, but my website host provider will not allow me to install Python packages on their shared server. Thus will have to continue to generate the static website files locally. GitHub Actions GitHub Actions allows you to do testing and deployment when an event occurs on your repository. For example, if you push code from your remote to the origin, GitHub Actions can be triggered to run tests on the operating system of your choosing with whatever else is required to complete the testing (Python install, PHP install, etc). Based upon what I currently have in place, it seems to be the more viable option. I already have a script that runs in my production environment that periodically pulls the static website pages. Thus I never have to login to production to deploy my website. Conclusion As you can see from the details provided, switching blogging platforms means less maintenance required on the operations side of the blog and allows me to spend more time creating content.", "copyright": "" }
