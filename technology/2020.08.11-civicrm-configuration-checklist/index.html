id=transcript-unedited>Transcript (Unedited)</h2> <p>WHAT'S GOING ON FELLOW ENGINEERS THANKS TO YOU FOR CHECKING OUT THIS VIDEO AND IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST IN YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLATION ON WORDPRESS HERE WE GO <em>Music</em> ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK SO IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS VIDEO SERIES OF ME MOVING MY WEBSITE OVER TO WORDPRESS YOU'VE SEEN THAT THE PROGRESSION THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO AS FAR AS CONVERTING THE EXISTING SITE OVER IT'S A WORDPRESS MOVING CONTENT AND SO FORTH ONE FEATURE I WANT TO ADD IS TO HAVE A MAILING LIST FUNCTIONALITY ON MY WEBSITE AND SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO USE CP CRM I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING WHY DID I NOT USE LIKE A MAILCHIMP OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF SERVICE THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE I DID THINK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO WHEN YOU'RE USING THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES ONE OF WHICH IS COST SO USUALLY THERE IS A THRESHOLD OF ONCE YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU HAVE TO START PAYING ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR DATA AND SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT ANY GIVEN POINT AND SAY WELL TO PAY TO GET YOUR DATA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW SO IT'S EASIER TO COME OUT HOST YOUR OWN THINGS USING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M USING SEVERE CRM FOR THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE SO AS I DISCUSSED IN LAST VIDEO SEVERE CRM IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE SOME USE CASES FOR STUFF OUTSIDE OF A NONPROFIT ARENA ALL RIGHT SO SWITCHING OVER TO THE COMPUTER I DID INSTALL SUPER CRM IN MY LAST VIDEO SO IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THAT GO BACK AND WATCH THAT THERE WILL BE A PLAYLIST TO ALL THE VIDEOS OF THIS WEBSITE CONVERSION SERIES DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW SO WHEN YOU GO INTO CIVIC CRM FROM THE DASHBOARD THERE IS A OPTION TO DO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND SO YOU CLICK THAT IT BRINGS YOU TO A LIST OF ITEMS ON YOUR CIVI CRM INSTALLED AND SO WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS WHEN I'M SETTING UP A CIVIC CRM INSTALLATION I START FROM THE TOP AND JUST WORK MY WAY DOWN AND MAKE SURE I HIT EVERY SCREEN EVEN IF I'M NOT CHANGING ANY SCREENS I JUST MAKE SURE I JUST GO DOWN A LIST AND COVER EVERYTHING BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS LIST I BUY - I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR SCREEN BUT IT'S THERE SO I'M GONNA START FROM THE TOP WE HAVE LOCALIZATION ALRIGHT AND SO HERE WE SET THE LANGUAGE I'M GONNA CHANGE THIS DEFAULT EXCUSE ME INHERITS EMS LANGUAGE WHICH IS CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - YES AND THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE WILL SET THAT AS A SITE LANGUAGE AS WELL CURRENCY I AM IN THE UNITED STATES SO I WANT TO USE USD AND I'M GONNA LEAVE THE AVAILABLE ONES - USD I'M NOT SURE HOW WILL THEN WILL CONVERT BUT YOU KNOW IF I'M USING SOME KIND OF PAYMENTS I BELIEVE PAYPAL WILL HANDLE THAT PRETTY WELL SO NO CONCERN IS THERE MY DEFAULT COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES SO I'M GOING TO SET THAT THERE AND THE DEFAULT PROVINCE I BELIEVE THAT ONE BLANK FOR THE CONTACT ADDRESS FIELD SO I WANT TO DO THE AVAILABLE COUNTRIES ARE CANADA AND GOING TO DO UNITED STATES OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO DO THE COUNTRY THAT YOUR HAND AND SPACE AND PROMISES YOU GOT TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THOSE SO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES AND YOU'RE ABLE TO JUMP AROUND HERE BY USING THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THAT BUT LIKE I WANTED TO GO TO A COUNTRY THAT STARTED WITH L I JUST TYPE SELECT AND CHECK IN THE BOX AND THEN HIT L ON THE KEYBOARD AND YOU CAN EVEN TYPE OUT THE NAME IN HERE AND IT'LL JUMP DOWN TO THAT ALRIGHT AND ENABLE MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I WILL IN DUE TIME BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY ALRIGHT THE NEXT THING IS THE ORGANIZATION ADDRESS AND CONTACT INFORMATION SO THIS IS LIKE I SAY IT IS DESIGNED FOR NONPROFITS THE OXYGENATOR OKAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR LIKE YOU KNOW BUILT BUSINESSES THAT I'M SORRY I'LL PUT THE WRONG THING THERE ONCE YOU PUT A MAIN STREET HERE AND A CITY AND MAKE UP A ZIP CODE AND THERE ARE NO COUNTIES FOR THE UNITED STATES I DON'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY HAS CREATED A COMPONENT FOR THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE COUNTIES FOR OTHER LOCATIONS MORE SO OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE I AM THIS WILL BE BLANK AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE ORGANIZATION CONTACT INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW EMAIL ADDRESS EAR AND IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENSION PUT THAT IN THERE AND SO THAT INFORMATION WILL ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN THE EMAILS THAT YOU SEND OUT ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST IS THE ENABLE CIVIC CRM COMPONENTS I AM ONLY GOING TO BE USING MAIL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS EVENTS GRANTS PLEDGES CASES REPORTS AND CAMPAIGNS I WON'T ELABORATE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT WHICH EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BEANS IN THEIR FUNCTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO TO SEE PCRM ORG AND READ UP ON THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THERE ABOUT THAT SO I'M ONLY USING MAIL AND REPORT SO I'M GONNA JUST GO AHEAD AND SAVE ALL RIGHT AND SO REGISTER YOUR SITE SO CIVIC CRM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THEIR MODULE OR SO SO YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE MAILING LISTS AND THAT THEY NOTIFY YOU OF WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING I'VE ALREADY DONE IT SO I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU IT TAKES YOU THROUGH THEIR SITE AND IT'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU THERE ALL RIGHT THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY PREFERENCES AND SO WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FIELDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WELL AS TABS I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M GOING TO UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING SO LIKE CONTRIBUTIONS MEMBERSHIPS TAGS I'LL LEAVE THAT CHECK EVENTS CASES GRANTS PLEDGES I'M NOT USING I WILL LEAVE MAILINGS CHECKED AS WELL AND SO THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE VIEWING A CONTACT WHEN YOU ARE EDITING A CONTACT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF FIELDS AS WELL THAT CAN BE USED I'M GONNA LEAVE THOSE SELECTED FOR NOW I MAY CHANGE IT AT A LATER POINT WHEN GOING TO DO A SEARCH FOR A CONTACT YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF CRITERIA HERE THAT YOU SEE I LIKE I SAID I'M NOT USING ALL OF THIS STUFF SO I'M UNCHECK WHAT I'M NOT USING THIS RELATES TO THE CONTACT SEARCH AND THE CONTACT DASHBOARD AGAIN I'M GOING TO UNCHECK SOME OF THIS STUFF HERE BECAUSE I AM NOT USING IT ALL RIGHT CIVIC CRM ALSO DOES HAVE A WYSIWYG EDITOR BUILT INTO IT THAT'S JUST SELECTING SETTING THAT AND THE DISPLAY NAME OF EACH PERSON IS ALREADY CONFIGURED IN HERE BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I BELIEVE THE THEME THE WAY IT IS YOU CAN SET IT TO A DIFFERENT THING BUT LEAVE IT AS IS ALRIGHT NEXT IS ADDRESS SETTINGS AND SO IT HAS THE ADDRESS AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULTED TO THE COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN BUT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT OTHER DETAILS IN HERE USING THESE TOKENS OR TAKE THESE SOME OF THESE DETAILS OUT I AM GOING TO UNCHECK LATITUDE BECAUSE I HAVE NO NEED FOR LATITUDE AND I'LL LEAVE I'LL UNCHECK COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT TRACKING THE COUNTY IN HERE AND IF YOU WANT TO USE A ADDRESS STANDARDIZATION PROVIDER YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IN YOUR CREDENTIALS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM THEM THIS LINK HERE WILL TAKE YOU THERE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH SETTING THAT PART UP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT SO I'MA LEAVE IT BLANK NEXT IS MAPPING IN GEOCODING SO IF YOU'RE TRACKING ADDRESSES YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THESE MAPPING PROVIDERS HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THE SETUP IT'LL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A KEY AND YOU CAN PUT THAT KEY IN HERE AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING THOSE ADDRESSES YOU CAN PULL UP THAT CONTACTS INFORMATION HERE AND IT WILL SHOW YOU ON A MAP WHERE THAT ADDRESS THAT THAT CONTACT HAS IS LOCATED IN THE WORLD AGAIN I'M NOT USING THAT IT'S JUST I'M ONLY DOING SENDING OUT EMAILS FROM HERE NEXT IS THE SEARCH PREFERENCES SO PRETTY MUCH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY IN HERE I NEED TO CHANGE SO ALL OF THE DEFAULTS ARE FINE BUT BASICALLY THIS ICON UP HERE IS SEARCHES AND YOU CAN CHANGE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR JUST BY SELECTING IT ALL RIGHT SO NICKNAMED A PAGE ORDER QUICK SEARCH OPTIONS I'LL LEAVE THOSE AS IS AND TIM RESULTS ALL RIGHT SO I'M GONNA JUST SAVE IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING I ALWAYS MAKE IT A HABIT OF WHEN I EXIT OUT TO SAVE JUST IN CASE I DO CHANGE SOMETHING THEY FORGET ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ONE IS THE MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS SO CONTRACT CONTACT TRASH AND UNDELETE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT AT YES THAT WAY IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY DELETE SOMETHING YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TRASH AND RESTORE IT DON'T NEED TO DO ANY LOGGING AND I DON'T WANT TO ATTACH PDFS TO THE RECEIPTS THAT MAKE YOUR EMAILS UNNECESSARILY BIGGER AND ALSO MORE LOAD ON YOUR SERVER IF YOU'RE GENERATING LETTERS LIKE IN BATCHES YOU CAN HAVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE THAT HERE I'D RATHER HAVE ONE PER CONTACT SO THAT'S FINE AND THESE ARE OTHER SETTINGS RELATED TO VARIOUS THINGS LIKE SENDING EMAILS AND SO FORTH AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS RECAPTCHA ON HERE IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU CAN PUT THAT IN HERE THAT IT WILL BETTER PROTECT THE FORMS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR SITE OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE AN ERROR HERE SO I BELIEVE MY MAX PHP AND MY EXCUSE ME MAX UPLOAD SIZE AND MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS SET TO 2 MEGABYTES SO I NEED TO CHANGE THAT I ORIGINALLY HAD 3 HERE WHICH WAS THE DEFAULT ALL RIGHT SO NEXT IS THE CONTACT TYPES SO BY DEFAULT THERE ARE THREE CONTENT TYPES BUILT-IN ORGANIZATION HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL DEPENDING ON YOUR USE CASE YOU CAN TURN THESE OFF AND AND OR AB OR OR DELETE THESE THAT ARE HERE FOR RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO DELETE THOSE THAT ARE HERE BUT I AM GOING TO EXCUSE ME DISABLE THOSE NOT DELETE THOSE THAT ARE HERE AND THAT WAY I'LL JUST STICK WITH THE CORE CONTACT TYPES I MAY A LATER DATE AND MORE TYPES HERE BUT FOR NOW JUST HAVING INDIVIDUALS AND HERE IS SUFFICIENT ALL RIGHT SO I'M DONE WITH THAT LET ME GO BACK TO THE CONFIGURATION PAGE ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE DONE CONTENT TYPES NEXT IS THE FROM EMAIL ADDRESS SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE SET WHEN YOU'RE SENDING OUT MAILING LISTS EMAILS THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD SET THAT INFORMATION I'M ASSERTED TO NO REPLY YOU KNOW MOST ENGINEER COMM ALL RIGHT AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT A DESCRIPTION IN HERE YOU CAN ORDER AND WHETHER IT'S THE DEFAULT OPTION ALRIGHT SO THAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA GO BACK THIS TIME TO THAT CHECKLIST BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT SAVE ME TO THE WRONG PLACE OKAY ALL RIGHT OUTBOUND EMAIL SO HERE IS WHERE YOU WOULD SET WHETHER TO SEND EMAIL USING SMTP SO IF YOU'RE WANTING TO USE A GMAIL ADDRESS YOU CAN USE THE SMTP INFORMATION YOU CAN USE THE SMTP OPTION AND THEN PUT THE SMTP INFORMATION IN HERE TO BE ABLE TO USE A GMAIL EVEN ADDRESS OR SOME OTHER SERVER THE DEFAULT OPTION IS THE MAIL BUT YOU COULD ALSO DO SMELL DISABLE ABOUT EMAILS OR HAVE THEM WRITE TO DIRECTLY TO THE DATABASE YOU MAY WANT TO USE THESE LAST TWO OPTIONS IF YOU ARE USING THIS IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT OR YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE EMAILS YOU PROBABLY SEND IN PAPER LETTERS INSTEAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NATURE SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DO REDIRECT TO THE DATABASE BECAUSE THIS IS MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT AND THEN I WANT TO SAVE ON THAT ALL RIGHT PAYMENT PROCESSORS SO IF YOU WANT TO COLLECT PAYMENTS YOU CAN ENTER THAT INFORMATION IN HERE IT HAS A DUMMY PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOU PAID ATTENTION TO THE LAST VIDEO THAT I DID YOU'LL SEE WHERE I WENT IN AND SELECTED THE LOW DUMMY DATA AND SO IT AUTOMATICALLY PUTS A DUMMY PROCESSOR IN HERE HOWEVER I CAN ADD INFORMATION IN HERE FOR PAYPAL SO USING ANY PASSWORD AND SO FORTH AND MAKE THAT ACTUALLY WORK LIKE IT SHOULD AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE WEB PAYMENTS PRO STANDARD AND OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT ALRIGHT SO THAT COVERS PAYMENTS GO BACK TO THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST AND THEN NEXT YEAH THE TAGS OR CATEGORIES SO YOU CAN SPECIFY THOSE MANAGE GROUPS SO LIKE LIKE IT GIVES AN EXAMPLE STEERING COMMITTEE AND IF YOU HAVE CUSTOM FORMS OR SCREENS YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN PUT THOSE IN AND THEN LASTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVILLA CRM YOU CAN GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE AND CONFIGURE THOSE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT AND THERE'S PLENTY OF DOCUMENTATION ON THE SAVVY CRM WEBSITE ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THESE ITEMS AND SPECIFY THE OPTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO SET THEM UP SO THAT CONCLUDES THIS VIDEO ON WALKING THROUGH THE CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST FOR CIVI CRM IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONFIGURATION
