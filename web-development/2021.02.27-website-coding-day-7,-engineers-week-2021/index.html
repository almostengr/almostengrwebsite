<p>continuing with the next step in the
process
what i'm going to be working on is to
do the automated deployment now what i'm
going to actually do
is leverage the existing automated
deployment setup that i have for my
website
and pretty much copy it tweak it as navy
for
this website that i'm building let's get
into this
after this intro
all right what i have here is i've
already set up the host name
the private key and the username for
this particular repository
the credentials that you'll need are the
credentials that you would normally use
to ssh
into a server the private key is what
you will need to
create you use the command on linux
servers called ssh
keygen and it will ask you a series of
questions such as where you want to save
the file and if you want to put a
passcode
with that and what you will get is two
files you get a public key and a private
key
the public key is what will need to go
on the github side
and excuse me the private key is what
needs to go on github which
is this here the public key will need to
go into your
authorized keys file on the server
so i've already done the step because
these keys have
confidential information in them you
know if you're able to see the key then
you can log in
i did not do that step on camera
if you're interested in learning how to
do that uh
drop a comment down below to let me know
that you're interested
and i could probably do that in a future
video
that is not as critical so that you can
see the entire process
from beginning to end that being said so
i have
all of this information here so what i'm
going to do is i'm coming to
the repository of my personal website
and i'm just going to copy the yaml file
that is
in here and come over to the repository
uh for this particular project and
create a new
folder first i need to create a folder
and
the way github actions work is you have
to create a
github folder and then underneath that
folder you have to create another folder
called workflows and then underneath
that you will create a file that does
the actual actions and you can name this
file whatever you
want and so i'm going to do
uh let's see we'll go with uh
deploy to production that's the name of
the file
and the file needs to end with the yml
extension
so i'm going to go ahead and remove the
stuff that i know i don't need
i also need a port number i forgot about
that because the production web host
does have a particular port number that
is not the default port number that
has to be used so i'll have to go back
and add that key
to add this secret
to the repository and then
so add that secret here and then this
will work
but right now it almost works it's just
that part is missing
okay that being said um the branch
so we're going to stick with master on
this one right now we're
the at the time of the release of or the
recording of this video
uh ubuntu 20.04
is available but 18.04 is what i am
using
and i know works with my website
as far as this script goes so i'm not
going to change that
you know in the future i may change it
to uh when you know
1804 is not the i guess the main thing
that's being used also just remove the
spelling
because i'm not going to do spell check
on this content i want it to be able to
go through
if it has spelling errors uh they'll
just have to be fixed when they're fixed
all right and uh pretty much everything
else in here
is correct as is so you do a checkout of
the repository
you do a install of the various python 3
modules
then you do a fetch so you get all of
the
branches that are available in the
repository and then deploy
do a build of the repository
to the website branch and then after
that
you'll do a uh
you'll do a log into production and then
have production do a pull of the website
branch
and so before i do that though i'm going
to have to make some adjustments on the
server
because right now it is looking at the
main branch i believe
and there are some files that have been
updated so if i try to do
this right now is not going to work it's
going to complain that
there are some issues because i saw in
the logs on the server
that it was complaining about trying to
commit something
and it did not know what commit was and
it wasn't pretty error messages
all right so i have my file here set up
and i want this to
pretty much deploy on when
any branch well i only want this to
deploy when the master is touched
and so uh right now everything is not
ready to go
so i still would like it to potentially
even try to build
though at least just not necessarily
deploy so i may create another workflow
that only does build without the deploy
but i only wanted to deploy from master
and
that's it okay so let me go over here to
the commit or the version control screen
and so i do need to add this particular
file here
and let me pull up another window that
shows
the commits for
automating deployment to production
so that it looks like i created two of
the same thing all right so
items 22 and item 20
the workflow file
has been created okay
and we'll do enter on that and the rest
of that
is doesn't need to be touched so we go
ahead and push this up to
the repository
and it doesn't like that so i'm gonna
have to go to the terminal
and do this and that's
for some reason in visual studio code
sometimes i have
issues with pushing up to the repository
and so i have to go over to the terminal
and mainly push like the ubuntu terminal
not the visual studio code terminal
because of the credentials that it's
using
it will still try to use those same
credentials if i use the visual studio
code
terminal all right
next thing up is like i mentioned i need
to
fix that port number so i'm going to do
that off
camera i have now added the port number
and again i wanted to do that off camera
so that
you know i don't have the site being
hacked
and so i have all four of the secrets
that i need to use
and so just to talk a little bit about
the secrets files
if you want to have like secrets or
environment variables in here
uh basically you code a variable name
or if you will in your
github workflow and when your workflow
encounters this it knows to go
over to the secrets and pull that secret
out
and you can't see what once you put the
secret
in you can't see it like you need to
update it or remove it but you can't do
and edit so just keep that in mind that
like if you're doing like a private key
or something like that nature
make sure you have it already staged and
everything before you drop it in here
because once you drop it in here
it will not allow you to visualize it
any
further you know not be able to see it
again so just keep that in mind
the as far as the actions to build this
site
and ubuntu 18.04 it does not have the
necessary packages for python 3
and thus why i'm having to run each of
these python commands so
i want to do the upgrade of pip but
sometimes pip
the depending on the docker worker that
you get
pip may or may not be up to date so
update pip
and then for mk docs you need to also
have setup tools
you then obviously install mk docs and
install the manify plugin come to find
out i don't really need the rss plug-in
because i'm not using this for vlogs so
i can remove that out
and then i'll commit that on the next
go-round
the next part is that i want to do a
fetch
and i'm just going to uh put a name with
this as well
and stated that it is fetching all of
the
branches there we go
and then going to deploy to the website
branch
which is doing python 3 mk docs with
github deploy
after that you're going to do the deploy
step so if
any of these steps here fail then the
deploy step will not
run and the way that is set up is
all of these steps have to succeed
before this group of steps can run and
use the needs attribute for that and so
i say needs mk dots
and i group this set of steps as the
mk docs so that's how it knows hey if
this doesn't fail
don't run this one uh the same set of
commands are going to run you on ubuntu
18.04
and then i have a github action
by fifth sky i assume that's
or f if sky i don't know how you say
that username
um but he has a ssh action that will run
a set of commands that you specify so
what i have it doing is going
so once it logs in it will cd and then
change to the www directory and then do
a get pull
of the origin website branch
and that is it
and then it'll log out and so let me go
ahead
and go to the server now i need to go to
the web boot directory and
remember i mentioned that there's an
issue with the
get repository because it says something
i saw in some of the logs about the
commit message
and i'm not sure how long this is going
to take to run
i see it says refreshing the index all
right so i have some civic crm files
and there's some other files in here
that it is complaining about
that i'm not too really particular of so
what i'm going to do
is to copy
the
so i'm going to go ahead and stage the
existing files that is
talking about and then do commit
on those files
all right and there we go and these
additional files
i believe they could also be staged as
well
so i'm going to do get add sites
all modules cbcrm
there we go i don't want to commit the
settings file or that other
directory because they have some
database credentials and other things
that i don't want out there
on the open internet so i'm not going to
do that
added civi crm files
all right and we don't we have civic crm
installed but we don't use it
so i like i say it's still installed
here but
it's not used all right so if i do a git
pool like it's
mentioning because my origin and master
have diverged
like first i'm doing get fetch and
it should refresh a whole lot of stuff
which it did all right now i can do a
get cool
well gift status and so i am on the
master branch get cool
and i'm going to go ahead with that
merge exit
get push and it sends all that back
up
and i don't believe there's a lot of
files that it needs to push
but there may be a lot of files that it
needs to push uh
like i said i haven't updated this site
in a while because i knew that this
update was going to be coming and
drupal 7 which is what the site is
currently running on
is slated to be retired and so it's like
why bother updating it if i know it's
going to be retired really soon
all right so for the sake of
in case something goes wrong i'm going
to make a backup
directory and then i'm going to
move the well go ahead and make a copy
of sites and connect
as well as sites default cbcrm
over to that backup directory
all right and so if i do a ls of the
backup directory
[Music]
uh no ls of backup
there we go so i have it should be two
in there
i think i need to la yes there we go so
we have
a backup of those files that i did not
commit
now if i do a
i believe it will work now so if i go
ahead and
do a pull request for this repository
uh in the worst case scenario i'm gonna
have to come back
and save some of the
files but i think i have all of that
covered so
i'm gonna do uh
not sure why it's not letting me go
ahead and do that because i
base that branch off of the master
so the entire version history is there
if i did do some enhancements
and some bug fixes so we'll just go
ahead and mark those two
create the pull request and let's see
what it does not like about this pull
request
so there are some conflicting files
i need to
[Music]
all right resolve the conflicts why are
there conflicting files
because what i recall i deleted those
files or maybe because it
when i did it i probably just because i
committed those files just now that
might be the problem with that
all right so let's follow the command
line instructions
and i'm going to come back to my
local and do a get fetch
as it's suggesting and so it really said
get
fetch origin but i'm already set up on
the origin so there's nothing else to
fetch
and then get check out
some already so do well i already have
good status um
all right so let me go ahead and whoops
all right so let me go ahead and do get
at
this existing file uh i think that was
item
20 believe it was item
20 yes items 20 and 22
and 20 pound 20 added
updated workflow config
gotta type it correctly work flow config
all right and then do a push of that
all right so that has been pushed up and
it's checking
obviously that issue still exists and so
now
we'll do uh
get status to see which branch i'm on
and i really i don't know if it's going
to make me move these files but i don't
need
to necessarily commit those files so
since i already have the
mk dot branch checked out i can do a get
so let's do get merge master
um okay
i already have it why didn't it not
okay so get fetch
all right get uh let's do get check out
get check out master and be more
specific
get cool origin master
all right get check out mk docs which is
the
where i put the thing is now if i do get
merge
master all right now i have my conflicts
and so i can do get status and see
the two conflicts so deleted by us so i
still want to
remove those files so get rm includes
common and
includes uh
includes form dot inc all right get
status
and so those files have been
new changes to be committed so i also
want to go ahead and remove these
out and so if i do
[Music]
a
um
so to get rm sites
all
i guess those files can go ahead and be
staged and then i'll probably have to
come back
and uh remove those again
forget status get commit without a
message
and it's going to automatically create a
message and then you can look into the
history of
what it's going to do so it's going to
add these files that i just recently
submitted but i can come back and remove
those later so that's fine with me
all right so master has been merged into
mk dots get status
not sure why maybe do it that way
um
all right so now it says for step two
check out master
get merge dash dash no ff
mk docs
all right that is done get push origin
master and provide my credentials
all right so that has been updated
should see it refresh
and now that has been addressed and i
can delete
the mk docs branch i'm not going to do
that just yet
so let me go over here and check my
github actions and i do have my
deployment action running
and so if we come over here i probably
don't want to show this
while it's running so wait till it gets
done so come over here to the
master branch
and all right so i do have my mk docs
branch
i do have another branch in here that i
attempted to redesign the website and
uh i never used so while we're waiting
on that action to complete
i can go ahead and remove this unused
branch so
bye bye to that all right still waiting
on a github action to complete as you
see that's indicated by this yellow
arrow here
and if i come back over to actions
um i'm not sure what all is going to
output onto the screen that's why i
don't want to show that right now
uh but i can't show you that everything
in here so i added a readme file to this
particular project
and also since i'm from switching
technologies i guess i can go ahead and
update
the tags that are over here so we are no
longer
let's see so this site is no longer
using drupal
so i'm going to go ahead and remove
drupal here it is
non-profit we'll do a static um
what was that tag let's see stem
non-profit
a non-profit website from google seven
okay so static and
static sites also static sites
static site generator
and then um static maybe website
yep static website
generation um
got nsbe that is a tag
or uh engineering
engineering organization
we'll put that there okay and so the
reason i am doing it
this way uh of adding these topics here
is because that helps you know with this
repository being able to be found
and we don't have any packages we don't
have releases and
i'm gonna uncheck the environments too
because it's designed in a way that
the environments will work uh
without any issues so the deployment
failed
and i'm sure it has something to do with
the ssh keys no
okay so there's a refusal to emerge
unrelated histories cool all right so if
i come back to
the production and go to the
web root directory to get status and i
might have to mainly do a
get check out uh no i'm sorry
do get fetch uh
there we go
all right and it should update this
master branch and maybe i need to go and
update the commands that is executing on
the server as well
all right so now if i do a get pool
and then it should update everything now
there we go all right so now if i go to
the website
i should see the new website
up and running which i don't or
oh three that is never a good thing that
you want to get is a 403
and just to make sure all right so
it checked out the master branch which
you should not have so get check out
website and then from origin slash
website get fetch let me see hold on
this is not auto completing so that's
slightly concerning
get branch dash a not double a single a
all right so get checkout i guess
this won't do it website origin slash
website
[Music]
that should work here shortly might take
a second
what i missed was the dash b command
because this branch has never existed
in this particular server it when it
tried to do that
automated deployment it failed because
you can't check out a new branch and so
forth and so
uh yeah that made sense why it didn't
work
all right so now i do see my files and
so if i do a refresh
i should get a page yes so this site is
now working
in production um from the last set
of videos there
you probably noticed there is some
changes here i did a lot of
minor tweaking such as getting this
carousel to not stretch the image
and a number of other things on here off
camera
because it took it took me a while to
get all that done
but if you want to see all of those
minor changes or how they're implemented
you can easily go check the repository
that contains this information and
you know all of that there so now what
i'm going to do is to actually go
through
and check to make sure that everything
looks correct
and so far so good there may be some
minor changes that i may need to make
at a later point as i can you know
continue to do a deep dive
but for the most part it looks like all
of the links are working like they
should be working
and so there are no concerns with that
so if you come back to
the github repository i mean excuse me
you come back to
my local setup and i do a pool
uh excuse me do a fetch not a pool
all right so the 960 branch got deleted
and we now have a new branch called
website
so at no point should you ever have to
update this website branch this branch
is specifically for the deployment
and the static html css and javascript
files
what i do want to check though i think i
need to check a couple of other things
such as the
make sure that i am using minified css
and javascript files
i believe i did put the minifi for well
nope so it looks like i missed one here
so let's reference that and then while
i'm at it go ahead
and open that file and do the
minification on it
as well as go ahead and trim this one
do the arrow trim there we go to make
sure
and i'm also going to come back and
format this uh
format document there we go and trim
volumetic two all right so all of that
looks good all of that looks good
and so if i come back over to the
terminal
and do a get status i do have
my base html and
css files that have been updated in
particular the minified file
and let me see just one more thing
before i do a commit and push this up
because this commit
when i push it up will actually deploy
up to
the production automatically it should
not have any issues so this will be
another test
of that before everything uh before i
call this a
close to the project um
all right so yeah we have all the css
files minified
if we go down here there's a script so
that's also minified
so should be good to go so if you do get
status
status all right hit commit and we'll do
i'll go ahead and close out the issue
that i have open here so let me go back
to
the repository and so
i still have open 24
and 22 and 20 23 is
i'm still waiting on some more
information for that one so i won't be
doing that right now
but that's simple when you for payment
buttons you can uh depend on the
platform that you're using
you can get those if you're using
platform like we use
uh you can just go into clap paypal
and request those buttons to be created
enter the necessary details for those
and it gives you the html code and all
you gotta do is copy and paste
html code into the website
all right so updates completed
all right get status and do get push and
then i'm gonna remove these
images that i did not commit to the
repository out of here
and that way these errors this red
uh set of files so these untrack files
will
be removed all right so that branch has
been updated so if we
uh come back to the code you should see
the automated deployment running which
it is
and so it is preparing that push
and um there are some other minor tweaks
that i'm probably going to have to do
such as the hd access files uh get those
staged in the appropriate places because
one thing that i've noticed with
mk docs is the mk the hidden files
usually it will not deploy those to it
will not
consider those when you do your
deployment and so what you have to do is
you have to stage that file
make the necessary updates stage it
manually um since it won't automatically
stage it for you
and then just have an exclusion rule and
uh on the server i believe where it
ignores that
if it you know encounters it or anything
of that nature
one other thing i'm going to also have
to do i did not test this locally
because i do not have
php set up on this particular computer
but i want to set up the uh confirm that
the email
setup is working correctly and that the
php script that i have
is working i need to implement those
variables here so i will do that off
camera
pretty much i have the help desk email
so where is it going to email this form
to
and i think that's pretty much it
because everything else in this form
because i've copied it from what i
currently use
is pretty much straightforward so keep
in mind
like i've mentioned this before but i'll
mention it again when you
write code especially code that you're
writing on projects that you
are doing for whatever personal purposes
then keep in mind you know be able to
reuse that code
if you're building code at work you know
you're not
necessarily going to be able to do those
things but you can kind of reference
what you've already done
and use that to your advantage so it's
kind of a similar system
scenario but you is you probably won't
be able to copy your code that you're
doing at
your job to your personal projects but
you can kind of
structure it in a similar manner for
that
you know site to be able to achieve that
same goal
all right so the automated deployment
did complete successfully as you see
there is a green check mark here
as denoted by the uh for the action that
it did perform so all of those are good
and so
um there's no i don't think i made a
significant change on here
that you would actually be able to see
it one thing i have considered doing
is to make sure that my deployments are
making
making it to production without actually
having to log into production and check
the date and time stamps
is to be able to check have a bill date
somewhere in
the either in the bottom of the footer
or somewhere in the source code of the
webpage
and that way i can look at that as well
as a kind of a
confirmation because github will report
success but sometimes
that success may not actually be
successful depending on if you type the
wrong commands in or something of that
nature
so having that bill date in here would
help with that
confirmation but i'm not too concerned
with that like if i see something that's
just like really really far off
then i know something's probably going
array or
not quite right all right that
will believe we'll cover this part of
the
video series where we i set up the
automated deployment
again it's very straightforward if you
want to you can
copy this particular workflow file i
have a link to
all of this information for this entire
week series of videos
down in the description that way you can
reference everything that you need
from the description so again links in
the description
if you've learned something please give
this video a thumbs up
and if you have not already please be
sure to subscribe each week
new videos this week is a special week
because of the fact it's engineering
week
but new week new videos every week
especially on tuesdays </p>
