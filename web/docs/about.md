## IT (Information Technology) Professional

Kenny's day job is working as an IT professional. He has years of experience in building web based 
applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living, 
often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for
that code snippet and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding
projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for.

## Gardening

Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After having some seasons of little success and being able to 
literately taste the fruits of my labor, Kenny decided to expand his green thumb skill set. Thanks to
social media, Kenny found other that some friends and former classmates also had an interest in 
gardening and they were looking for help. After attending a class at a local urban farm about 
gardening, it occurred to him that a blog could be used as a journal to track my successes and failures.

Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located in the 
southeastern United States. That being said, the recommendations and suggestions that are made on 
this blog are for this growing zone and are not guaranteed to work in other growing zones. However,
please do feel free to experiment in your garden and share your experiences.

## Why Does Kenny Blog?

Kenny has been blogging his gardening, technology experiences, and mishaps for several reasons:

* you learn from your past mistakes
* others can learn from your mistakes before they make them
* you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going.

## "The Almost Engineer" Explanation

If you have read this far down the page, you probably are wondering how did Kenny come up with 
The Almost Engineer name. Kenny works (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field
of Computer Science, has great problem solving skills, and enjoys fixing things instead of paying 
someone else to do it for him. However Kenny has a Business degree from the University of Alabama 
(Roll Tide!) instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer.

## Blog Technology

Originally, Kenny started blogging on Blogger in 2010.

After several years of a having the blog there, the blog was converted to
Drupal 7. At the time of this switch, Kenny was using Drupal 7 on a number
of websites that Kenny was building and maintaining. So it made sense to use
it for his personal use.

In 2019, Kenny converted the blog again from Drupal 7 over to MKDocs. The reason
for this conversion was because he found myself spending more time performing
maintenance updates than writing content. He outlines this more in his post on
[switching from Drupal to MkDocs](/technology/2019.12.21-switched-blog-from-drupal-to-mkdocs).
