# Change Air Filter on 2013-2018 (5th Generation) Nissan Altima

## Summary

This tutorial shows you how to change the engine air filter of a 2013 Nissan Altima. Although 
this is being done on a 2013 Altima, the procedure is the same for all 5th generation 
(2013-2018) Altimas. This procedure has not been tested on Altima Coupe, which has a slightly 
different air filter design. Total time to do this is less than 5 minutes. It actually took 
longer to get the replacement filter than to actually replace the filter. Some are scared to 
do work on their car. However, this shows you how simple it can be to replace the air 
filter. As you see, no tools are required.
