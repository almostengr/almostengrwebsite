## Background

What is a coding chalelnge? A coding challenge strives to test ones ability to be able to solve a
problem using a defined set of criteria. Often times, coding challenges that you will find online are
used as interview questions, such as

## Why Do Challenges

I periodically do coding challenges. The reason that I do challenges is to test my knowledge of the
programming language and expose myself to different aspects of the language.

For instance, I primarily build web applications using .NET Core MVC.
Most of the coding challenges that I do, consists of working with console applications. While both
of these use the same programming language, they are very different in their architecture. In my blog
post about [getting a tech job without experience](/technology/2021.05.06-tech-job-with-no-experience),
I mentioned that you will get better and more opportunities if you are specialist instead of being a
jack of all trades. Thus why I do all of the challenges presented in C# instead of Python or
other languages that others insist that they should be done in.

## Challenge Ideas

### Online Sources

For those of you that struggle to come up with ideas to do for a coding challenge, then look online.
You can take a homework assignment that someone had for their class and turn that into a coding
challenge. If someone is doing a challenge in Python and you are learning Java, then do that
same challenge in Java. You can also check out the coding challenges that I have completed.

### Refactor Code To Another Language

One way that you can better your skills in a certain programming language, is to refactor code in another 
programming language into the language of your choosing. By doing this, the following will happen: 

* expand your knowledge on the language that you are working in
* learn another programming language 
* the differences between programming languages

All of the above will make you a better programmer and expand your knowledge at the same time.

### Submit A Challenge

I take challenge ideas. If you have an idea for a challenge, you can
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr/coding-challenge/issues" target="_blank">file an issue</a>
on my coding challenge repository and I will look into completing it. If the challenge is
interesting enough, I may even post me working on the challenge on my
