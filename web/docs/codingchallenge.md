## Background

What is a coding chalelnge? A coding challenge strives to test ones ability to be able to solve a 
problem using a defined set of criteria. Often times, coding challenges that you will find online are 
used as interview questions, such as

## Why Do Challenges

I periodically do coding challenges. The reason that I do challenges is to test my knowledge of the 
programming language and expose myself to different aspects of the language. 

For instance, I primarily build web applications using .NET Core MVC. 
Most of the coding challenges that I do, consists of working with console applications. While both 
of these use the same programming language, they are very different in their architecture. In my blog 
post about [getting a tech job without experience](/technology/2021.05.06-tech-job-with-no-experience),
I mentioned that you will get better and more opportunities if you are specialist instead of being a 
jack of all trades. Thus why I do all of the challenges presented in C# instead of Python or 
other languages that others insist that they should be done in. 

## Challenge Ideas 

I take challenge ideas. If you have an idea for a challenge, you can

on my coding challenge repository and I will look into completing it. If the challenge is 
interesting enough, I may even post me working on the challenge on my
