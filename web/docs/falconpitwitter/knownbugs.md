## Exception on First Run

An exception may occur and written in the log if the Wifi connection has not been established before the first run. 
Confirm in the log that HttpRequestException is not repeating in the logs after 2 or 3 attempts. If the 
message continues to appear, double check your Wifi or ethernet connection.
