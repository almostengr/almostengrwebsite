# Greens From the Winter Garden

As we enter March, it's almost time to prepare for the summer garden.

## Weather Summary

However, Mother Nature decided to throw a curve ball with an unexpected frost after severe weather. I
did see a post on social media about the groundhog got the weather forecast wrong. This is not surprising.
What sense does it make to take weather advice from a cousin of a rodent? I'm just saying. Back to the
subject at hand... the winter garden is still producing ready to eat food. This is a picture of a mustard
green that I pulled from the garden. As you can see it is as long as my arm, which is over two feet in
length. There were multiple leaves on the stalk like this one.

## Garden Harvest

In total, I picked about 2 pounds of greens
and still didn't make a dent in the on hand supply. I think part of the reason for the greens being able to
grow so large is due to the large amounts of rain that have taken place in recent weeks. Also being able to
control the snails, catepillar worms, and other pests that feed on them with a mixture of salt and flour
has helped. Without this occasional pest control, they would devour the leaves resulting in holes or entire
leaves missing. This week's weather has multiple frosty nights in the forecast. This is contrary to the
severe weather and tornadoes that were experienced during the previous weekend. The frost will continue to
control any pests that did start to set up shop on the leaves, especially the snails.
