## Types of Plant Reproduction

* sexual (seeds) 
* asexual (vegetative)

## Sexual Reproduction 

* parts of the plants are from the previous module. 
* seeds generate differently between monocot and dicot 
* epicotyl is usually the first thing that shows up out of the ground 
* seeds go dormant so that they don't sprout too close to the parent 

### Dormacy

* breaking the seed coat so that the dormancy can be broken
* stratification - related to a chemical dormacy
* seeds can be started in the seed. 
* if you use your fridge for stratifiction, be sure to label it 

### Germination 

* requires moisture, temperature, oxygen, light 
* look at that charts for the seed temperature for the plant 
* heat pads may be needed for germination for those that have higher germination temperatures

### Why to start your own plant 

* extend the growing season 
* wider selection of varieties 
* more control over environment 
* save money 
* increases survival rate (already has a head start with your environment)
* reduces weed competition 
* helps you grow the exact number of plants 

### Seed Planting 

* select your varieties, start at least 6 weeks before the growing season 
* get seed trays
* get seed starting mix (usually no soil, things that hold mixture and fertilizer)
* have seed starting area ready 
* sterilize the container before you use it 
* make sure that it has drainage, maybe holes in the bottom 

### Containers 

* flats
* old cans
* milk jugs
* egg cartons
* baby food jars 

### Saving Seeds

* save money 
* preserve diversity 
* retain pest resistance 
* connect with what you grow 
* create new varieties adapted to your growing conditions 

### hybrid vs open pollinated 

* open pollinated will produce a seed that is almost or identical to the parent 
* hybrids are intentionally crosspollinated. they have specific characteristics that the 
grower wants. they come from the same two different parents 

### Saving Seeds 

* the fruit and seed mature simultaneously 
* remove the seed from fruit 
* clean the seed 
* dry the seed 
* package the seed and label completely
* LABEL THE SEED
* get seed packets... can use envelope from office supply store 

## Storing Seeds

* dry, low humidity, less than 10% humidity
* cool, 32-45 degrees 
* can use the silica packets 
* seeds last from 1 to 7 years, depends on the plant
