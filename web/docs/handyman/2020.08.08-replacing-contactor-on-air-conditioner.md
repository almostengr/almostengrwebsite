The air conditioner stopped working at my home. Come to find out, one of the wires had burned off 
on the contactor, which resulted in a hot house in August. Definitely not something good. Take a look 
at the video to see how I diagnosed and fixed the issue.

## Video Transcript

ONE DAY I CAME HOME AND I NOTICED THAT
THE TEMPERATURE WAS A LITTLE BIT WARMER
THAN IT USUALLY IS AND SO I WENT INTO
THE SENSE APP AND CHECKED TO SEE WHEN
THE LAST TIME THE AIR-CONDITIONER
SPECIFICALLY THE LAST TIME THE
COMPRESSOR RAN AND I NOTICED AND RAN
SINCE ONE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING I HAD TO
GO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IN
THE HEAT OF AUGUST YOU NEED AIR
CONDITIONING ALRIGHT SO THERE'S A
CONTACTOR AND THERE'S A CAPACITOR SO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS
SO FAN IS RUNNING BUT THERE'S NO I DON'T
HEAR THE COMPRESSOR RUNNING TOO
ALL RIGHT SO I DID FIND A PROBLEM ONE OF
THE WIRES CRAP WHERE'S IT THEY GO ONE
RIGHT RIGHT HERE BURNED ON THE CONTACT
AS YOU SEE SO LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO GET
ANOTHER CONTACT MAYBE AND REESE TRIPPED
THAT WIRE AND REPLACE IT AND LOOKS LIKE
THAT WIRE BEHIND IT ALSO STARTED TO BURN
AS WELL I GOT THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR
MY HVAC BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE TO HAVE A HVAC LICENSE IN ORDER TO
BUY THIS PART LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET
IT WITHOUT THAT BUT YEAH AND SAME RIGHT
SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO CHECK TO MAKE
SURE THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY
FLOWING TO THE CONDENSER THE LAST THING
YOU WANT TO DO IS TO OPEN THIS AND THEN
GET ELECTROCUTED SO THEN YOU PROCEED TO
OPEN THE CONDENSER THE THIS PARTICULAR
MODEL HAS FOUR SCREWS THAT COVER THE
HOUSING YOUR MODEL MAY BE SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT SO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT
NEXT YOU'RE GONNA DISCONNECT ALL OF THE
WIRES THAT RUN TO THE CONTACTOR BECAUSE
AFTER YOU GET ALL OF THE WIRES
DISCONNECTED THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE
THE CONTACTOR FOR MY PARTICULAR
SITUATION THE CONTACTOR HAD SCREWS ON
THE CONNECTING POINT SOME OF THEM DID
HAVE THESE WHAT I CALL QUICK CONNECTORS
BUT OTHER ONES HAD SCREWS ON THEM SO FOR
THOSE OF HOW THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO
THE CONTACTOR YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT
ALL OF THE WIRES FROM THE CONTACTOR IN
ORDER TO REMOVE IT ALRIGHT FOLKS SO I
GOT MY NEW CONTACTOR WHICH IS THIS ONE
OVER HERE AND MY OLD CONTACTOR WHICH IS
THIS ONE HERE FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE SCREW ON THIS
ONE ACTUALLY I HAD TO SCREW IT ALL THE
WAY OUT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THERE SO
BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES THAT I'M NOTICED
SO ON THE TOP OF THIS ONE ACTUALLY YOU
STICK THE WIRE IN WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD A
CLAMP THAT YOU PUT A CONNECTOR ON IT AND
THEN YOU PUT THAT CONNECTOR AROUND THE
SCREW HEAD SO THE TOP IS ESSENTIALLY
LIKE THE BOTTOM NOW WHERE YOU STICK THE
WHOLE WIRE IN AND THEN YOU SCREW THE TO
CLAMP IT DOWN ALL THE WAY ALSO THE SAME
NUMBER OF PINS HERE LOOKS TO BE THERE'S
EIGHT ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S EIGHT ON
THE TOP HERE I ONLY HAD I BELIEVE THOSE
TWO WIRES HERE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE
THE CONTACTOR ITSELF I WON'T BE USING
ALL OF THOSE PINS SINCE I DON'T HAVE ALL
OF THOSE WIRES AND THIS ONE ALSO IS
ENCLOSED SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE
THE COIL ON THIS ONE FROM BOTH SIDES SO
BUT YOU CAN ON THIS ONE AND THE REASON
BEING IS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TOOK ACCOUNT
THAT HEY BUGS CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THIS
THING AND CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WHAT THEY DO
NOW IS THEY ACTUALLY SEAL IT UP ENTIRELY
SO ALL THIS MECHANICAL STUFF LIKE THIS
RIGHT HERE IT'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE
ELEMENTS HOWEVER YOU CAN TAKE THESE TWO
SCREWS OFF AND THIS PLAY TO COME UP AND
THEN IT WILL LOOK JUST LIKE THIS INSIDE
UNDERNEATH THIS COVER HERE SO THAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW CONTACTOR AND
THE OLD CONTACTOR AND ONE OTHER
DIFFERENCE THEY DID NOT HAVE IF YOU CAN
KIND OF TELL THIS ONE IS RATED AT 25
AMPS AND THIS ONE IS RATED AT 30 SO THEY
DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME RATING BUT IT IS
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PART JUST THE
WRITING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO AS YOU
SEE IS STILL OPERATING WITH A 24 VOLT
COIL LIKE THIS ONE IS HERE AND SO IT'S
ALSO A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT REALLY MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
AND BE SURE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE
SCREWS BECAUSE THIS THING DOES HAVE TO
GO BACK IN AND TRYING TO FIND THE SCREWS
THAT MATCH OR WILL FIT ME HOLES THAT
IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR PANEL OR
CONDENSER IS PRETTY DIFFICULT I'M
YOU COULD USE ONE OF THE OTHER SCREWS
AND PUT IT THERE BUT AGAIN THE HASSLE OF
GOING THROUGH THE STORE AND TRYING TO
FIND ANOTHER SCREW TO REPLACE THAT ONE
CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO ONCE YOU GET THE
OLD ONE OUT YOU CAN PUT THE NEW ONE IN
AND PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN
IS THE REVERSE STEPS OF TAKING THE OLD
ONE OUT AND MY PARTICULAR SCENARIO I HAD
WIRES THAT BURNED I'M NOT SURE IF THERE
WAS JUST AN ARC OR JUST CORROSION OR
MAYBE EVEN A CRITTER OR SOMETHING GOT
INTO THE EAR AND SHORTER THINGS OUT BUT
NONETHELESS THE WIRES WERE BURNED AS I
SHOWED YOU EARLIER IN THE VIDEO SO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT MORE WIRE CUT
OFF THE BURNT SECTION IDEALLY THERE'S A
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WIRE LEFT IN HERE
IF NOT YOU MAY HAVE TO WHAT THEY CALL
KIND OF LIKE PIGTAIL SO YOU PUT IN A NEW
WIRE OF A LONGER LINK AND JOIN THE TWO
WIRES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO YOU KNOW RESIZE IT BACK TO THE
APPROPRIATE LENGTH BUT IN MY CASE I HAVE
PLENTY OF WIRE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND
SO THAT ADDING ADDITIONAL WIRE WAS NOT
NECESSARY I WAS JUST ABLE TO CUT OFF
WHAT I HAD AND WIRE IT IN THE CONTACTOR
THAT I'M USING DOES NOT HAVE THE QUICK
CONNECTORS ON IT OR REQUIRED THAT THEY
BE USED AND SO WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WAS
TO STICK THE CONNECTOR I'M EXCUSE ME TO
STICK THE WIRE INTO THE HOLE AND THEN
TIGHTEN THE SCREW DOWN AND THAT HELD THE
WIRE IN PLACE TO THE CONNECTOR SO YOU
DON'T HAVE THAT QUICK CONNECTOR ON THERE
ANYMORE ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
CONNECTED YOU'LL NEED TO REARRANGE THE
WIRES AND SECURE THEM BACK INSIDE OF THE
ENCLOSURE OR THE PANEL IDEALLY YOU DON'T
WANT TO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE
OF THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER IF
YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES ORIGINALLY
BEFORE I PULL THIS PANEL UP ALL THE
WIRES WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER IN A LARGE
BUNDLE WITH A ZIP TIE SO TRY TO PUT IT
BACK THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE YOU START MESSING WITH IT THAT
WAY YOU CAN ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE AND AS YOU CAN
SEE HERE I HAVE THE ENTIRE WIRE SET
WRAPPED IN BUNDLES I MEAN EXCUSE ME
WRAPPED IN ZIP WITH A SINGLE ZIP TIE
LIKE IT WAS BEFORE AND I'M MAKING SURE
THAT EVERYTHING FITS THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE I STARTED MESSING WITH THINGS AND
THAT NONE OF THE WIRES ARE CROSSED OVER
OR ALL THOSE TYPE OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T SHORT OUT THE SYSTEM OR CAUSE
YOURSELF FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT YOU OR A
TECHNICIAN MAY HAVE TO FIX ONCE YOU HAVE
ALL THE WIRES IN PLACE AND EVERYTHING
YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO THEN
GO FLIP ON THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING WORKS AS IT SHOULD ALL RIGHT
SO I HAVE CONDITIONING AGAIN YOU WANT TO
DO THIS BEFORE YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON
BECAUSE IF YOU TEST IT AFTER YOU PUT THE
COVER BACK ON AND SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE COVER BACK OFF
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT NOW I
KNOW ON SOME SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ACCESS
THE CONTACTOR AND THE CAPACITOR YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE FAN OFF AND
SOME OTHER COMPONENTS SO IN THAT CASE IF
YOUR SYSTEM IS SET UP THAT WAY YOU'LL
NEED TO PUT THOSE ITEMS BACK ON BEFORE
TESTING BECAUSE IF THE FAN IS NOT
SECURED AND YOU SWITCH IT ON
THE FAM MAY DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE
UNIT AND ALSO BE A HAZARD TO ANYBODY
THAT WOULD BE STANDING NEARBY IF IT WERE
TO COME APART FROM THE SYSTEM ONCE YOU
HAVE CONFIRMED THAT EVERYTHING IS
WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE THEN YOU CAN PUT
THE PANEL AND SCREWS BACK IN PLACE AND
THAT WILL BE IT ALSO WHILE YOU'RE AT IT
YOU CAN CHECK THE OTHER PARTS OF THE
CONDITION COAL SUCH AS THE LINES THAT
RUN IN AND OUT AS WELL AS THE WIRING
THAT GOES IN AND OUT TO THAT UNIT THIS
WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO DO THAT SINCE
YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO DO REPAIRS ON
THAT TO LOOK IT OVER AS WELL AND I'VE
BEEN MENTIONING IT EARLIER IN THE VIDEO
BUT IF YOU HAVE BUGS OR ANYTHING INSIDE
THE PLACE WHERE THE CONTACTOR AND
CAPACITOR ARE TRY TO CLEAN THOSE OUT THE
REASON BEING IS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES
THOSE ARE THE CULPRITS FOR YOUR
CAPACITOR OR CONTACTOR TO STOP WORKING
THEY SOMETIMES WILL CRAWL IN THERE AND
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CAPACITOR THEY
ACTUALLY CRAWL INSIDE OF THE CAPACITOR
AND WHEN THE CAPACITOR GOES TO SWITCH ON
IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SWITCH ON BECAUSE
THAT BUG MIGHT BE BLOCKING THE
MECHANICAL PORTIONS OF THAT FROM MOVING
AND SIMILAR FOR THE CAPACITOR IF THERE'S
A BUG OR SOME KIND OF ANIMAL IN THERE
AND IT'S TOUCHING THE YOU KNOW TWO MORE
POINTS OF THE CAPACITOR AND THAT
CAPACITOR SWITCHES ON IT CAN ACTUALLY
CAUSE THAT CAPACITOR TO SHORT OUT
BECAUSE THAT OTHER ANIMAL IS ACTUALLY
GIVEN A PATH BETWEEN TWO OF THE TOOL
BOARD THE TERMINALS ON THE CAPACITOR SO
AGAIN CLEANING OUT THE BUGS COBWEBS
ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT NATURE
ALSO TAKE NOTE IF THERE ARE ANY CHEWED
WIRES BECAUSE IF THERE SHOOT WIRES THEN
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A RAT OR RODENT
PROBLEM AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
AS WELL HOPEFULLY YOU'VE LEARNED A
LITTLE BIT AND ARE ABLE TO APPLY THIS IN
THE FUTURE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
