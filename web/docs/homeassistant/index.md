Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology.

Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home.
I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community.

The documentation for <a href="https://home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> can be
somewhat daunting for the beginnger. By providing my
configuration, hopefully it will assist you and others with their configuraiton of their own instance.

The configuration for my Home Assistant instance is available at
