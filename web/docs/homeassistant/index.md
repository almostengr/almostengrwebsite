The documentation for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) can be somewhat daunting 
for the beginnger. By providing my
configuration, hopefully it will assist you and others with their configuraiton of their own instance.

## Tutorials

I have created tutorials for setting up various items and automations in Home Assistant. 
Those tutorials are available to watch on my 
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HCouBLtXD1j1U_17aBqig) in the 
[Home Assistant Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAJ0fv0d9WMOGZmLnghrG321kVueGfuL). 
There are also
tutorials available on the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) website.
