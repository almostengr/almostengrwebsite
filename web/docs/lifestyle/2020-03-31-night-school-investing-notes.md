## Background

After the quarantine started, SchoolHouseU started doing IG Live sessions called Night School. The
purpose of these night school classes was to teach people various skills by people that have demonstrated
their skills online.

This particular session was about investing and finances. I have provided my notes from the session below
so that others may learn what was shared in the session.

This particular course was done by a guy know as the Wall Street Trapper.
