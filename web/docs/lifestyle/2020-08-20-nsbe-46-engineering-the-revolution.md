## Background

This convention was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus. The convention took place from August 19-23, 2020.
Given that the convention was hosted online, there were some opportunities to network with others, but
not as many that You would normally have at an in-person convention.

I have decided to publish my notes online so that I have them for future reference and for others
to see what types of workshops were held.
