There are two main ways that I cook chicken. [Low and slow](#low-and-slow-steps) or
[hot and fast](#hot-and-fast-steps). Thus I have broken up the steps
in this post to describe both depending on how much time that you have.

Regardless the method that you choose, the ingredients are the same for both recipes.

### Required Kitchen Tools

* an oven
* dutch oven or cast iron pot (I use a cast iron pot)
* spatula
* baking sheet (for Low and Slow)

### Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken
* seasonings of your choosing
*(in the photo above, I used McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning)*
* lemon, cut in to quarters or eighths (optional)
* onions, cut in quarters or eighths (optional)

## Low and Slow Steps

* Preheat oven to 250 F (121 C)
* Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs
* Dry the skin with paper towel
* Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin)
with the spices of your choosing;
if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken
* Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on

*NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator*
*or go directly into the oven*

* Place in the oven and let cook for about 4 hours. Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size
of your chicken. Bird is done when your thermometer reads at least 160 F (71 C) at the thigh and breast
* Remove the pot from the oven
* Turn your oven on to Broil.
* Remove the chicken from the pot and place onto a baking sheet.

*NOTE: There will be a lot of liquid in the pot. The last step of this section addresses this.*

*NOTE: It is easier to remove the chicken from the pot if you cut it in half first. I usually use a*
*spatula to cut the chicken in half (yes it is that tender that you do not need a knife).*
*Then use the spatula to remove the chicken halves in a single piece from the pot to the baking sheet.*

* Place the chicken back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the chicken once the skin has
reached your preferred level of crispiness.
* With the liquid that remains in the pot, you can use it to make chicken broth or chicken gravy.

* Then the chicken is ready to serve.

## Hot And Fast Steps

* Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C)
* Wash the chicken, removing the pouch of organs
* Dry the skin with paper towel
* Season the inside (cavity) and underneath the skin of the chicken (between the meat and skin)
with the spices of your choosing;
if are adding lemons, onions, or other seasonings, go ahead and place those inside the chicken
* Place the chicken in the dutch oven or cast iron pot with the breast side down and the pot lid on

*NOTE: At this point, you can either allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator*
*or go directly into the oven*

* Place in the oven and let cook for about 30 minutes. (This is to crispy up the skin)
* Turn the oven down to 400 F (204 C) and allow to continue cooking for about 2 hours.

*Exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of
your chicken. Bird is done when your thermometer reads at least 160 F (71 C) at the thigh and breast*

* Remove the pot from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes

*NOTE: It is easier to remove the chicken from the pot if you cut it in half first. I usually use a*
*spatula to cut the chicken in half. Then use the spatula to remove the chicken halves in a single*
*piece from the pot.*

* Then the chicken is ready to serve.
