* read the plan that was shared by the Genius Group

### NSBE Scientific Journal

can print it themselves

promote the event in a social media blurb
* leveraging open source software instead of using the paid software; CiviCRM and GIMP mentioned
* need to set up donation circles, and publically recognize the individuals that do donate. That will
encourage those that have not already donated to do so.
* how we can better have the Finanace Zone integrate with the Communication Zone
* Fonteva, name of the CRM system that NSBE will be moving towards.

### Promoting The NSBE Brand

* brands are identified by their logo; logo must stand out
* 4 official logos can be used, can be downloaded from the national website
* don't modify the logo outside the guidelines
* professionals as a series of logos as well,
* have to submit design, in pdf, to the National Publications chairperson; there is a logo approval form;
* need to have a consistency in sharing our message
* Sometimes the conversation online, needs to move to email or DM to be fully addressed. Sometimes the
conversation can be blown out of proportion if not done in that manner.
* Sometimes members dont want to receive certain emails; thus will miss some of those critical communications
* Page of links to all the forms that exist; therefore members dont have to send emails and those emails
end up getting overlooked.
* need to determine what the brand will become
* collegiate member not interested in becoming a Professional member; need to communicate the benefits
of being a Professional member; have the collegiate members let them know where they can get help
from the Professionals members; let it be known where the seniors are headed
