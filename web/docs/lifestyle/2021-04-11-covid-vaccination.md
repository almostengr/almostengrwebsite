Since the COVID-19 vaccine was being rolled out, I eventually was able to sign up to get the Moderna vaccine. 
I did not want to be the very first to get it because of the medical disparities that exist when it comes 
to treating Black and minorities. At the same time, wanted to be able to have an additional line of 
defense in case I was exposed to COVID.

## First Shot

### Day Zero

After the first shot, I did not have any side effects or reactions when the vaccine was administered. 
THey suggest that you wait at the vaccination site least 15 minutes after being vaccinated to make
sure that you do not have an allergic reation to it. I did this and did feel anything so I left 
and went back to work.

### Day One and Two

The first and second day afterwards, my arm did feel sore. However, I only felt the soreness when I
pressed on my shoulder or raised my arm above shoulder height.

### Day Three

By day 3, all of the arm soreness had went away. No other symptoms were experienced.

## Second Shot

### Day Zero

All felt well after getting the shot. 
I did get the second shot in the same shoulder that I got the first shot in.
Like after getting the first shot, I stuck around (but was not required to) for 
15 minutes before leaving. After doing this, went back to work.

### Day One

Woke up and had full body ache as the only side effect. 
I had read where some said that they described their pain as if they had 
been hit with a Mack truck. However, my pain was not that severe. I would describe mine as the Kool-Aid Man
running through a wall when he says "Oh Yea" type ache. As the day progressed on, I began to 
experience more side effects. Chills and fever eventually set in. I checked my temperature 
several times on this day and at the peak, my temperature hit 101.3F. I also took two doess 
of store-brand Tylenol according to the package instructions (once per 6 hours) to manage the 
fever and aches. Will also add that I did make sure that I ate and stayed hydrated with orange
juice and water throughout the day.
As mentioned by others, it does have the same side effects as the flu.

### Day Two

Woke up and felt mostly fine. Still had some body aches that were on the pain level of walking 
into a glass door. The fever did go away and my temperature was in the 98 F range. Started having a 
burning or pain in my arm pit area of the shoulder that I got the injection in. 
Did not really think much of it at the time. 

### Day Three

The burning and pain in my arm pit area continued. I checked the area and 
noticed that the Lymph node that is located in the same shoulder as the injection site has swolen.
Swolen enough that when my arm is down, that it applies pressure on it and causes some pain. 

By no means am I a medical professional, but I do understand that it is the lymphatic system responsibility
to capture and isolate viruses and bacteria and redirect them out of the body. That being said, 
my body does seem to be responding properly to the vaccine. Thus why staying hydrated after getting 
vaccinated is important as the body cannot flush the bad stuff out of your system if you do not
put new stuff (e.g. water) into your system.

## Conclusion

I will continue to post updates here as the side effects and symptoms evolve.
