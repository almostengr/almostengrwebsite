When you have a desk job for a living, sometimes you get tired of 
sitting down all of the time. I know that I do. Often times when I go out and everyone around me is sitting, 
I will stand up because I am tired of sitting. 

## Walk or Exercise

It is recommended that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity 
per week, or approximately 30 minutes 5 days per week. Those that workout 
more or physical trainers may state a higher number. 

I normally go for a walk during my lunch break at work, if I bring a lunch. 
I take about a 20-30 minute walk each time, which equates to about 1 to 1.5 
miles. You may not think that is a lot, but do keep in mind that the area
I am walking in does have hills.

On days that the weather does not permit (e.g. raining) or is not 
ideal (e.g. too hot or cold) for walking outside, I have found that 
other coworkers walk on a particular floor in the building. This 
particular floor is set up in a way that allows you to do laps around it. 

At the time I am writing this article, I have not done laps around this 
floor in the building, but I will one day.

I previously write an article that describes 7 ways that you can get 
[more steps in your day](/lifestyle/2019-05-09-7-steps-for-more-steps).

## Water Intake 

When I am working on the computer, majority of the time I am consuming 
water. Occasionally I may drink something different like tea or juice, 
but the preferred choice is water. 

## Watch What You Eat 

No I do not mean that you watch the food as you put it in your mouth. 

## Intermittent Fasting

Fasting? You are starving yourself. No, I am not starving myself.

There are several intermittent fasting strategies. The most common is the 16:8, where you do all of 
your eating within an 8 hour time period. The remaining time of the day you don't consume anything OR 
you consume only water, tea, or black coffee.

Now before considering any fasting method, make sure you are in good health. If you are not in 
good health or if you have you any chronic diseases or conditions, then consult with your doctor before 
you change your eating habits.

### My Fasting Method

I do the 12:12 method. Where I eat within a 12 hour window and fast for 12 hours. Now in doing this, 
sometimes that 12:12 ends up being a 16:8 or 18:6 because of when I start eating. If I start my 
day off by drinking sufficient amounts of water, then I am able to go for a longer amount of time 
between waking up and eating my first item (not necssarily a meal) of the day.
