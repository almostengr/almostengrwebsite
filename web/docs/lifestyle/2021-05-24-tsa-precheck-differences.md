## Background

I took my first flights after being approved for
<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/precheck" target="_blank">TSA Pre-Check</a>.
I signed up early in 2020, and then boom... COVID hit. Thus I lost an entire year of Pre-Check because
it was not safe to travel with a lot of other people.
Since I was not traveling by myself, I
chose not to use the dedicated Pre-Check line that is available at the airport. My experience
for getting through security varied as I traveled through multiple airports to and from my destination.

In each of the airports, I went through the general security checkpoint and not the Pre-Check Checkpoint.
Some of the things that were common at all of the airports when going through the security checkpoint:

* had to pull down your face mask so they could see your full face when comparing your ID
* had to have a mask on to be allowed through the checkpoint

## What Is TSA Pre-Check?

<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/precheck" target="_blank">TSA Pre-Check</a>
is a program that you can request to be pre-screened for flights. When you go through security,
you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. You are also allowed to leave your laptop or
other electronics in your carry-on baggage.
Ideally, this program is designed for people that fly frequently as it allows you to get
through the security checkpoint faster.

In order to sign up for
the program, you have to apply online or at an airport, get fingerprinted, photo taken, and pay the
$100 fee. If you approved for Pre-Check, you are then given a Known Traveler Number (KTN).
The KTN should be kept secret, like your social security number, so that others cannot use it.
Also, the KTN at to be provided to the airline that you are flying on. When you have a KTN associated
with your boarding pass, you will see the "Pre-Check" logo included on your boarding pass.
Then when you go to the airport, you can go through the Pre-Check Checkpoint instead of the
General Security Checkpoint.

### Why Not Clear?

The reason that I did not sign up for
<a href="https://www.clearme.com/" target="_blank">Clear</a>
is because every airport does not have Clear available.
However, majority (if not all) have Pre-Check as Pre-Check is a program overseen by the
TSA (Transportation Security Administration). Clear is a
service provided by a private company, thus its implementation at an airport has to be approved by the
TSA and that airport's governing body.

## Pre-Check at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)

I believe due to COVID and probably other reasons, 
<a href="http://atl.com/" target="_blank">ATL</a> was doing a modified version of
security screening. This version,
they gave everyone the Pre-Check protocol for going through security. This means able to keep
shoes and jackets on. Also not having to unload larger electronics out of your bag. They had people go
through the metal detector as well as the body scanner. From what I could tell, there was not a method to
how they determined what device you went though.

### A Specific Type of Mask

One thing that really stood out to me was that they were picky about the type of mask that was
worn through the checkpoint. I normally wear 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086QPYR94/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B086QPYR94&linkCode=as2&tag=rhtservicesll-20&linkId=c597e32d0f787b7a665e296e135e1e44" target="_blank">neck gaiters</a> as a mask because they do not pull
on your ears. At this checkpoint, the agent said that I had to wear one that goes around the ears
because that's what was preferred and that I could switch back to my 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087PNPR48/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B087PNPR48&linkCode=as2&tag=rhtservicesll-20&linkId=13e774c9189b83ce35fea23549a13a02" target="_blank">neck gaiter</a> once I got
through the security checkpoint.
She then proceeded to give me a cloth mask that they had for people who did not have masks.

Thus... the government gave me a mask.

## Pre-Check at Denver International Airport (DEN) and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA)

After scanning my boarding pass and the agent verifying my ID, I was given a red
laminated card 
(<a href="https://flysea.org/" target="_blank">SEA</a>) or piece of paper 
(<a href="https://www.flydenver.com/" target="_blank">DEN</a>)
that identified me as being Pre-Check approved. Thus I was able to go through the general security checkpoint
and get the benefits of Pre-Check like not having to take my shoes off, being able to keep
my jacket on, and going through the metal detector instead of the body scanner.
Only thing that it did not get me was access to a shorter security line.

## Pre-Check at Chicago-Midway International Airport (MDW)

There was no modified measures here. The TSA agent at the gate asked if I knew that I had Pre-Check on my
boarding pass. I told her that I did and that some of the other airports would give you a card
that noted it if you were flying with others. She said that they did not do that at 
<a href="https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">MDW</a> and that I would
be subjected to the same screening as everyone else since I was going through the general security checkpoint.
That was not music to my ears, but the band played on. It just so happened that they let some older 
people who primarily used a wheelchair to get around go before myself and others through the body
scanner, which resulted line backing up almost immediately. Once the agents realized that the line 
was not moving because of the elderly, they let a number of people, myself included,
go through the metal detector instead of the body scanner. Essentially I got some of the benefits of 
Pre-Check, but on a technicality.

## Conclusion

It was very interesting to see how different airports do the same checks differently whether you have
Pre-Check or not. Especially since the airports have to follow the same federal rules for
screening passengers.
If I am traveling by myself next time, I will try to go through the Pre-Check
line so that I can receive the full benefit of having Pre-Check.
