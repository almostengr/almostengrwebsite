Black Box Operations is a project management, help desk, and invoicing system all rolled into one. This
web application allows BBIT staff and BBIT clients to stay up-to-date with the status of their project and
submit maintenance requests for their website(s). The system also emails invoices to clients and allows
clients to login to pay their invoices. By having all of the information located in a central location,
BBIT is able to produce quality work, in a timely fashion.
