I wanted to do something different for Christmas. Given that the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic was happening 
during this time, I had extra funds on hand since I was not doing much travelling during this time. I decided 
to leverage my tech and Electrical Engineering skills and build a Christmas light show. 

More details about the project, as well as the video of the 2020 light show, 
are available on the [project page](/lightshow).
