# Free Software for Web Development

Here is a list of some of the free, some which are open-source, software that I use for web development. An internet search will provide links to download the software. 

* Filezilla (FTP/SFTP client)
* Firefox (browser)
* Google Chrome (browser)
* Image Analyzer (image editing)
* Notepad++ (coding and text highlighting for various languages)
