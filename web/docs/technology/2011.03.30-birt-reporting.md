# BIRT Reporting

If doing a BIRT report and you get a "+ There is no report design object available." error, then you have a version incompatibility. Chances are, there version of BIRT that you designed the report with, is newer than the version that is running on the server as it was in my case. In my case, the report designer was version 2.6.2 and the server was version 2.5.1. Updating the version on the server will fix this problem.
