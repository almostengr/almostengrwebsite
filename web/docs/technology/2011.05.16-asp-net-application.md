# ASP.Net Application Errors

I've been working with an ASP.Net application. 

After publishing the application and moving it to the server, initially I would get an error message saying that the application was unable to run and to add some code to the web.config file. 

The code stated something about enabling CustomErrors.  More information about the CustomErrors tag can be found here
