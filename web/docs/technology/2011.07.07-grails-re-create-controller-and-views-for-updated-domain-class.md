# Grails - Recreate Controller and Views for Updated Domain Class

I did some work with Grails (version 1.3.7) and Groovy today. I use SpringSource ToolSuite as my IDE. 

If you change the variables in the domain class, then you will have to update the controller and views in order for the new fields to be shown/remove. To update the controller and views with new variables in the domain class, you must execute the "generate-all" command to re-create the controller and views with the added/removed variables. 

In the worse case, delete the controller and views and then re-add them by using the "generate-all" command if using the command prompt or by right clicking on the project > New > Generate Controllers and Views if using the SpringSource ToolSuite.
