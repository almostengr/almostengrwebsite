# Ubuntu Server

Recently managed to setup an Ubuntu 10.04 server for my business Black Box Innovation Technologies (http://www.blackboxitech.com).  It uses LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for our hosted websites.

There were some things that I had to learn since the websites that we host were on a Windows XP based computer using XAMPP. 

I'm currently trying to add more features to the Linux server, including a mail server and LDAP server, but I'm currently having trouble doing so. I've looked everywhere, but the tutorials do not seem to be of much help.  Hopefully I will figure out soon.
