# Setup LDAP on Ubuntu 10.04

I attempted to set up and LDAP server on Ubuntu, but apparently I skipped a step or missed part of the instructions because I could not get it to work.  After researching many websites, I was finally able to come up with a solution that got it to work. All of the instructions are based upon the use of a Linux command prompt (or terminal) 

## The Steps 

* Connect to your server
* Enter ```sudo apt-get purge slapd```
This will clear your existing slapd configuration if you have one.
* Enter ``` sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils  php5-ldap ```
This will re-install slapd with the initial configuration and install ldap-utils and php5-ldap packages if you do not already have them
* Accept any dependencies necessary.
* Copy the script located at http://www.blackboxitech.com/it_help/ldap_script.txt to your server. When saving the file, name it ldap_script.sh and save it in a directory that you have access.  ( I don't know who initially created it, so I don't know who give credit to)
* Give the script executable permissions by running the command  ``` chmod u+x ldap_script.sh ```
* Edit the file look for and edit the following lines:
```sh
passwd=pleaseeditme
dc1=pleaseeditme
dc2=pleaseeditme
```
In my instance, I changed the lines to
```sh
passwd=mypassword
dc1=blackbox
dc2=local
```
* If you wish, you may change the lines towards the end of the
script so that the first user that is added, has all the necessary 
fields of your choosing. I chose to not modify the fields so that at least one user is added correctly. 
* After you have finished making all of the changes, run the command  sudo ./ldap_script   You will see the script run and it may prompt you for your password.
* Enter the command ``` ldapsearch -x -h localhost -b "dc=EXAMPLE,dc=COM" "(objectClass=*)" ``` where EXAMPLE and COM match the entries that you included in the file.  You should see the results of your LDAP server.
