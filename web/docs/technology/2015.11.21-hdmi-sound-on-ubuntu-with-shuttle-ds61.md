# HDMI Sound on Ubuntu with Shuttle DS61

If you have issues getting the sound to work using Ubuntu via HDMI, perform the following steps in order: 

* 
Confirm that the volume on your computer is not on mute.

```
pacmd
>> list-sinks
```

It the volume is on mute, you will see an entry that states "mute: on". Otherwise you will see "mute: off".

* Add your user the the audio, pulse audio, and video groups. Replace "userID" with the ID of the user.
```
sudo usermod -a -G audio,pulse,pulse-access,video,voice userID
```

You would think Ubuntu would be smart enough to automatically do this, but apparently not. 

* Install pavucontrol
```
sudo apt-get install -y pavucontrol
```

* Install the ALSA drivers and add the repository to your system.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/alsa-daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oem-audio-hda-daily-dkms
```

* Reboot your computer
* Force reload the drivers into ALSA.
```
sudo alsa force-reload
```

* Go to System Settings > Sounds.  On the Configuration tab, change the Profile option to HDMI.
* Play an audio or YouTube clip to confirm that the sound is working.
