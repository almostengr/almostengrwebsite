I was recently looking into whether it was possible to write commit messages without actually commiting files.
Come to find out, it is possible. You're probably thinking, why would one want to do this? There are couple
reasons that I could come up with.

## Trigger CI/CD

One of the most common reasons to do this is so that you can trigger the CI/CD workflow after a failed run. In 
some situations, a run may fail for reasons other than the code. For instance, a server may not be responding
or is offline.

You're probably saying, just go in the workflow tool (Jenkins, DevOps, GitHub Actions) and manually trigger the 
work flow. In some set ups, only certain individuals are allowed to trigger workflows manually, such as 
system admins or team managers. Access control is a big thing, especially in larger organizations.

## Updating Issues / User Stories

In my case, I have been trying to be more proactive about closing the GitHub Issues with commit messages 
instead of using comments on the issues themselves.  Why is that the case? Because it associates the issue
with the commit. Having the issue associated with the commit is helpful when tracing when bugs or 
defects were introduced into the code.

## How To Commit Without Files

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "My commit message"
```
