If you have a static website, here is how to make those updates.

Before making updates, please be familiar with the Markdown language. You can reference the
<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet"
target="_blank">Markdown Cheatsheet</a> if you are unfamiliar with the language.

* Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and login.
* On the left of the screen, click the name of the repository that corresponds to the website that you
want to update.
* You will be taken to the repository page where it will show files and folders. All of the
webpage files are located in the "docs" folder. See [Where's the File](#wheres-the-file) section for
more information.
* Click the file that you want to update.
* On the screen that appears, click the pencil to make changes.
* Once you have completed making the necessary changes, then click the "Commit changes" button.
* The process to update the live website will begin. You can see the process by going to the Actions tab
near the top of the page. See [Update Indicators for more info](#update-indicators).

### Update Indicators

* It is still running if there is a yellow circle showing or spinning.
* If the update completes successfully, then a green checkmark will appear.
* If the update fails, then a red "X" will appear.

**NOTE:** Updates usually take about 2 minutes to complete. This will take longer if you have over 100 
pages on your website.

### Where's The File?

The files on the website that are converted into web pages are in the docs folder.

* If the URL of the page that you want to update is
```thealmostengineer.com/photos/```, then the file that corresponds to that would be in ```docs/photos.md```.
* If the page that you want to update is ```thealmostengineer.com/about/services```, then the file that
corresponds to that would be in ```docs/about/services.md```.
