## Background

I needed a monitor stand at my office. At home, I have my monitors elevated so that I do not
have to sit slumpted over to see the screens. At the office, I did not have this liberty.
When I inquired about whether stands could be purchased, I told that it would be a lot
of hurdles to get those added. However, I was allowed to bring my own monitor stand. Thus
I chose to build one instead of buying one.

I recorded a video discussing this project. You can watch the video below.

## Materials and Tools

### Materials

* 1 - 1 inch (25.4 mm) x 8 inch (203.2 mm) board

## Video Transcript

what's going on fellow engineers
in this video i'm going to show you how
i built
this monitor stand so 
welcome back to the channel so today is
saturday
so of course that means gotta do a
saturday project
now granted i will admit it took me
longer than
just a saturday to complete this project
but
i did manage to build a monitor stand
for
my desk at work so i'm gonna walk you
through the steps that i took
to build this stand here we go
[Music]
welcome back to the engineer channel
try that again
today is saturday which means it's time
for a saturday project
this video i'm going to actually discuss
how i went about building a
monitor stand for my desk at work
i know this is actually i did this
project
before the whole quarantine and
coronavirus situation
but it's still relevant because i'm
still having to go
to the office on occasion to do some
work
that being said i'm gonna discuss this
let's get into it
all right so to start off with this
project obviously you need
some wood to build the monitor stand
with and i went with i believe
it was i first had to measure the base
of the
monitors itself and uh the base was
roughly about the size of my hand
which was like six inches so i went up a
step
and so obviously you can get a uh wood
in
like increments of two inches so one by
two one by four one by six and so forth
so i went with a one by eight piece of
wood
for this particular project and it was
just basically
it's the same material that you use to
make the
closet shelving or just a basic
shelving material so nothing fancy
and now if you are particular about the
type of wood that you use
you can go get the oak or the cedar or
whatever the case might be
i wasn't that particular about it so i
just got a piece of wood
and i was able to get it i had to do the
dimensions
and if you look at the monitors
so i have a two monitor setup each one
of these monitors
is 21 inches in width
and so 21 and 21 means 42
and i wanted to a little bit of overhang
beyond that
so uh i think i measured 42
i think i measured it to be 48 inches
which is 4 feet
so it's four feet across and then i
built the
vertical supports and i'm getting to
that as well
some other things that you'll need for
this project you will need some wood
stain
uh maybe even a polyurethane to protect
the wood itself once you apply the stain
and i also use
pocket screws on here the kreg
pocket screws so that i can make the
holes
in here as neebie
all right so once you cut them off uh to
be able to make
my vertical supports the same height i
lined the bottom ends up together and
then i
flushed off the top sides so that they
were exactly the same height
sometimes when you cut you know you may
put your mark here but if your line is
slightly off then when you go to cut
you may get some unevenness so i did it
this way worked perfectly fine
all right the next step although this
picture is relatively blurry
i did cut the pocket holes here
and i was testing it out and i kind of
made a little bit of a mistake on one of
the pieces so i had to go back and
correct it
but i did put pocket holes in on the
these are the verticals as you see right
here
and this is the horizontal support that
goes across and then i have another
vertical on this
end i'm also using some corner clamps
to make sure that the corner is
at a right angle and what you can't
really see
here is that the
well i've actually already had done it
at this particular step but i used a
scrap piece of the 1 by 8
or 1 by 10 to be able to inset
this vertical piece back if you can kind
of see down here
in this particular corner you'll notice
that this
piece of going across does not meet the
very end of this piece going up and down
and that's because of the spacing that i
put there before i secure them together
as far as the pocket holes go i use the
standard
uh you know recommendation that was made
that craig makes for them and they
recommend
two holes for every i believe is
two inches or every three inches or
something like that nature
um so i went with that standard
all right once i got everything
assembled i also use
uh glue in between the pieces some wood
glue so
as you see here the top is glued to the
vertical supports as well as the front
horizontal support
and to i didn't have big enough clamps
that would clamp from the top of the
shelf to the bottom
and so what i did is i just stacked a
bunch of paint cans
on top of it and let it sit overnight
this did the job you know pretty well
for what i was
doing but if you do have the clams i
would suggest
using the clamps that you would need
all right and here's a different angle
of the clamps so i was able to get the
clamps on the back side
across the vertica support and the top
but not from the actual
full length of the the full length
vertical
to the top it was not long enough
all right the next thing i did was to
apply
stain and this is a min wax product
that has a stain and polyurethane mixed
in together
and so i applied it and it went on
pretty smooth
uh the only problem that i had was that
it didn't look like
as well as i thought it would when it
came out and maybe it could have been
just how i went about
doing things like i followed the
instructions on the can
of how to go about applying it and so
forth but
it didn't turn out as great as i would
hope it would
but it is you know it does look well as
you see
the grain is popping out here you know
pretty well
so you can make out that it has been
stained and so forth
one other thing i wanted to mention that
before i stained it i did
use a sander to round off the sharp
edges
of the you know various pieces of wood
in hindsight though when it comes to
staining i
would have for you know any future
projects
i would make it a habit to actually
stain the wood first
before assembling it and the reason
being is because
i had some runs on the wood
from where like i applied the stain and
as it dried
it ran down the surface of the board
and so you can see those runs on there
and this is the final part before i
completed everything
so i let it dry for maybe two or three
days
even after drying for those two or three
days in the garage
once i took it to the office it still
had a smell
from the stain and the polyurethane on
it so
i would recommend probably letting it
sit for at least a week
in an open area to kind of get rid of
all the fumes and stuff
off of it and again this
is the final product of it being
assembled at the office
with the two monitors on top um
one thing as a kind of a lesson learned
from this particular
project i wish i had a built it a little
bit taller
as you see i have the monitor that i
normally take
you know my work computer uh it's not
able to stand
completely up like the screen is not
able to stand completely up
um so i could use it as possibly like a
third screen
and you know i've measured it tall
enough to be able to get
like my work phone underneath there and
maybe
you know a couple other things under
there but not tall enough that
the monitor the laptop itself could fit
under there
with the screen open but overall
i i did enjoy this project it was fairly
simple piece of
project to do nothing too complex i
don't think
that you know if you just really have
like a saw
you can use them i use the miter saw but
even if you don't have a miter saw you
can use a circular saw for this
particular project
and you know you may have to use like a
square or something to make sure your
ends are straight but it did work you
know
very few tools needed so if you have any
questions for this
feel free to drop a comment in the
comment section below if you've done
some woodworking of your own or have
your own monitor stand that you built
i would love to see pictures of it you
can tag me in those pictures on
instagram and twitter
my name is almost engr on those two
sites
if you have any other questions
feel free to reach out about those and
last but not least please check out my

may have some more details on this
particular project that you can read out
of read up on

until next time peace out
