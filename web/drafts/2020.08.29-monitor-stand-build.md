## Background

I needed a monitor stand at my office. At home, I have my monitors elevated so that I do not 
have to sit slumpted over to see the screens. At the office, I did not have this liberty. 
When I inquired about whether stands could be purchased, I told that it would be a lot 
of hurdles to get those added. However, I was allowed to bring my own monitor stand. Thus 
I chose to build one instead of buying one.

I recorded a video discussing this project. You can watch the video below.
