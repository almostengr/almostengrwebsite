## Background

I took my first flights after being approved for TSA Pre-Check. Since I was not travelling by myself, I
chose not to use the dedicated Pre-Check line that is available at the airport. My experience
for getting through security varied as I traveled through mutliple airports to and from my destination.

In each of the airports, I went through the general security line and not the Pre-Check line.

## What Is TSA Pre-Check?

TSA Pre-Check is a program that you can request to be pre-approved for flights. In order ot sign up for
the program, you have to undergo a background check, get fingerprinted, photo ID taken, and pay the
$100 fee. If approved for Pre-Check, then you are allowed to go through
a lower level of security at the airport.

I signed up early in 2020, and then boom pandemic. Thus I lost an entire year of pre-check because
it was not safe to travel with a lot of other people.

## Pre-Check at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (ATL)

I believe due to COVID and probably other reasons, ATL was doing a modified version of security. This
version, they gave everyone the pre-check protocol for going through security. This means able to keep
shoes and jackets on. Also not having to unload larger electronics out of your bag.

## Pre-Check In Denver (DEN) and Seattle-Tacoma (SEA)

## Pre-Check At Chicago-Midway (MDW)

There was no modified measures here. The TSA agent at the gate asked if I knew that I had pre-check on my
baording pass. I told her that I did and that some of the other airports would give you a card
that noted it if you were flying with others. She said that they did not do that at MDW and that I would
be subjected to the same rules since I was going through the general security screening line.

## Conclusion

Very interesting to see how different airports do the same checks differently.
