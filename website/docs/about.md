## "The Almost Engineer" Explanation

You probably are wondering how did I come up with
The Almost Engineer name. I work (and according to some live in) in the engineering-related field
of Computer Science, have great problem solving skills, and enjoys fixing things instead of paying
someone else to do it for me. However, I have a Business degree from the University of Alabama
(Roll Tide!) instead of an engineering degree, thus almost being an engineer.

## Programmer in IT (Information Technology)

My day job is working as a programmer and I have years of experience in building web based
applications and providing software support. When you create or maintain software for a living,
often times you will reuse the same code over in multiple projects. By using a blog, you can search for
that [code snippet](/web-development/2020.08.25-select-list-of-times)
and copy and paste it in. In addition, it assists other developers with their coding
projects, as it may be exactly what they are looking for.

## Why Does Kenny Blog?

I have been been blogging about gardening, [Christmas light shows](/electronics), 
[building software and web applications](/web-development), [life as a dad](/dad-life),
[about life](/junk-drawer), and mishaps for several reasons:

* you learn from your past mistakes
* others can learn from your mistakes before they make them
* you will forget what you previously did, but a quick search of the blog will provide the refresher that you need to keep going
* it provides a way to share thoughts
* provides a place for project documentation
