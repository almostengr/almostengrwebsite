## A Psalm of David  

**1** The Lord is my shepherd—so I got everything I need.  
**2** He lets me chill in green pastures, leads me by peaceful waters.  
**3** He keeps my soul refreshed and shows me the right path—'cause that’s just who He is.  

**4** Even when I walk through the darkest valley, ain't no fear in my heart—'cause You’re right there with me.  
Your rod and staff? They keep me steady.  

**5** You set up a whole feast for me while my enemies just watch.  
You anoint my head with oil—my cup stays overflowing.  

**6** Goodness and mercy? Yeah, they follow me everywhere I go.  
And I’m gonna stay in the Lord’s house forever.
