Well it is very easy to migrate drupal site which you have in your computer using WAMP. Just need to follow the following steps.

* You will have to upload all the files of drupal from your computer to your webspace using ftp client i.e filezilla or cuteftp etc...
* Then login to cPanel >> go to Mysql databases >> create new database and database user and add database user in to database.
* Create database backup of your local computer in .sql format.
* Then go to phpmyadmin in cpanel and import .sql file in to the database that you have just created.
* Here is the main important part now.  You will have to edit following line in to settings.php file as specified below.

```php
$db_url = 'mysql://username:password@localhost/databasename';
```
