I wanted to have a script to ensure that the internet connection was up and 
running. One way to do this quickly was to create a script that could 
perform a speed test to do this task. In addition to confirming that the 
internet connection was working, it would also provide the speed of 
the connection.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

################################################################################
# Description: Tests the connection speed of the internet by downloading a 10 MB
# file from the internet.
