I found some notes that I had previously taken. I believe these were notes that I took during a session at 
the NSBE Convention in 2019 in Detroit, Michigan. Since these notes were handwritten, decided to create 
a blog post so that I have a digital copy of the notes. The note was originally date for 3/29/2019.
From what I can gather about the notes, this was a session on preparing for the career fair, or interview 
preparation session.

Almost 6 years after I took the notes, I come across them while cleaning up. Probably should clean up more often.
