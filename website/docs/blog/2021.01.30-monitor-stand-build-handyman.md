## Problem

I needed a monitor stand at my office. At home, I have my monitors elevated so that I do not
have to sit slumpted over to see the screens. At the office, I did not have this liberty.
When I inquired about whether stands could be purchased, I told that it would be a lot
of hurdles to get those added. However, I was allowed to bring my own monitor stand.

## Solution

I chose to build one instead of buying one. I recorded a tutorial on how I went about doing this project. 
It did take some time getting used to, but the assembly was rather straightforward. I did my best to get
pieces of lumber that were cut to the appropriate dimensions, so that I could reduce the number of cuts
that I had to make.

Materials used are listed below. How it all came together is in the video above.

### Materials

* 1 - 1 inch (25.4 mm) x 8 inch (203.2 mm) board
* 1 - 1 inch (25.4 mm) x 4 inch (101.6 mm) board
* Kreg pocket screws
* wood stain
* wood glue

### Tools

* drill (for pocket holes)
* paint brush (for applying stain)
* clamps
