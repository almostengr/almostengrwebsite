## Transcript (Unedited)

what's going on good people this video
i'm going to continue building out a
coding challenge that i did with the
password generator some time ago
what i want to be able to do is to have
this password generator
be able to spit out multiple passwords
at
one time so basically you call the
program with
define some arguments and then it will
give you know an output
without you having to manually interact
with the program
the reason i want to do this is i want
to be able to
uh extend the functionality of the
existing program but then also be able
to do
give it everything it needs in a single
command and then it gives me everything
back and then from there i could
potentially use this
in let's say a automation script to
create users
or use it in a script for
like web driver for creating accounts or
something of that nature
and then also when it comes to the
length of the password in the
original coding challenge we had to
specify
the length of numbers letters and
symbols this video i want you to try to
get that so that if you don't provide or
if you provide a
argument it will just automatically come
up with those numbers within a given
range
and then continue with the rest of the
process
that being said let's get started
[Music]
all right so this code will be available
on github
so if you want to have a copy of it
by all means you can go to my github in
the coding challenge
repository this will be the password
generator
project and what i want to do
so this code has not been changed
it may have been modified a little bit i
think i did add a function here to
process the
inputs and what i want to do is actually
change that
so that the if a value is not
provided or if an argument is not
provided for it to randomly
figure out a number for each of these
types
then it prompts the user for
the value that should be used
so what i'm going to do i'm going to go
ahead and
copy um
let's see want to copy these
remaining lines here and
not do that all right
and let's go ahead and do format to
rearrange that
so i want to do a if um
and i guess we can specify the arguments
here and
what i like to do is when i do my
arguments i have a
function that handles the arguments
and based on those functions it based on
what arguments are set it defines
some variables in here so i'm going to
create a pra
private not practice private static
[Music]
um we'll call it void for now and then
we'll call it process
arguments and we'll do a string of
args and this is literally being called
after the password generator so we want
to do
process arguments and we are literally
passing
in what is being passed into the main so
this goes into
our process arguments function
from this uh we'll probably set
some class level variables
because um well let me write this
function out here
because i probably don't actually even
need a i'll probably
put it into a function after i get done
with everything but to initially write
all of this
out is not necessary so what i want to
do is loop over
every argument that is being provided so
i'm going to do a for
each bar argument in args
and then for uh
so what we want to do is
if argument is equal to
and we'll do a double dash um now you
can do a single dash or double dash
i'm using a linux computer and normally
when you're providing
if you're doing shorthand you do a
single dash if you're doing the
long hand version of an argument you do
a double dash
and to further demonstrate that example
so let's do a grep and
dash h which is shorthand and so it
gives you that
but as you see here even in this
shorthand help
it says try grep with the double dash
help for more information and so if i do
double dash help it gives you a whole
lot more
output so um that's kind of the
way you could do it so i could do it
with the shorthand i could do it with
the
longer hand or i could do both um
another example of this
since we are coding in net core so dot
net core dash
h gives you the help information here
and as you see here it has two options
so it has the dash
h for the shorthand and then the double
dash help
for the long hand same thing for
diagnosis
you got the dash d and double dash
diagnosis
so like i say i'm gonna i'm gonna do it
with the double dash
i can probably go back and code it later
with the single dash as an option
as well so this argument we want to do
uh we'll call it random length
and i guess we can go ahead and do
the single option as well so if argument
random length or argument is equal to
dash r we'll just call it that for short
all right
then we want to do
um i have a random down here so what i'm
gonna do is actually move this
up in the code and i'm going to put it
here
and that way i can leverage it within my
for each
so we want to do want to copy
[Music]
let's see so i need these four items as
well so what i'm gonna do
is delete these and copy
and move these
up here and so i
will so we'll initialize them to
zero um
let's see formats there we go all right
so we'll initialize them to zero
and then in here if we got random length
what i would do is do number of
letters is equal to random and we want
to set the
min range um i'm going to define this as
int and the mid range we'll set it to
3
[Music]
and then on the same line do max range
and we'll set it to
six all right so that being said with
mem range and max range
um what i'm going to do with those
values is set the range for the random
so the minimum number and i may need to
change this up a little bit
for well i'll take that back out so
let's do this
so we want our password to be a minimum
number of letters but we also want to
have a maximum number of
letters numbers and symbols usually not
just letters so what i want to do is do
random.next and um
ideally we can use symbols in there but
we want to have
a minimum length so to get
uh ideally from my experience
systems have a minimum length of 8
characters as a password and a maximum
length of like
20 or something like that nature so i
want to do a combination that would
be on the low end eight and on the high
end
let's say we'll actually go with 16
because 20 seems while that would be a
more secure password 20 is kind of
pushing
the limit of a lot of systems so to get
uh so we'll do next for
so we'll do a min value and um we'll do
eight
on this one plus letters so next we'll
do
symbols random dot next and we'll do
two and uh
four and then of numbers
random dot next is two
and four see this right
so four and four is i can highlight it
correctly
so 4 and 4 is 8 and
8 to 8 is 16 so we have our max of
let's do this again all right so here we
have
4 four and four is eight and then you
have
eight onto that so it max length of 16
on the minimum you have two
two which is four and another four which
is eight
so it will pick a password between 8 and
16 characters if we have the random
length argument specified
all right the next thing we want to do
is to
specify the number of passwords
and so in order to do that
because right now the way it's currently
set it will only generate
one password per run so what i want to
do
is to expand this and so we'll say if
argument
is equal to um
let's see really let me change the code
up a little bit so what i think i want
to do now
to make this a little bit easier i'm
going to do a switch statement
instead of if condition you can do this
with the if condition but
i think once you get to a certain number
of
if statements it becomes more efficient
to use a switch statement instead of an
if
statement so that's what i'm going to go
ahead and switch so i'm going to take
the same functionality up here
and just move it and put it within a
case
so we'll do random
length and then we'll do a
another case statement with uh dash r
and then we will paste our numbers and
so forth here
and then we'll do a break and then as
always you'll want to
specify a default condition even if
there is
nothing to do with in no action to
actually do in that default condition
i would always make it a habit of
specifying it
so then the next case will be a
um we'll call it
dash in and
above that i'm going to do case and put
a little bit more space in here
so we'll do uh num uh
we'll do count we'll call it count and
then we'll do this as
dash c that way it makes a little bit
more sense
and so we will want to do the
and i have a process input function
[Music]
um i don't want to
well i want to be able to use this logic
here
uh to make sure that it is an integer
um but i don't want it to prompt so
what i may do is for the time being i'm
gonna copy this out of here
and paste it back and then
when i get to a point of refactoring
i'll probably uh
modify the code accordingly so that it
does uh a more valid
uh it doesn't right have the same code
written in it more than once
all right so we're not writing an input
and we are taking the arguments
um for this i actually need the argument
plus
one so
uh i'm gonna have to get rid of this for
statement
and do it i equals zero i
less than args dot length
i plus plus and
for this you want to do
[Music]
args i and
if when we come down here
so we want to do args i plus
one and so what the
what this will do is so if the current
argument
is da double dash count or dash c
then we want to get the integer value
specified with
the the integer value specified after
these arguments so that's where you get
the arguments which is the current
argument plus one
which would be that specified number and
then we want to convert that into an
integer
and then we want this to be
um
we want this to be a variable
so that needs to be
[Music]
password gen count i guess or uh
pass yeah password you can
count is equal to zero and then we'll
set
password gen counts or set the out the
number specified to password you can
count
assuming that it does not throw an
exception if it does throw
an exception
[Music]
um you don't need a break statement
there
if it does throw an exception
you want the program to exit
[Music]
so
see
uh not sure how to do that here
um so what i'm gonna do i know i want
the program to exit if they throw an
invalid argument so what i'm gonna do is
actually just take out the try block for
the time being
until i have a little bit of a moment to
go back and research that
all right so just to recap what we've
done thus far so we have a for loop
and we can get rid of that statement i
have a for loop that will loop through
all of the
arguments that have been provided and
from here we'll have the
each of those values for if you provide
the random length argument
we'll do this here
if you provide the count it will do
this here and we need to do
one more um option here and so that case
will be
if dash
h and then we'll also do another one
here
where the case is help because we want
to provide some help
output and so i want to call a function
print help and do a break
and then here we'll do control dots and
we'll create a method called print help
and if we go to that definition
so this will be a combination of or
well it will consist of not a
combination
of console write lines that output the
usage so for example how we have
here this long output for
the net that's h similar in nature for
that
so what i'm gonna do is actually kind of
mimic this so we'll go
with on this first line usage and then
we'll say
um password
[Music]
generator t or
spelling is critical and then um
arguments that's on that line
then another console right line and you
could do this
console.writeline as one long string uh
to make it easier to
manage and come to think of it i
probably will just do that
so let's take this back so we'll do
a string of help outputs
and we'll do that and then um
let's see so we have that one there
do that one plus
that's not right um
wait a minute yeah that's okay so i am
missing a um
a new line i think is that correct
let's see console. no
okay i'm getting my technologies mixed
up here all right
so to do that so slash
r slash n and that's a difficult thing
to type so what i'm gonna do is
because that character turned it's a
difficult thing to type i'm going to
type a
new line and put that there
and then so that new line
and if i do a semicolon here
that error should oh i'm missing that at
the end
that error should go away there we go
all right so we have that
and then plus new line
intellisense helps makes things a little
bit easier all right so
the next thing in this part so they have
a description of what the application is
so i'm going to call it
generate a password
with the new line
rocket type there we go all right and
then we'll do another blank
new line plus new line
all right the next one is
runtime option so we have to provide our
arguments
so we have a um
what do we have we have the uh
dash h or
whoops need to put it in quotation marks
so
dash h or that double dash help
and provides
um help out
well we'll say displays this screen
um i've seen this done before i know
it's kind of a
rudimentary way of what the help is but
essentially that is what the help is is
for
it shows you the current screen all
right the next one will be the
dash r and i think that's what we called
it dash r
yeah r with random length and c
with count all right so random length
display uh generates
passwords uh
put that in parentheses of random length
and then the last one is dash c with a
count um
generates one two three
uh specified
number of passwords
there we go all right so after we do all
that
then we do help output and
remove that last one now we could do uh
formatting of this these here so that
they tab up
um kind of like how this is tabbed up
but that's a little bit more advanced so
i'm not going to get into that with this
particular video
um but what you could do it's a cheap uh
like not necessarily cheap way but a
quicker way of doing it is you space out
everything so that it lines up here
and then when you run that it will line
up correctly
all right so let's give this program a
go and um actually need to do
net run with i believe i can pass the
arguments here
um no okay so
i need to let's do
dot net build
and once it builds
all right so do clear and then cd
bin debug net core
app 3.1 and then do dot slash
password generator double dash help
and there we go so we have the help
information
here um now what should not happen it
should not prompt you for that
information
there so we're going to have to fix that
particular part
um so where are we so we are here with
the
help um
what i'm going to do is to actually move
the remaining parts of
the current main uh the current
code in main and we will move this
highlight the code use control dot and
call
uh extract method and then we'll say
um password
let's see
um generate password
that's a very good not well i mean that
is what it's doing but
probably not the best usage of that um
all right so we'll go with uh generate
password
all right there we go so
with this if
um does not need to return that value
all right so we'll also need to update
this here
and what's this needs to do is now
so if we're generating the password then
um this function needs to be called
here as well as
no take that back um
so if we do a break
uh okay this is an interesting
setup that i got myself into um all
right so outside of the for loop
if the so it needs to go outside of the
for loop because we want to go
make sure that we go through all of the
arguments and
um
if we do go through all the arguments
and
let's see if we probably need to set
another value here
and if help is
so we'll do a boolean
and call do help
and set it to false and if
come down here and if we print the help
then set do
help equal to true
[Music]
and if we did the help
so if do help is equal to
false then
we run the generate password
if it's equal to true we want to skip
over that
all right and so that will i think this
will address
that issue um as for these
if
let's see so we need to have
so the random numbers at the random
numbers so if all the random numbers
are equal to zero
then
yeah so the random number is equal to
zero we want to skip over the
processing of the input so i'm just
going to add if
um really you don't have to check all of
them because if
one is equal to zero is not equal
uh no if it's equal to zero
then we want to prompt for all of the
values because
by default these uh variables will be
zero all right and then i did it right
yes all right so oh so that's the output
variable
i'm not sure why it specified it to be a
oh i know why
because we're passing it in but it
doesn't need to be an out variable
so let's change this these outs
to just be variables passed in
because what is happening is the it
because i use the
extract method thing it assumed that
these would be out variables and would
be reused
in the main function but in this
particular scenario that's not true
all right so we're only checking the
number of letters so
um because we're only checking the num
of letters uh
yeah that should be sufficient all right
so let's go back so we're here
and we want to if we're just performing
the help test then we want to skip over
that
um i know some people are you're
probably watching this and be like why
is he having set that equal to false
well you could also do this because i
know some people prefer to do
this with their code and it's
essentially the same thing but my
personal preference is
when you're doing these type of
statements um
it's very easy in some programming
languages
this one net core not necessarily being
one of them but it's very easy to
see what i have highlighted here as a
single variable instead of an
exclamation point with a variable next
to it
so i try to refrain from doing that and
i prefer to write
my when i have these type of conditions
i prefer to write it
equal to false to make it clearly
evident that you are looking for a false
condition
here instead of this uh exclamation with
a variable name
which is basically a not statement so
if do help is not equal to true
which is basically saying if do help is
equal to false um
so you know i try to avoid what is known
as
uh i think it's called like an inverse
condition um
that's one of the if i recall correctly
is mentioned in
rob robert martin's uh clean code book
about using inverse conditional
statements
because the logic behind it is kind of
confusing like you can see it and
process it
when you're actually trying to process
your you know think your way through it
uh it can be rather confusing to
uh process and try to get correct so
now that i've done with that spill all
right so everything else
should be working as it should so if you
come back here and
do uh
i don't know if i can do net build from
this directory and i can't
all right so we'll go back to the
password generator
and do net build
and i'm going to do is open
a new tab in my ssh session
and then we'll go to that build
directory
so dotnet bin
all the way down dot slash
password generator double slash help
and there we go and then if i do a
uh dash h it should give me the same
output and it does so we know that the
help screen is working the way it should
be
[Music]
um
yeah there we go all right so the next
part is to
[Music]
we're going to double check your logic
right quick and then try to run this
and see what happens when we run it um
so just to make sure so we have our
number of letters all being set so
we have here the number of letters is
equal to zero
but because we're giving it random
values if the argument is passed this
should never equal zero
um it well all of these should never
equal zero but in specific
specifically we're checking the number
of letters because that's the one that
we're
just only checking um you could write
this if condition to check
each one of these values to make sure
that they're not equal to zero
but because of what we have here
if the number of letters is not equal to
zero
it is very unlikely unless something you
know uh
memory exception or something else
occurs that these other two variables
would be zero
and even if then that something like a
memory exception would occur
it would throw that exception and
probably wouldn't even execute these
last two statements
um when generating those random values
so
the rest of this code wouldn't even run
all right that being said um
the other thing we need to do is to have
uh so let's set password drink out to
one
because not a think about it the you
want this to run
at least one time um and so if i do
this here so a for statement
and i want to ant equal zero
while i mean excuse me not it um
let's call this so we got password gen
count
uh there
let's see we'll stick with i i don't
think i have an
i in this i do have an i in this so i
can't use i
well nope i'm sorry so this i is for
that loop so i can do i here again um so
if i
equals zero i less than uh
password gen counts and
i plus plus and then we want to do the
generate password
and do format and also do trim real
quick
all right and so just to recap so
when if a user passes in
the argument of double dash count or
dash c
we wanted to convert this to a
n32 and what i'm gonna do here is
so i'm gonna re-enable this try catch
and
we'll say invalid input and what will
happen here
is we'll default
the password gen count
to one if an exception occurs
and i'm gonna do the same thing here um
could i have put this statement here in
a finally block yes um am i going to do
that no because then i'll have to have a
condition that will check to see if
the password jan is
equal to one or greater than one and
that's a little bit extra code so it's
easier just to drop it and set this
value here that if you have an exception
of if you throw an exception then just
default it to one
and that ensures that even if the value
that you're typing in for the count is
mistyped or uh
if if it's not an integer or if it is a
it's not entered like if you type the
argument but don't type the secondary
argument with it
that it is caught um and i guess the
other
thing with this is to also catch
i guess a general exception with this
particular
value because i'm not um
i think it's argument null
uh or argument exception
i'm not sure which one it is so we're
gonna go to an argument exception for
this
and when we test it if it doesn't work
the way
you would think it would work then
[Music]
we'll just handle it accordingly and
still set it to one
that way it will be it won't cause any
other
issues um
and we'll say error occurred because
most users don't understand
exceptions but they do understand error
um
so i'm gonna type that there error and
then do
uh open brace zero close brace
with ex dot message as the
value to replace the zero placeholder
here
and we're still going to set that to the
password account to one that way we
still get a password even if we throw an
exception
um all right
this looks like it is ready to go uh
the rest of the logic for actually
generating the password
is not changed um
we just added other things around it to
process or you know address what needs
to be done
and that being said let's go back to the
console and we'll do another net build
on this console tab
all right bill succeeded so let's clear
the screen and i'm going to do dot slash
password
generator and this time i'm going to
pass in
uh let's see we're going to do a dash r
and so it should just give me
there we go so it works so we have it
generating a random password and i can
do this as many times as i want
as you see here the length of the
password is changing
uh each time this these two times they
got the same length
which is still acceptable um this one is
a little bit longer if you kind of draw
a line straight down
you'll see that it doesn't quite hit and
this one is clearly shorter
uh i think this one is actually this one
is the minimum length of eight
characters as you see one two three four
and then five
six seven eight all right so the next
thing
is to try out the count
and so we'll do dash r
c and we'll give it a count of five
so this time we should get five
passwords
there we go and so we have our five
passwords and
they're all the same length um
and i think that has to do with the
random generator uh because the
random function when you initialize it
it
i if i'm not mistaken it uses the
current time
to get a random value um
so that is probably playing a part in
the length of the password
um well i'll take that back no because
we're actually setting
so we're setting the random link in the
beginning
and because it's set in a random length
in the beginning that means
when it does that count then it's going
to do that
each time okay
so what may needs what may
uh let's see so let's
change some of the logic here so that we
get a different
password length each time
that we do multiple passwords uh
so what i want to do is actually to move
this um
so we're going to move this to a method
uh control dots extract method
and we'll do
we'll leave that there and we'll rename
this new method to
get random
links l-e-n-g-t-h-s
there we go all right and so if we go to
the definition of that
it will set the it will get the random
lengths
and then return those back to their
respective values
but that function does not need to go
here it needs to actually go down here
in
our four and so we want to do if
random lengths is equal not the function
call come on
l-e-n-g-t-h-s is equal to
well we'll just leave it there so it is
understood that if that is true then we
want to do this
function call and set that here and then
we need to
define this as a
[Music]
need um generate a variable and we'll
call it a
not a property it's not a parameter or
is it a no it's not a parameter
so it's a
it's not a field either okay um not
seeing what
i wanted to see so we'll do bool random
lengths
is equal to false
and then here we will set random lengths
is equal to true and
not double equals that's comparison
operator
all right that should work there and
then so when we come down here
if get random lengths is
yeah so this is true then it will get
the random lanes and then we will get
random values for our passwords each
time
so let's go ahead and do a build
and if we come back over to our console
and do a run with five passwords
all right and so now we're getting five
passwords
with different links as you see here
yeah so we're getting five passwords
with different links
and that's what you should get out of a
random ising function
[Music]
let's see are there any other scenarios
that we want to test
so we're getting five so let's see what
happens if we do
the r without let me excuse me do the c
without the r
all right and so um
because we're not doing random passwords
but we are doing the count
it will prompt five times
all right so it gave that password and
so it's going to ask again
five times how many uh letters do you
want in your password
and then we'll just keep going
all right and so it asked us five times
how many letters would we like in our
password
this
does work but i do not see a use case
for
just this dash c5 option but i'm going
to leave it in there just in case
um you know i may have a use case for it
i don't foresee a use case for it
but it is useful to have it
now that we've done that let's go back
and
demonstrate the full values excuse me
the full
length name of the arguments so we're
going to do the
same function with the double dash
random length
as being passed in as an argument
and there we go so we can confirm that
that works and then if we do just dash r
we can also see that that works and then
if we do
the same thing before with a with the
count fully specified
you'll see here we get our five
passwords with the arguments
the full length excuse me the full name
of the arguments
being specified here too so
i believe this works the way that it uh
is intended um it's still saying your
password
is for each of these what could be done
is if you are specifying the
if an argument count is greater than
zero you could possibly trim this out
that way you know uh is being
you want the program to run in kind of a
headless type mode
[Music]
but i'm not going to do that right now
that may be a future enhancement to this
uh coding challenge and so you're
probably asking well what happens if you
don't pass any arguments so let's go
ahead and try that option as well
and as you see it works as it did in the
original coding challenge where it asks
you
how many of each that you want and then
it spits out a
password in the end so
that will wrap things up for this
particular video
uh this uh
i'll continue to add on to these
existing coding challenges that i've
done
so that you know how to add additional
features to your particular
application that you're building if this
video has been helpful or if you have
any questions about anything that you've
seen in this video

video comes out on tuesday i also have
videos that come out on saturday
so do subscribe do give it a thumbs up
till next time. peace
