This is the outline for my speech on Level 4 of the Innovative Planning, Manage 
Projects Successfully. I talk about what it takes to plan a community event for
my NSBE chapter, Engineering Day at the Park.

## Implement the Project

* other STEM community organizations were invited to participate and to do their own projects
* our chapter planned on doing 8 projects; we did about 6 with other organizations doing their own projects
* vendors donated food, including 30 pizzas, chips, and other snacks
* have tents for projects that are in direct sunlight
* gave out branded material

## Project Review / Lessons Learned

* do not locate Slime project table in the middle of other tables, causes major problems
* start planning project in January so that everything will be place by August; no last minute dash
* work with the school system to get the word out about the organization
* consider publicizing the event earlier. that will allow more time for the community to become aware of the event
* have more sponsors for the event
* For those that registered for the event through EventBrite, let them use that registration as part of the check in process; caused confusion with asking them to sign in instead of allowing them to use their Eventbrite registration to sign in



## Reviewer Feedback

* holding the phone can limit the use of hand gestures
* inviting the audience to attend the event next year was positive
