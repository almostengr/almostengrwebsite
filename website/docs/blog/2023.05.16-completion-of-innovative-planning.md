This is the final speech that I have to give in the Innovative Planning path of Toastmasters. Below is the outline that created 
for this speech. Goal of this speech is to give a recap of how this course has impacted you, changes that you have made, 
lessons that you have learned, and more. This is the final speech for Level 5 of the Innovative Planning Pathway.

* took me 2 years to complete. I am sure I could have gotten it done faster. 
* did not rush in the beginning, but as I got close to Level 3 of the Pathway, I set on doing one speech per month

## Accomplishments inside of Toastmasters

* increasing the online presence of the chapter
* recording videos to allow fellow members critique themselves
* holding Public Relations position within chapter

## Accomplishments outside of Toastmasters

* found that some of the curriculum, I had already completed the tasks; just a to write a compelling speech about what I had already done
* example: already have online presence with YouTube and Tiktok
* example: held leadership positions to lead people to the completion of a project; scholarship, engineering day at the park
* record videos with fewer edits, which saves time getting them published
* used my blog as a way to keep track of the speeches and review notes from the previous speeches

## How much learned and gained

* learn to talk without having teeth collide; braces
* standing to give a speech is different that sitting
* having an outline makes it easier to stay on topic when creating videos; it helps prevent rambling
* more conscious about using "filler words"; instead will replace those words with momentary pause or another phrase that can fill the void
* pay more attention to what I am saying, even in casual conversations
* time constrained speeches, mean that you have to get to the point quickly
* gained more followers
* pay more attention to my facial expressions; told about me not verbalizing but face says it all

## Next steps

* continue to do speeches in the form of content
* will be creating online courses, thus the outlining of speeches will help with that; also avoiding filler words will make it less painful to watch

## set new Toastmasters goals

* find another path to complete and start on it

## Evaluation

* was gvien good feedback 
* need to have notes, outline larger, so that i was not having to look intensely to find my place 
* constant hand movement can be distracting
