## Why I joined toastmasters

* when you have an online following, being able to speak well is a key component of being a content creator
* working with customers, have to be able to present problems and fix issues
* picking a Path is designed to align the skills that you have and put them together in different ways

## Why Presentation Mastery path

* online audience is different than in person audience
* when online comments come afterwards, not during; thus being able to manage the unexpected

## Goals

* objective is to be better at giving presentations
* there's money to be made with giving presentations, both directly and indirectly
* online speaking, results in royalties; generational wealth
* in person speaking, results in conference invitations, seeing new places, and having new experiences
* envolving how I present and share information currently, and improve it with the lessons learned from this Path
