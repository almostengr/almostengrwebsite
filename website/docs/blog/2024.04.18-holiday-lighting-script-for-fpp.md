I use Falcon PI Player for my holiday lighting. After adding flood lights to the light show 
this past year, I wanted to use the landscape or flood lights year round for special days, months, 
and holidays. While FPP does have the functionality to schedule actions based on holidays, it does not have all of the 
holidays that I wanted to be able to accomidate. In addition, there are special months, that I wanted to 
do certain colors for. THe FPP Schedule does not have the capabilities (at least at the time of writing 
this article) to be able to do that. 

That said, I created the PHP script below. THe way that this works is the FPP Scheduler will call the script 
as the scheduled time, the script determines what day it is. Then based on the day, month, or other conditions 
specified, the selected sequence is started by sending a command to FPP and set to repeat. 

## Turn On Lights

Need to know which sequence to turn when turning on the lights. The script below will check the current date, 
get the sequence name that should be played based upon the rules, and then run the FPP command to start 
the sequence on a loop.

```php
<?php

define("DEBUG", false);

define("DATE_FORMAT", "Y-M-d");
define("BLUE_LIGHTS", "Calendar Blue.fseq");
define("BLUE_GREEN_LIGHTS", "Calendar Blue Green.fseq");
define("GREEN_LIGHTS", "Calendar Green.fseq");
define("PINK_CYAN_YELLOW_LIGHTS", "Calendar Pink Cyan Yellow.fseq");
define("PINK_LIGHTS", "Calendar Pink.fseq");

final class HolidayMapping
{
    public $startDate;

    public $sequence;

    public function __construct($startDate, $endDate, $sequence)
    {
        if (empty($startDate) || is_null($startDate)) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid start date");
        }
        $this->startDate = strtotime($startDate);

        if (empty($endDate) || is_null($endDate)) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid end date");
        }
        $this->endDate = strtotime($endDate);

        if (empty($sequence) || is_null($sequence)) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid sequence");
        }
        $this->sequence = $sequence;

        if (DEBUG) {
            echo "Start " . date(DATE_FORMAT, $this->startDate) . ", End " . date(DATE_FORMAT, $this->endDate) . ", $this->sequence\n";
        }
    }
}

$currentYear = date("Y");

    new HolidayMapping("october 1 $currentYear", "october 31 $currentYear", PINK_LIGHTS),  // breast cancer awareness
);

$currentDate = strtotime(date(DATE_FORMAT));
if (DEBUG) {
	echo "Debug enabled" . "\n";
	echo "Current date " . date(DATE_FORMAT, $currentDate) . "\n";
}

$sequenceName = BLUE_LIGHTS;
foreach ($holidayMappings as $holidayMapping) {
    if ($currentDate >= $holidayMapping->startDate && $currentDate <= $holidayMapping->endDate) {
        $sequenceName = $holidayMapping->sequence;
        break;
    }
}

$url = "'http://localhost/api/command/Start Playlist/$sequenceName/true/false'";
if (DEBUG) {
	echo $url . "\n";
}
else {
	shell_exec("wget $url");
}
```

## Turn Off Lights

To stop the running playlist, I have set a schedule within FPP to run the Stop Gracefully command at the 
specified time. Falcon Pi Player has this functionality built into it, so I do not have to create custom 
code for this purpose.

For other tasks, such as cleaning up logs and such, I run additional scripts that use the FPP scheduler at the 
specified time when the show is offline. That way, everything can be done from the user interface of FPP, and 
will not get wiped out when upgrading FPP versions.
