This is the outline for a Toastmasters speech that I gave about homes that were built in the 1970s

* asked about has house always been this way; looks like two houses that were put together based on framing
* hot water tank installed the wrong way in attic; have to crawl or squat to adjust the controls
* outlet did not work; aluminum wire connected directly to copper during renovation
* roof line on back matches, not on front
* insulation not staying in knee walls because there's no back; excess heat and cold into living space

* older houses are typcially built better; wood was different
* they do have some things that aren't allowed now, but were the norm back then
* houses during that time, weren't cookie cutter; builders were more creative
*
