One of the Toastmasters asked us what was required to make a Rolex. Most of us was thinking about the 
watch, but she was talking about the food. This food is a common snack that is given where she is from. 

I have added the recipe that she gave here, in case I want to make it in the future. Also if others want 
to make it as well. 


## Ingredients

* 4 free range eggs, beaten 
* 1/4 white cabbage, finely shredded
* 2 tablesppon vegetable oil
* 1 plum tomato, seeds removed and cut into strips 
* 1 red onion, thinly sliced
* 1 bunch fresh coriander, chopped
* 1 green chili, chopped
* 2 chapatis 
* salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 tablespoons mango chutney or other chutney
* 2 tablesppons mayonnaise

## Directions 

* Place the eggs in a bowl and season with salt and pepper 
* add the cabbage 
* heat the oil in a frying pan and pour in half the egg mixutre. Scatter over half of the tomatoes, 
ioninos, coriander, and chillies.  Cook until just set, then flip and cook until the egg mixture and vegetables
are cooked through. Top with the chapati and allow to steam in the heat. 
* Carefully lift up both the egg mixutre and the chapait, flip over onto plate and roll up once 
cool enough to handle. Repeat with the remaining egg, vegetables, and chapati.

for dunking.
