Below is the speech outline for the Toastmasters speech about 
the research that I had done about transitioning the neighborhood assocation to a neighborhood
assocation or a homeowners assocation.

## Speech Outline

* use porch lights to deter crime
* ADECA -  Alabama Department of Econoic and Community Affairs
* grant existed but had to be non profit to qualify
* Neighborhood Services wants to assist all to become non-profits, we can do it ourselves
* I researched starting via the SOS website, found out about AL Homeowners Association Act of 2016
* same requirements as non-profit corporation and more
* contacted SOS office; couldn't advise on how to proceed, suggested to contact lawyer 
* no records on file for association or anywhere else
* have to present to board and  eventually members 
* filing fees and others approximately $300
* considering filing as non-profit as other have already done

## Feedback

* good at story telling 
* good hand gestures
* volume
* adding a hook 
* useful facts 
* diverse topics (in regards to previous speeches given in the past) 
* strength in delivery
* missed using the word of the day
