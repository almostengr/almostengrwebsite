The question that was asked for today's table topic was if there was an age that I could go back to for a week, 
what age would that be and why? 

I chose to pivot the answer that I gave is that it would not be a single age, but a time period in life. For me, 
and many others, I think that we should go back to college and better pick our majors based on what we 
truly want or enjoy doing instead of what we think that we want to do. A number of people, myself included, 
have degrees in one field, but do work in a different field. 

Now to some, they may say that you are unqualified for the work that you do, but for others like myself, 
we have gained expertise beyond what that degree could hold, and developed successful careers. Some people 
have gone on to get master or doctorate degrees in the field of their careers to further solidify their 
expertise in that field. 

I would go back to that time period, to redecide the major that I would do, so that it would be better aligned 
with my career goals and to hopefully better qualified sooner.
