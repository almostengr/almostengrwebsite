I did a speech about writing and the importance of using a blog to maintain your writing skills. 
While some people choose to have a blog on their own platform, others use their writing skills for 
contributing to other platforms. The speech that I gave about this was to describe what I have 
learned from maintaining this blog.

Below is the outline for the speech, which was 2-3 minutes on the Presentation Mastery path 
for Toastmasters. This is from the "Writing A Complelling Blog" elective.

## Outline

* practice writing is important like speaking
* originally started with a place to put code
* evolved to that plus talking about life, recipes, tracking projects
* more searchable than video and pictures
* disable comments because of spam, receive direct messages instead
* ads to make money from your content

## Evaluation

* filed like book in library
* good vocal variety 
* could be longer
