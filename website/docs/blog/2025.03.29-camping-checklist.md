Decided to make a camping check list so that it is easy to remember which items need to be packed. 
This list is group by who will be attending and camp ground site options.

## Essentials

* tent
* tarp for under tent
* rubber mallet or hammer
* sleeping bags
* cooler with ice and food
* firewood
* lighter
* hatchet
* skillet
* cups and plates
* clothes
* flashlights (hand and headlamp)

## Optional

* utility cart
* rug
* chairs

## With Kids

* play pen for kids
* stroller
* kids bikes or toys
* diapers

## Sites With Electrical Connections

There are some camp sites that I have found that do offer electrical connections at the camp 
site. These are additional items that can be brought when camping at these sites.

* tv
* Raspberry Pi loaded with movies or TV shows
* extension cord
* work light
