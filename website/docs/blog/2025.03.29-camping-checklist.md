Decided to make a camping check list so that it is easy to remember which items need to be packed. 
This list is grouped by who will be attending and camp ground site options. That way it is easier 
to know what additional items to take, instead of making multiple lists.

## Essential

* tent
* tarp for under tent
* rubber mallet or hammer
* sleeping bags
* cooler with ice, food, and water
* firewood
* lighter
* hatchet
* skillet
* cups and plates / mess kit
* dish detergent
* clothes
* flashlights (hand or headlamp)

## Optional

Items that are not necessarily required, but may be useful if brought on the trip.

* utility cart
* rug
* chairs
* poncho / rain coat depending on weather

## With Kids

* play pen for kids
* stroller
* kids bikes or toys
* diapers

## Sites With Electrical Connections

There are some camp sites that I have found that do offer electrical connections at the camp 
site. These are additional items that can be brought when camping at these sites.

* television
* Raspberry Pi loaded with movies or TV shows
* extension cord
* work light
