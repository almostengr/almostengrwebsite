I have been watching videos about people that go camping and overlanding. I have decided that 
I want to build a trailer camper that the family and I can go camping in. From what I have seen,
there are many companies that have some good features. However, those also come with a 
sufficient price tag.  I'm making this list so that whenever I do get around to building the 
camper I desire, that I do not have to go back and do the research. Instead, I can review this
post and remember what I have decided on or would like to have.

# Camper Features and Equipment

* hot water using PVC with connections for sink (and maybe shower) usage; also need connection for venting and pressurizing
* turn signals on sides of trailer
* white lights on trailer for night use and for reversing
* unistrut or similar system for attaching components on the sides of trailer
* roof mounted tent with sleeping space inside
* 5 ft x 10 ft trailer; may consider 4 x 8
* on board solar
* all connections ar for 12v unless absolutely required 
* portable or onboard air compressor
* camping stove
* propane storage
* 12v refrigerator
* electrical and water connections on left side so that it can be used at RV campgrounds
* amber or red lights for night time camping to reduce bug attraction
* smoke and carbon monoxide detector
* roof vent
* unistruct roof system to mount roof top tent
