I have seen a number of people mention that a number of things that we are dealing with in present-day 
United States as being from several books. One of those books is "Handmaid's Tale" by 
Margaret Atwood. 

Having never heard of this book, I was unaware of what this book described. However, I was going to find out. 
Learning from others is a great opportunity to make yourself better. 

## Thoughts 

There are things that stand out to me in the book. These items, in no particular order, are listed below.

### The wealth and value of a handmaid, was significantly impacted by their she could concieve.  

This is stated in the opening of the book, and immediately rang a bell. He who shall not be named, came up with 
the idea that every woman that births a child would receive $5k. To those that do not know, it sounds like a great
deal. Having two kids, that is horrible. Day care for one of my kids, before any discounts, runs over that amount 
per year. That doesn't factor in diapers, baby furniture, clothes, and all those other things that babies need.
Nor does it include the doctor visits for the mother, the sleepless nights for the father, and any other 
incidentials that may occur. 

### Surveillance

There is a lot of big brother or micromanaging in this book. Those actual terms are not used in the book, 
but when the people in the book have to seek around to have conversations, it gives vibes that the maids 
in the story cannot be left to do things on their own or think for their own. 

### Forced, Ignoring the Consequences
