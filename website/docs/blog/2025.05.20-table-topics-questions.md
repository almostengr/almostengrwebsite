* If animals could talk, which one would be the rudest?
* What would be the title of your autobiography?
* Invent a new holiday and describe how it would be celebrated.
* If you could replace handshakes with something else, what would it be?
* Describe the internet to someone from the 1800s.
* What's the most embarrassing song you secretly enjoy?
* If your pet could give you advice, what would it be?
* What's a trend you just don't understand?
* Imagine you're a fortune cookie â€“ what's your fortune?
