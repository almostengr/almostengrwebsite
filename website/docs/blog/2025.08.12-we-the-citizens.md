I used this opportunity to practice the speech that I plan on giving to the city council at an upcoming meeting. 
Below are my speech notes and the evaluation received. 

## Notes

* resident called to talk about drive by
* call 911, take too long to show up 
* shot up wrong house during previous occurrence, house is now up for sale
* another house has bullet holes in the shutters
* ask for camera footage or vehicle info

* explained to my dad about having accidents that involve 3+ vehicles
* easy to blame users of system, adjust the system to reduce the case of violating constraints
* sent email asking for changes, April meeting

* see what other council members are doing, town halls and community meetings

## Feedback

* details good, great presentation
* comfortable, "yall" overused
* show passion about the topic
