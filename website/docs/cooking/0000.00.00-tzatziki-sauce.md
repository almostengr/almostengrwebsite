Needed to make some sauce for a peta that was for dinner. Since I did not want to go to the store, I used what I had in
the fridge to make a remixed version of Tzatziki Sauce.

## Ingredients

* sour cream
* salt
* minced garlic
* parsley
* lemon juice

I will admit, I did not have the same taste as yogurt-based sauce, but it did accomplish the same task by providing 
some moisture to the food.
