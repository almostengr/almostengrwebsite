On a regular basis, I will cook dinner, breakfast, or some other food. Those recipes that 
I want to document and share, I place them here. 

None of that long filler text about how elegant some dish is. Straight, to the point, with 
ingredients and instructions.

In regards to seasonings, I don't always go into detail about those, because some may like their
food spicier, or saltier, or taste different than others. That said, if you see a seasoning 
mentioned, but not the exact quantity listed, then this is why.
