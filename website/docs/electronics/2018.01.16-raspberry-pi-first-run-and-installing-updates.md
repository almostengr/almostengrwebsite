## Background

If you don't have a Raspberry Pi, this will show you what the first run of one looks like after you have flashed Raspbian to a memory card. 

This is the first run of a Raspberry Pi after installing Raspbian on the SD Card.

The following happens in the video: 

* Power on Expanding the file system and automatic restart 
* Performing software updates using apt-get (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y) 
* Reboot the system (sudo reboot) 
* Login to confirm all is working
