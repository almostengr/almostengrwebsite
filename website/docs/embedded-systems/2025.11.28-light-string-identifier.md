I decided to track the Christmas lights to see how long they would last, and to know which 
lights belonged to where. This is the numbering scheme that I came up with. 

```text
IT3.A.100.15
```

The identifier, while being in the IP address format, indicates the essential 
details about each string of lights. 

* IT3 - Inside Tree, string 3
* A - string A
* 100 - set of 100 lights
* 15 - lights first used in 2015

Each identifier is attached to the string of lights using labels made 
from my label maker. All labels are water proof, so they are able to withstand the 
weather elements regardless of the conditions.
