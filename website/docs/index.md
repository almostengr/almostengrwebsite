## My Blog

A programmer that does not talk (or in this case write) about technology probably is not a good programmer.
I share
[my code snippets](/tech-library/2022.09.17-length-of-shell-variable/),
[difficulties with coding](/web-development/2021.08.12-jquery-validator-with-parameter/),
and other things technology here.
Here I share other aspects of life, including my hobbies, and other thoughts that are not related to tech.

## Projects

When you do work that solves a problem, show it off. I have done many projects over the years. Each project
had a challenge with an end goal in mind. I share my personal projects here and the source code on
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
so that others may learn from my previous work.
Check out [my projects](/projects).
