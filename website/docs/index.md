## Featured Project - Musical Light Show

Each year, I do a musical [light show](/projects/light-show). The show consists of synchronizing
lights to music. 
More information about the project, including song information, show times, and links to previous
years show videos, are avaiable on the [project page](/projects/light-show).

To pick a song for the Light Show, go to the [Jukebox page](/jukebox).

## Technology Blog

A programmer that does not talk (or in this case write) about technology probably is not a good programmer.
I share

[difficulties with coding](/technology/2021.08.12-jquery-validator-with-parameter/),

## Projects

When you do work that solves a problem, show it off. I have done many projects over the years. Each project
had a challenge with an end goal in mind. I share my personal projects here and the source code on
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
so that others may learn from my previous work.
Check out [my projects](/projects).
