## Musical Light Show

Each year, I do a musical Christmas light show. The show consists of synchronizing
lights to music. To pick a song for the Light Show, go to the [Light Show website](https://lightshow.thealmostengineer.com).

This project is regularly brought up with my neighbors and coworkers at the office. Each year, I put up 
lights that are synchronized to music.
More information about the project, including song information, show times, and links to previous
years show videos, are available on the [project page](/projects/light-show).

## Technology Blog

A programmer that does not talk (or in this case write) about technology probably is not a good programmer.

## Projects

When you do work that solves a problem, show it off. I have done many projects over the years. Each project
had a challenge with an end goal in mind. I share my personal projects here and the source code on
<a href="https://github.com/almostengr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
so that others may learn from my previous work.
Check out [my projects](/projects).
