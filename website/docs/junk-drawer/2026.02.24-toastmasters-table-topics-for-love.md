For today's meeting, I was to come up with Table Topic questions to ask. Our chapter does a monthly 
theme. For this month, it was related to the topic of love. Also for this meeting, we were hosting an 
open house so that people can learn more about our chapter and the Toastmasters organization. 

With some prompting of AI, it provided the below questions to be asked to the speakers.

* What's one thing you love most about being part of this Toastmasters club? How has it impacted you?
* Describe a benefit of Toastmasters that you didn't expect when you first joined. What surprised you?
* Tell us about a moment when you realized you'd grown as a speaker or leader through Toastmasters. How did that feel?
* What aspect of Toastmasters do you love most—the speeches, the feedback, the community, or something else? Why?
* How has Toastmasters helped you build confidence? Share a specific example of your progress.
* What's a skill you've learned to love developing through Toastmasters that you use outside the club?
* Describe a friendship or meaningful connection you've made through Toastmasters. What does that relationship mean to you?
* What's one way Toastmasters has changed how you approach challenges or difficult conversations?
* Tell us about a fellow Toastmaster who has inspired you. What do you admire about them?
* How has Toastmasters helped you discover or develop a passion you didn't know you had?
* What's your favorite Toastmasters tradition or ritual in our club? Why do you love it?
* Describe how Toastmasters has helped you become a better leader. What's one quality you've developed?
