title: How to Replace Toilet Gasket and Bolts
description: One of the toilets was leaking between the tank and bowl section. Thus I made a video showing how to replace the gasket between the two.
---

## Background

In this tutorial, I replace the toilet gasket between the tank and bowl of the toilet. 

Using the instructions provided in the toilet gasket replacement, I demonstrate how simple it is do complete such a task. 

The toilet in the video being repaired would leak during each flush. This helped narrow down 
the number of places that the water was coming from as only certain parts of the toilet are 
utilized during a flush.  It was unknown that the bolts were as rusted as they were, but it 
was good that it was caught at this point. Had the bolts rusted any further, it could have 
led to the toilet tank coming completely off of the bowl and flooding the bathroom.

IF YOUR TOILET LEAPS LIKE THIS ON THE
SIDE WHILE YOU'RE FLUSHING THE TOILET
YOU PROBABLY NEED TO REPLACE THE GASKET
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COMING UP HOW
TO REPLACE THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND
BOLTS I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE
INSTRUCTION LISTED ON THE PACKAGING THAT
COMES WITH THE TOILET TANK GASKET AND
BOLT REPLACEMENT KIT NOW THE
INSTRUCTIONS HERE HAVE LISTED IT IN ONLY
FOUR STEPS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO BREAK IT
DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO
ADDITIONAL STEPS SINCE THIS IS A
TUTORIAL VIDEO SO STEP ONE IS TO SHUT
OFF THE WATER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF
THE TOILET THERE'S A SUPPLY LINE AND YOU
JUST TURN A KNOB TO THE RIGHT REMEMBER
RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP TO DRAIN
THE TANK YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL
THE WATER IS OUT OF THE TANK I RECOMMEND
TAKING THE LID OFF THE TANK AND MANUALLY
HOLDING THE CHAIN UP SO THAT AS MUCH
WATER AS POSSIBLE CAN DRAIN OUT IF YOU
STILL HAVE SOME WATER LEFT IN THE TANK
AFTERWARDS USE A TOWEL OR A RAG TO SOAK
THE WATER UP STEP 3
DISCONNECT A SUPPLY LINE YOU WILL BE
TAKING TWO TANK OFF THE BOWL BECAUSE TO
REMOVE AND REPLACE THE OTHER PARTS SO
YOU'LL NEED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE
REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY AND
WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE LINE THERE MAY
BE SOME WATER STILL IN THE LINE THAT MAY
DRIP OUT SO BE SURE TO HAVE A SMALL
BUCKET POT OR A BOWL THAT CAN CATCH THE
WATER OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOP IT
UP AFTERWARDS STEP 4 REMOVE THE TANK AND
A TANK BOLTS THE BOLTS IN THE BOTTOM OF
THE TANK THAT I HAVE ARE RUSTED AS YOU
SEE THE TUBE GROUND CONNECTION SPOTS AT
THE VERY BOTTOM HERE I ATTEMPTED TO
REMOVE THE RUST OFF THE TOP IN ORDER TO
GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCREW HEADS ONCE I
REMOVED THE RUST OFF THE SCREW HEADS YOU
SEE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT AS INDICATED
BY THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE THIS IS THE
BOLTS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THIS IS
THE BOLT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU
SEE THE LEFT HAND BOTH IS BASICALLY GONE
ONCE I DID GET THE BOLT REMOVED FROM THE
LEFT-HAND SIDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE WAS
PRETTY EASIER TO GET OUT SINCE THE HEAD
WAS STILL ATTACHED TO IT WHEREAS THE
LEFT HANDS I WAS COMPLETELY
DISINTEGRATED
SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS TANK THERE IS A
WASHER AS WELL AS A NUT AND YOU JUST
HAVE TO REMOVE THE WASHER AND ALL THE
WAY OFF AND THEN THE BOLT WILL COME OUT
STEP 5
REMOVE TANK GASKET THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE
STEP YOU JUST PULL THE RUBBER OFF THE
BOTTOM HERE ARE THE BOLTS THAT I DID
REMOVE THIS ONE IS THE LEFT ONE AS YOU
SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCREW HEAD ON TOP
OF IT AND THIS ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE AND
IT DOES STILL HAVE THIS RED ON TOP OF IT
ALTHOUGH IT IS DAMAGED
AND HERE IS THE OLD GASKET ON THE LEFT
AND THE NEW GASKET ON THE RIGHT AS YOU
SEE THE OLD GASKET IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER
AND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO IT BEING
STRETCHED AND BEING IN USE FOR A WHILE
THE NEW GAS THAT IS SMALLER BUT SHOULD
FIT AS IT IS MADE OUT OF RUBBER STEP 6
INSTALL THE NEW GASKET THE NEW GASKET
GOES OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND YOU
MAY HAVE TO STRETCH IT TO FIT AS I DID
IN MY CASE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO
MUCH EFFORT AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO
STRETCH IT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY
EASILY AS IT IS A RUBBER GASKET ONCE YOU
GET IT ON MAKE SURE YOU FLUSH PUSH IT
ALL THE WAY DOWN IN AN EFFORT SO THAT
THERE ARE NO SPACE OR ROOM FOR LEAKAGE
STEP 7
CLEAN THE MOUNTING POINTS AS YOU SEE THE
MOUNTING POINTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BOLT
ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE TOILET IS
VERY DIRTY AND EVEN WITH SOME BLACK
CORROSION BE SURE TO CLEAN THESE OFF AS
YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING
IS CLEAN SO THAT IT MAKES A GREAT SEAL
WHEN WHEN CONNECTED BACK TOGETHER IF YOU
LEAVE ANY DIRT BEHIND IT MAY NOT CONNECT
AS WELL AND YOU STILL MAY END UP HAVING
A LEAK AFTER YOU GET DONE STEP 8 INSTALL
THE NEW BOLTS SO BASICALLY YOU TAKE THE
BOLT AND PUT IN THE RUBBER WASHER AND
YOU PUSH IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOLT HEAD
AND THEN LAYING THE TANK DOWN YOU'LL SIT
THE BOLT THROUGH THE BOLT HOLE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE BOWL AND THERE'S TWO OF
THESE SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS PROCESS
TWICE ONE FOR THE LEFT ONE FOR THE RIGHT
THEN IF YOU NEED TO YOU CAN ADD THE
WASHER AND THE NUT ON THE BOTTOM ON THE
PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS THAT I HAVE IT
STATED THAT THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP BUT
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONFIGURATION OF
HOW THE TOILET IS BUILT SINCE MY TOILET
PREVIOUSLY HAD A NUT AND WASHER IN THIS
LOCATION I DECIDED TO INSTALL A NUT AND
WASHER IN THIS LOCATION STEP 9 INSTALL
THE TANK SO TAKE THE TANK MAKE SURE YOU
LINE THE BOLT HOLES UP
AND LAY IT ON THE OPENINGS AS WELL AS
THE TOILET FLANGE YOU MAY WANT TO ROCK
IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT JUST TO MAKE
SURE THAT THE RUBBER GASKET ACTUALLY
SEALS IN VERY WELL STEP 10 INSTALL
WASHERS AND NUTS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL
WASHERS AND NUTS THAT GO UNDER THE TANK
ITSELF THAT CONNECT THE TANK TO THE
ACTUAL PART OF THE BOWL IN THE REAR
YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THESE IN THE
FOLLOWING ORDER WITH A RUBBER WASHER ON
TOP A METAL WASHER NEXT TO THAT AND THEN
FINALLY THE NUT AT THE END BE SURE
TONIGHT OVER-TIGHTEN BEAT THE NUT AT THE
END BECAUSE IF YOU OVER TIGHTEN IT YOU
CAN CORRECT A CERAMIC ON THE TOILET AND
IF YOU PRACTICE CERAMIC OF THE TOILET
YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER TOILET IT
IS PREFERRED THAT YOU DO A HAND TIGHTEN
ONLY AS YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE
IS BEING APPLIED AND CAN STOP APPLYING
PRESSURE BEFORE THE CERAMIC CRACKS STEP
11 RECONNECT THE SUPPLY LINE SO AS YOU
DID THE DISCONNECT OF THE SUPPLY LINE
YOU BASICALLY UNDO WHAT YOU PROVEN IS
DONE SO REMEMBER RIGHTY-TIGHTY
LEFTY-LOOSEY STEP 12
TURN ON THE WATER I RECOMMEND TURNING ON
THE WATER MAYBE A HALF TO ONE TURN AND
THEN ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THERE
ARE NO LEAKS OR YOU DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS
THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TURNING FURTHER IF
YOU TURN IT ALL THE WAY ON AND IT STARTS
LEAKING THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ALL THE
WAY BACK OFF
THEREFORE YOU CREASE THE CHANCES OF
GETTING WATER ON YOUR FLOOR AND ANYWHERE
ELSE THAT IS NOT WANTED STEP 13 FLUSH
AND CHECK THE LEAKS ONCE YOU VERIFY THAT
THERE IS NO MORE LEAKS THE PROJECT HAS
BEEN COMPLETED
