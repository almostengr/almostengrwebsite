Below is the outline for the Toastmasters speech that I gave about building 
an online and social media presence. This is L4 of the Innovative PLanning Pathway.

## Goal

* Goal to be monetized on youtube
* wrote note on mirror about having passive income
* make money without having to actively work it

## What has been done 

* didn't know really what to start with, so just started in 2016 - waiting to start means that you will never startsc
* early content didnt really draw much attention

* research what others have done
* started posting weekly, being consistent with new content
* create a structure to videos - example local newscasts have news, weather, sports, closing segment
* using descriptions, cliffhanger titles, and keywords to draw greater audience and improve SEO rankings
* using comments and questions as feedback loop for what to make videos about next
* posting comments and suggetions on the videos of others
* sharing on other platforms about the channel

* started business in 2021 and sharing the videos of the work that I did
* linked business website to youtube and other social media platforms
* finally reached monetization levels

## Future

* automating channel because video editing is time consuming
* create courses related to the topics on the channel; home maintenance and technology (programming)
* additional passive income from selling digital products
* more referrals from seeing the work being done
