On occasion, I check the analytics of my YouTube channel. I had a previous conversation with Ryan Cox, 
who is a personal branding coach, in 2021 about branding myself and the projects that I was working on. 
I went back and watched our conversation again during October 2022 to make sure that I was still on track 
and making the moves that we had discussed.

One of the topics that did come up was the YouTube channel and that it was a bit all over the place. It 
clearly had suffered from a branding crisis. In my defense, it was me figuring out how things worked, and 
when I saw something that stuck, I would then continue with it.
