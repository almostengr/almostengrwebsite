Below is the outline for the speech that I gave regarding a compelling blog post.  This is the
Level 4 of Innovative Planning Pathway. This speech is to be 2-3 minutes long, so there are not many
talking points for this speech.

## Introduction

Originally, Kenny started blogging on Blogger in 2010 after seeing a presentation that every person in
tech should have a blog. Having a blog has allowed Kenny to have a greater online presence in addition to
having a online repository for tech resources for others in the community.

## Background

* blogging over 10 years
* has been on different hosts

## Technology

* website is static website
* no database, difficult to hack
* easy to maintain
* automatically backed up as source is in version control

## Content

* code snippets and lessons learned
* resources for other people that are wanting to get into tech
* links to and from my social media
* no comments, less maintenance and no spammers

* ad revenue from views


## Evaluation

* seemed knowledgable of the topic
* value point that the listener could learn from the blog 
* useful hand gestures and body language
* add intro or opening statement to the speech instead of jumping right into the topic
* can improve the speech closing by mentioning future plans or goals
