This is the outline of the speech that I gave for Level 5 of the Innovative Planning Pathway. 
The goal of this speech, is to able to design and complete a project with well-defined
goals, lead a time, and have a guidance committee to be accountable to. 

I chose to talk about the time where I was President of my NSBE chapter. The project 
was sending out scholarship applications and having the selection committee vote on who they 
thought should be the scholarship receipents.
