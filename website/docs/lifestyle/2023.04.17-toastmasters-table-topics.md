For this latest Toastmasters meeting with my chapter, I was responsible for providing the Table 
Topics for the meeting. Below are the questions that I asked. 

* With Spring comes allergies. What's something that you are allergic to or strongly dislike?
* The concept of Daylight Savings Time was to conserve energy. With LED bulbs and the Energy Star Program, does this really serve a purpose to go back and forward with time? 
* Spring time, means Spring Cleaning. What items in your house should have been removed a long time ago and why?
* Spring time means graduation season is near. What is something that you wish you had learned before you graduated?
* If adults were to get spring break off like students, where would you go and what would you do?
* The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah. What is your method for getting rid of ants?

* Other than the Easter Bunny, name and describe an animal that begins with the letter "E".
