## accomplishments inside of Toastmasters

* increasing the online presence of the chapter
* recording videos to allow fellow members critique themselves
* 

## accomplishments outside of Toastmasters

* found that some of the curriculm, I had already completed the tasks; just a to write a compelling speech about what I had already done
* already have online presence with YouTube and Tiktok
* held leadership positions
* record videos with fewer edits, which saves time getting them published
* used my blog as a way to keep track of the speeches and review notes from the previous speeches
* 

## How much learned and gained

* standing to give a speech is different that sitting


## Next steps

* continue to do speeches in the form of content
* will be creating online courses, thus the outlining of speeches will help with that; also avoiding filler words will make it less painful to watch



## set new Toastmasters goals

* find another path to complete and start on it
