The RLC was held virtually for
NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) Professionals. Here are some of the notes that I took from the
sessions that took place.

## Day 1 - General Session

* do in-person events, meetings

* collaborate with other groups; collaborations result in networking

* look for the gaps in your community
* what do people miss doing? what is happening locally?

### GBM strategy

* people that want to be involved will stay active and
* meet at company offices, hotels, libraries, college meeting spaces with NSBE collegiate
* company tours as an alternative
