For this Toastmasters meeting, I was the Grammarian. 

The word of the day, according to the Merriam-Webster website, was ambiguous. 
It is defined as 

* capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways

Prior to the meeting, I was already familiar with the word. When you are creating a database query, and have 
more than one column with the same name, if you do not specify which table and column, the database 
will return a message saying that the column is ambiguous. Meaning, you need to be more specific, like 
including the table name, so that it knows which data that you want returned. 

I kept track of how many times the word was used. In total during the meeting, it was used 3 times.
