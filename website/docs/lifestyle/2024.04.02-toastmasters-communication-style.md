### Descriptions taken from Toastmasters

As a supportive communicator, you are seen as patient, cooperative, and sympathetic. You are an active listener and anticipate the needs of others. Calm and steady, you desire a personal and relaxed environment.
Because of your dislike of change, you may appear indecisive at times. Do not hesitate to ask for more detail or information if needed.

If you score highest in the direct communicator style you are results-oriented, focused, and competitive. Motivated to get things accomplished, you are quick and decisive. Because you are independent and confident, you prefer a busy, efficient and structured environment.
Others may sometimes perceive you as impatient and demanding. Allowing others to share feelings and explain details can encourage dialogue.
