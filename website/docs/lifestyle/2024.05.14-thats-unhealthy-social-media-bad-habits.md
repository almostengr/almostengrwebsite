There are many articles that talk about how social media has had detremental effects on people. Some of these include being 
bullied online, the comparison trap, and "doing it for the Gram". 

I was having a conversation with someone the other day, and she asked why I did not view her IG Stories from the 
last several days. Those that know me, know I do a lot of lurking (meaning seeing the posts made by others, but not 
always liking or commenting on them) and post regularly. I responding by saying that I hadn't seen them and had not really 
been that interactive on social media. She continues to talk and makes a comment about how she does more IG Stories than 
Reels or Posts, because she can see exactly who has viewed the Stories. Without hesitation, I heard a voice that said 
"That's unhealthy". 

In the moment, I was not sure whether I should repeat the information that I was just told or let the other person continue 
to speak. I chose the latter because the individual was attempting to make a point. A point that I knew was bad mentally 
and sometimes physically, because of the previous research and articles that I had read about how using social media 
in the wrong way can impact us all negatively.

Here are some of the negative sides of having an unhealthy relationship with social media, regardless of the 
platform.

## Calling Out Those Who Don't Look

Just because somebody is not seeing your content, does not mean they are bad or do not care about your content. As someone that 
is a content creator, I know that content may not always hit it big in the beginning, but then a trend comes along and 
then your content gets more in engagement after being posted 60-90 days than it did within the first 60 days.
There's no need to call someone out because they did not like or support your content. Sometimes the algorithm will not 
push your content in front of a large audience until it hits a certain threshold or matches relevant keywords or hashtags.
