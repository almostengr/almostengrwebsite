This is the outline for the persuave speech that I gave for 
PATHWAYS - Presentation Mastery (L3) Persuasive Speaking (5-7 min)

## Outline

* persuade kids to do something
* look square in the face, tell what's needed and why
* wife says that doesn't work cause they don't understand
* need - child to stop screaming or correct behavior
* solutions - persuade in non-traditional ways; food in mouth mid-scream, asking to find toy
* objections - restate and reinforce
