## The "cd" command **c**hanges **d**irectory. 

### Relative or absolute directory can be provided as an argument

```bash
cd /var/tmp
```

### When no directory is specified, the user's home directory is used as the default command (often /home/username)

```bash
cd
```

### Additional information can be found by passing the "-h" argument

```bash
cd -h
```
