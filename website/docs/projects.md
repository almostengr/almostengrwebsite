People always ask what I am working on currently or what I have planned next. 
Below are the current and previous projects that I have worked
on. The source code for some projects can be viewed on [my Github profile](https://github.com/almostengr).

Projects that are listed, but do not have any details, are upcoming projects. When the details of an 
upcoming project is finalized, the details will be posted.

Have a project that you need completed? You may request 
[my services](/services) by [contacting me](/contact) with details of work that you need completed.
