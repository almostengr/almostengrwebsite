title: FarmOS NWS (National Weather Service) Drupal 7 Module
---

## Problem

FarmOS is a good garden and farm tracking software. One thing that I noticed with it is that it
required that users buy sensors for tracking of data.

## Solution

The purpose of this project is to allow
<a href="https://farmos.org/" target="_blank">FarmOS</a> to use data from the
<a href="https://www.weather.gov" target="_blank">National Weather Service</a> to allow it
to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source.

Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as
temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the
maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.
