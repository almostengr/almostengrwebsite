## Problem

## Solution

Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology.
Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home.
I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community.
The documentation for <a href="https://home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> can be
somewhat daunting for the beginnger. By providing my
configuration, hopefully it will assist you and others with their configuraiton of their own instance.

Project was started in 2017.
