title: Kdenlive to YouTube
---

## Problem

As a content creator, creating content can be a time consuming task. Wanted to come up with a way 
to improve the efficiency of this task by creating an automated way for videos to be processed 
and created.

## Solution

This project was to build an automation that would take video projects that I have created
with Kdenlive, generate them, and then upload them to YouTube automatically.

The first phase of this project, which was to render videos from a queue of
Kdenlive archive files. I have videos on my YouTube channel that discuss some of the
aspects of the code.
