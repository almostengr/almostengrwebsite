title: Ubuntu Automation Scripts
---

## Solution

The purpose of this repository is to hold scripts that use for routine tasks, such as updating packages,
starting virtual machines, and automatically commiting files. When you run the same commands over
and over again, it is often best to put them into a script and then just call the script when you need it.
I have created a playlist that contains some of the scripts used. You can 
on my 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RobinsonHandyandTechnologyServices?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>.
These scripts are designed to run on
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> 
systems. They have not been tested on other Linux-based operating systems.

Project was started in 2018
