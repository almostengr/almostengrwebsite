## Background

Webmin is a great web-based, system administration tool for Ubuntu-based desktop or servers. Since Webmin 
is web-based, you don't have to be familiar with the command line in order to make changes to the system. 

The tutorial shows how to install Webmin into your system. This setup does require the use of the command 
line to install since it is being configured to be updated with apt-get. However once it is installed, 
no command line interaction is required.

## Commands Used

```bash
sudo dpkg -i WebminFileName.deb

sudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions python
```
