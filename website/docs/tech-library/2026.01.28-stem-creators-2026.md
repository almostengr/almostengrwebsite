Groups or content targeted for or created by Black people in the IT industry. Some of the resources apply to mutliple areas of tech, while others are specific. Some groups may have a presence on multiple platforms and are noted accordingly.

For 2026, I curated a list of creators and groups that create and educate the online community about 
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). Some of those listed, I personally follow. Others are 
creators that were shared with me to be included on this list for others to follow.
