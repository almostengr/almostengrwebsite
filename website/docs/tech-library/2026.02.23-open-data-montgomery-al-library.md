## Problem

The Open Data Montgomery portal allows for users to find out information about various city services
and operations. With the release of version 2.0 of the Portal, API access was made available. That means
software developers and app builders can create custom software and applications that utilize the 
data for various purposes.

I searched online and on [nuget.org](https://nuget.org) to see if any packages or class libraries had 
been created to make API calls to the Portal, but was not able to find any.

## Solution

I decided to create a class library (or package for those who are familar with Java) that will allow 
users to create software using C# to be able to make calls using C#. 

This aids in development of my own custom software that I intend on using with the neighborhood 
association that I am a member of to be able to do analytics and trends of various data sets. The first 
of the data sets will be crime that has occurred in the neighborhood. Would like to expand it to use
other data sets such as the number of code violations reported, and traffic accidents that occur
in the neighborhood (yes we have accidents in residential areas from people running stop signs). 

More information and documentation about the Open Data library, is available in the project repository
located at
