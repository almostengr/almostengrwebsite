Yesterday I attended a meet up with other individuals in the Montgomery tech 
community. The purpose of the meet up is to network with others who are in tech 
or with those who want to get into to tech field. 

Many topics relating to tech were discussed.  Including apps that we have 
built using AI systems,
some of the experience that we have from our 9-5 work, and 
the different types of APIs (Application Program Interfaces)
that exist and how they work. 

We did have more people this month in comparison to the previous month, but none 
of the attendees where people that we had not previously met.
