title: Automatic Ubuntu Update Script
category: Technology
---

## Problem

I have several Ubuntu (Linux) computers and systems that run on my home network. Now while I could manually 
perform updates on each of these, what I decided to do was to create a script that could be placed and 
each of the computers. Then schedule a cronjob to run nightly or weekly to run the scripts and perform 
the updates. 

## Solution

I created the script below of the commands that I would normally run if I was manually updating the 
computer or server. Full paths of the binaries are included in the script, in case environment 
variables are not loaded, including the "PATH" variable.

### Automatic Restart

When a restart is required after updates are installed, there is a file that is placed 
in the /var/run directory. 

## The Script

```sh
if [ "$(id -u)" == "0" ]; then
	/bin/echo "$(date) Removing old software"
	/usr/bin/apt-get autoremove --purge -y

	/bin/echo "$(date) Cleaning packages"
	/usr/bin/apt-get clean

	/bin/echo "$(date) Updating repositories"
	/usr/bin/apt-get update

	/bin/echo "$(date) Installing updates"
	/usr/bin/apt-get upgrade -y

	# IF REBOOT FILE HAS BEEN CREATED, THEN DO REBOOT
	if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then
		/bin/echo "$(date) Reboot is required"
	fi
else
	# THROW ERROR IF NOT RUNNING AS ROOT
	/bin/echo "$(date) ERROR: Must be root to run script."
fi
```
