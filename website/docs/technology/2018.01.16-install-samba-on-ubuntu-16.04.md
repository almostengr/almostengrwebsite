## Commands 

Install Samba on your Ubuntu desktop or server. 

If you have Windows and Linux based computers on your network, having Samba installed makes transferring files between the two systems easy without having to use FTP, USB, or other file transfer methods.

Commands used in this video are below:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install samba -y

cd /etc/samba/

sudo vi smb.conf
```

### You'll edit the configuration file as described in the video. 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/video 

sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/samba/video 

sudo systemctl restart smbd.service nmbd.service
```

### Created the first folder 

```bash
cd /srv/samba/video 

ls
``` 

### The myfirstfolder should be shown.
