## Problem

While having backups are important, the problem that I had was that I would not remember to 
do the backups on a regular basis. 

The [Christmas light show](/projects/christmas-light-show) has lots of files that are used for 
it. Those that have owned a Raspberry Pi, know that the SD card can easily become 
corrupted or unusable due to power outage or other reason. I have seen several posts in the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/628061113896314" target="_blank">Xlights Facebook group</a>
and the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1554782254796752" target="_blank">Falcon Pi Player Facebook group</a>
about people trying to figure out how they can get the files off the corrupt SD card
and onto their new SD card. 

## Solution

One thing that I have learned when it comes to IT support and working in tech is that if you 
can come up with a proactive strategy for dealing with something instead of a reactive 
strategy, you will be better off and have less of a headache when it is done.

## The Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

###############################################################################
# Author: Kenny Robinson, @almostengr
# Description: Script to automatically commit the updates to the files and 
# the push them to remote repository.
###############################################################################

/bin/date

if [ "${1}" == "" ]
then
    exit 1;
fi

cd ${1}

OUTPUT=$(/usr/bin/git status)

ROWCOUNT=$(echo ${OUTPUT} | /bin/grep -i "nothing to commit, working tree clean" | wc -l)

if [ ${ROWCOUNT} -eq 0 ]
then

/usr/bin/git add .

/usr/bin/git commit -m 'Commiting new files'

/usr/bin/git fetch -p

/usr/bin/git push

fi

/bin/date
```
