title: Compress All Files with XZ Compression
author: Kenny Robinson, @almostengr

## Problem

I wanted to compress all of the tar files in the directories for video processor application.
Given the number of files, I did not want to do this one by one. 

## Solution

What I ended up doing was to create a script 
that I could run and it would loop through all of the files, which were all tar files, in the directory
and compress them using xz compression. 

GZ compress is the most common way, but after reading posts and articles, it was said that XZ compress 
can compress the tar files even smaller than GZ because it uses a different algorithm to do so.

## The Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

$(date)

for file in *
do
	echo "${file}"
	/usr/bin/xz -z "${file}" --threads=0
done

$(date)
```
