I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system. Overall the upgrade went smooth, but there was one thing 
that was off. That was the monitor setup. The computer that I have has a HDMI and a VGA port on it. 
I have two of the same monitor and created a script that allows me to override the VGA resolution for 
that repsective monitor. 

What I did to address the different screen resolutions was to have a script to run on startup that would 
set the resolution on the VGA output to the 1920x1080 resolution.

After doing the upgrade, the script no longer would work. 

```sh
$ xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
X Error of failed request:  BadName (named color or font does not exist)
  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  16 (RRCreateMode)
  Serial number of failed request:  40
  Current serial number in output stream:  40
```

After hours of searching the output text from the command, I did not find anything that would 
help me resolve this issue.

I went to the system properties to see what graphics card that my system had. On the About screen, 
it said that I had Mesa Intel(R) HD Graphics 2500 and that the Windowing System was Wayland.
After doing some more researchg about Wayland and Intel Graphics, I finally found the answer to the 
problem. 

It mentioned to edit the below file 

```sh
sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```

Inside of this file, I had to uncomment the below line in the file. 

```sh
WaylandEnable=false
```

By default, the line is commented out. When it is commented out, it is the same as the value 
as being set to true.

After updating the file, restarted the system. Then ran the script that I created below, and the 
resolution change after doing some flickering.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# steps were taken from https://askubuntu.com/questions/493165/ubuntu-14-04-unknown-display-nvidia-graphics
# and placed into a script

# https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/pzm1et/comment/hynamso/

PATH=/usr/bin/:${PATH}
OLD_IFS=$IFS

# get the mode details from the system
# cvt 1920 1080

# configure the new mode based on the resolution size
xrandr --newmode "1920x1080"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync

# Type xrandr -q to list your screen outputs

xrandr --addmode VGA-1 "1920x1080"
xrandr --output VGA-1 --mode "1920x1080"
```
