I wanted to have a way to track the containers that I have on my home media server. This blog post will serve
as a backup for those commands. As I add containers to my setup, I will update this post.

## Home Assistant

I use Home Assistant to manage the automations in my home. Some of the automations are done as part of 
a custom C# application that I will be creating to serve as a "rules engine" for Home Assistant.

```sh
docker run -d --name homeassistant --network host -p 8123:8123/tcp -h homeassistant -e TZ="America/Chicago" -v /home/iamadmin/haconfig:/config ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
```

## Plex

To stream my media and other content on the network, I use Plex. I have loaded my movie collection to the home 
server and can stream it to any device that is connected to the home network, including mobile devices.

```sh
docker run -d --name plex --network host -v /mnt/f3b457ad-29ad-492b-85ff-6e4c9719f3de/:/data -e TZ="America/Chicago" -p 32400:32400/tcp -h plexmedia plexinc/pms-docker 
```
