As I have mentioned in a previous blog post, I have a
<a href="" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>
where I post dash cam videos to. Some of these videos are of trips that I have taken, and 
other videos are of bad driving that I see. 

I recently made some adjustments to the automation that I created to process those 
dash cam videos. ONe of which was the usage of a details file. The purpose of this file, 
is to show additional text on the screen, such as the distance of the trip, which roads
were taken, and more. In an effort to be consistent, I decided to create a template 
of the details file. that way when I create future videos, the display of that information
will be consistent. 

```text
Distance:
Major Roads:
Start Point:
End Point:
```

In the future, I have considered adding additional text to be displayed throughout the video. 
However, I have not gotten to that point in my videos.
