I have been working on getting through completing a phase of the [Video Processor Application](#),
I ran into an issue. I wanted to have a enum with string values. Those of you that are familiar with 
the C# language know that that is not possible. 

Doing a search online lead me to a 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/630803/associating-enums-with-strings-in-c-sharp" 
target="_blank">post on StackOverflow</a> about how this could be done. Some of the 
comments were, in my opinion, over-engineered to accomplish such a simple task. 

Using the example that was given in one of the comments, I cam up with the code below for the 
FfMpegColor class in the Video Processor application.

```csharp
public struct FfMpegColor
{
    private string Value;
    public FfMpegColor(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public static readonly FfMpegColor Black = new FfMpegColor("black");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor Blue = new FfMpegColor("blue");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor DarkGreen = new FfMpegColor("darkGreen");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor GhostWhite = new FfMpegColor("ghostwhite");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor Green = new FfMpegColor("green");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor Maroon = new FfMpegColor("maroon");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor Orange = new FfMpegColor("orange");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor Red = new FfMpegColor("red");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor RhtYellow = new FfMpegColor("0xffc107");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor SteelBlue = new FfMpegColor("steelblue");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor White = new FfMpegColor("white");
    public static readonly FfMpegColor SaddleBrown = new FfMpegColor("SaddleBrown");

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return Value.ToString();
    }
}
```

The way that that this works is that you create a struct of a particular type. Then 
you assign that to a static property that is part of that class. 
To me resembles the way that a ValueObject is done for an entity.
