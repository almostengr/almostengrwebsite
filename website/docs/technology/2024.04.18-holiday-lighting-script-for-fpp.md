I use Falcon PI Player for my holiday lighting. After adding flood lights to the light show 
this past year, I wanted to use the landscape or flood lights year round for special days, months, 
and holidayMappings. While FPP does have the functionality to do holidayMappings, it does not have all of the 
holidayMappings that I wanted to be able to accomidate. In addition, there are special months, that I wanted to 
do certain colors for. THe FPP Schedule does not have the capabilities (at least at the time of writing 
this article) to be able to do that. 

That said, I created the PHP script below. THe way that this works is the FPP Scheduler will call the script 
as the scheduled time, the script determines what day it is. Then based on the day, month, or other conditions 
specified, the selected sequence is started by sending a command to FPP and set to repeat. 

## Turn On Lights

Need to know which sequence to turn when turning on the lights. The script below will check the current date, 
get the sequence name that should be played based upon the rules, and then run the FPP command to start 
the sequence on a loop.

```php
<?php

define("DATE_FORMAT", "Y-M-d");
define("BLUE_LIGHTS", "Calendar Blue.fseq");

final class HolidayMapping
{
    private $startDate;
    private $endDate;
    private $sequence;

    public function __construct($startDate, $endDate, $sequence)
    {
        if (empty($startDate) || is_null($startDate))
        {
            throw new Exception("Invalid start date");
        }
        $this->startDate = date(DATE_FORMAT, strtotime($startDate));

        if (empty($endDate) || is_null($endDate))
        {
            throw new Exception("Invalid end date");
        }
        $this->endDate = date(DATE_FORMAT, strtotime($endDate));

        if (empty($sequence) || is_null($sequence))
        {
            throw new Exception("Invalid start date");
        }
        $this->sequence = $sequence;
    }
}

$currentYear = date("Y");
$holidayMappings = array();
    
// dynamic holidays
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("second friday $currentYear-01", "third monday $currentYear-01", "")); // mlk day
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("second friday $currentYear-02", "third monday $currentYear-02", "")); // presidents day
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("first friday $currentYear-05", "second sunday $currentYear-05", "")); // mothers day
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("4th friday $currentYear-05", "last monday $currentYear-05", "")); // memorial day
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("second friday $currentYear-06", "third sunday $currentYear-06", "")); // fathers day
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("third monday $currentYear-06", "third monday $currentYear-06", "")); // juneteenth
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("$currentYear-09-01", "first monday $currentYear-09", "")); // labor day

// static holidays
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("january 1", "january 1", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("february 14", "february 14", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("march 17", "march 17", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("april 22", "april 22", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("june 14", "june 14", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("july 1", "july 4", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("november 11", "november 11", ""));

// special months
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("february 1", "february 29", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("march 1", "march 31", ""));
$holidayMappings = array_push($holidayMappings, new HolidayMapping("october 1", "october 31", ""));

$currentDate = date(DATE_FORMAT);

$sequenceName = null;
foreach($holidayMapping in $holidayMappings)
{
    if ($holidayMapping->startDate >= $currentDate && $holidayMapping->endDate <= $currentDate)
    {
        $sequenceName = $holidayMapping->sequence;
        break;
    }
}

if ($sequenceName === null)
{
    $sequenceName = BLUE_LIGHTS;
}

// make curl call to start playlist on loop

```


## Turn Off Lights

A simple command was used to turn off the lights at the scheduled time by sending 
the Graceful Stop command to FPP.

```sh

```
