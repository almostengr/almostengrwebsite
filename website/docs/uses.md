## Background

Browsing around on GitHub, I found that developers create "uses" (or /uses) pages that
detail the tools that they use do their work. Below are a list of tools that are used to get
the job done. For more detail about what is a Uses page and how you can create your own,
you can check out [the blog post](/technology/2020.02.01-developer-uses-page) about this topic.

## Handyman Tools

Below are the tools that would make up the handyman toolbox or tool set. The Basic Tools are
relatively common because they are used on fasteners on number of items including ceiling fans, electrical
outlets, and furniture, just to name a few.

### Basic Tools

* Hammer
* Screwdriver Set (Phillips Head and Flat Head)
* Tongue and Groove Pliers

### Additional Tools

The Advanced Tools are more for the hardcore DIY-er, those that enjoy doing Saturday Projects, and
handymen and handywomen.

* Circular Saw
* Miter Saw
* Reciprocating Saw
* Lawn Mower
* Weed Trimmer
